He has tea every morning.
Leave!
What time is it now?
Tom didn't come home until 2:30.
It's all you can really do.
I've got one just like that.
Stand aside.
We'll go to any length to send our child to a good university.
Pick the one you like best.
It's a waste of time and a waste of money.
Who's hungry?
Mr. Tanaka can play the piano well.
Wash the dishes.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Are these your shoes?
She loves to cook.
You drink tea.
I didn't want to do it.
They told us what they knew.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
She shot down a helicopter.
Eat fruits!
This is for me.
I don't understand.
Tom and Mary don't know that I wish they'd leave.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
It is not raining.
Do you have a steady boyfriend?
But they are all people.
Out!
This chair is light.
He lost his job through his irresponsibility.
Yes.
Smile!
Dan's pitbull attacked Linda's small dog.
Where do you live?
I can't get anything right.
I feel like I'm stealing your sentences.
She will give a party next week.
I told my parents everything.
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
Please try one.
Whose are these pens?
Cool off!
Tom wasn't very motivated to do that.
A drop of sweat ran down his temple.
Choose one.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
I saw the hill.
He showed us how to ride a horse.
There's one more.
One day, she told me that she wanted a pet cat.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom here before.
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
I have no energy.
It is very cold today.
These pants don't fit me.
I heard that he could even translate from Ancient Hebrew.
Quick!
This is a folding fan, and this is how you open it. It's for hot summer days.
I had already eaten before I arrived at the party.
Quiet!
It's too hot.
Tom, behind you!
Stop. That tickles.
He likes to smoke while taking a shit.
The land is very fertile.
The moon is shining.
The behavior did his reputation no good.
Tom, behind you!
Farting is rude.
Since when have you been learning Latin?
Tom and Mary are outside.
Where is the toilet?
I'm not sure who has my suitcases.
Pardon me, but that is my racket.
This is difficult.
What is your name?
I didn't pick it up.
I extended my holiday.
Why do you always ask so many questions?
Choose one.
Scram!
Want one?
We must leave immediately.
It was me who killed Kennedy.
Tom said it was all like a dream.
Do you know how much profit we made?
Are you still able to speak your tribal language?
Chill.
I still can't remember the words to that song.
Please get out of the kitchen.
Listen.
Whose are these pens?
Tom is the strongest.
I'll see you at home.
Tom smiled when Mary looked at him.
Tom knows about this, doesn't he?
Sami is not afraid of the jungle.
I didn't give Tom anything.
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
Poor cat.
It's raining.
She looked at me.
I extended my holiday.
My butt hurts.
Pick it up.
The store will be closed tomorrow.
He gave the same answer as before.
It won't fly!
We eat together every evening.
The earth rotates.
Enough!
Hi.
Don't tickle me!
This sentence is mine.
Louder.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
Tom and Mary can no longer do their jobs.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
Tom is going to hurt you.
This belongs to me.
Because it is there.
He stood there for a while.
Bearing can be unbearable.
Very!
They want Tom back.
Sami needs to trust Layla.
He was right to keep silent.
If they were Canadians, this problem wouldn't exist.
How did you get permission to do that?
Love the earth.
Metal contracts when cooled.
We speak Japanese.
Come!
He is lying on the baby.
Hurry up.
Tom wants you.
All swans are white.
You can go if you want to.
I'll get him to carry this box upstairs.
How should I know?
Will you please explain to me the exact meaning of the word?
Do you have time tomorrow?
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
Sami was never respectful to me.
Farting is rude.
There's something that I've been wanting to ask you.
Tom has lots of friends.
What are those called?
Stars are beautiful.
What?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Tell me how you found out that I did that.
I remember that.
Cows have horns.
Stand up!
Toronto's mayor was caught on tape smoking crack.
Sami is a good dad.
Why don't we play tennis on Sunday?
She picked flowers.
He plays beach volleyball.
Tom is way too young to be doing this.
Take cover!
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
He said he needs to go shopping.
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
Not everything Tom said was true.
I understand why you're angry.
Give Tom everything he asks for.
Have you washed your hands yet?
The toilet is upstairs.
Fly!
Break the eggs and remove the yolks.
I want you to kiss me.

I've been up all night writing.
Who are you?
I don't want to go to school.
Read this book.
Tom is the strongest.
Germany is a cold country.
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
Tom, behind you!
You can go if you want to.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
Tom, behind you!
Run!
Hello!
Cover your eyes.
Jesus Christ!
There is no necessity for you to do that.
He has a bruise on his right leg.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
I remember that.
Did you have a good sleep?
What?
Want one?
Me!
Tom and Mary looked like they hadn't slept in days.
Tom is liked by his friends.
These pants don't fit me.
I'm sure you're very busy.
You're the one who should pay the bill.
Goodbye!
It's impossible to fix.
Are you deaf?
Who's hungry?
I'm sorry.
Choose.
I had to let her win.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Please try one.
A pair of earrings is a nice present for her.
Kneel!
I need you.
You're very fast at putting my sentences there.
I would like you to sing a song.
What were you doing when she came?
Want one?
Tom is just finishing setting up.
We thought you might want to come with us.
He thanked me with his eyes.
Mary gave it to me before she died.

She said that she was full.
He admitted that he was biased.
How do you use this camera?
You drink tea.

You can't escape from me.
Impossible.
Goodbye!
Where would you like to go?
Remember!
I know you have an essay to write.
Tom was my first Facebook friend.
Here lives one bear.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
What is your name?
I had just put it before you ask me to.
Do you like the movie?
What is 'terpomo'? An apple in the ground, or a potato?
Poor cat.
I'm not going to tell them that.
I haven't seen her for a long time.
What are those numbers?
It's hot today.
I don't like this paper. It's too shiny.
Everyone has been affected.
Tom hit me first.
My car is parked over there.
Don't you want to stop Tom?
I don't have any children yet.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
How am I going to impress Tom?
Tom, behind you!
I was jealous of you.
Read this first.
What languages do you know?
Are you deaf?
Tom put his arm around Mary and kissed her cheek.
Tom pulled out his key and opened the door.
Where are you?
This is good.
Leave!
I was just making sure.
You're just not the person I thought you were.
Speak softly.
Tom put his pistol under the pillow.
Watch out!
Tom seems sincere.
I wonder what Tom wants.
I just hope Mary does what we asked her to do.
Tom borrowed some money from us.
Fry.
You can't escape from me.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
I don't know how to swim.
There is very little water in your coffee.
Blah.
I came because of something you wrote.
The toilet is upstairs.
I'm here because I have to be here.
Buy!
You haven't even tried.
Can you hear me?
He is in need of money.
He has ten cows.
It'd be about time to reply to his letter.
Pray.
He demoted you.
I'm learning Japanese.
We should give this a try.
Why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors?
Look behind you.
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
They're all scared of Tom.
Watch yourself.
It's hot.
Tom and Mary don't want to retire.
She teased him.
Tom is the most boring person I know.
Please.
Where is the toilet?
We could say that both of those balls are the same weight.
The one hundred metre run starts at two in the afternoon.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
Thanks for everything.
It won't fly!
Tom, behind you!
There's one more.
A long time ago when Pluto was still a planet, there was a boy named Tom.
I called at his office yesterday.
At the end of the sentence one should put a period.
Poor cat.
Tom and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
Look!
She strangled a cat.
Eat slowly.
Hurry up.
Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.

He is lying on the baby.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Next time, don't drop it.

Therefore?
Eat!
Like master, like disciple.
Wash your face.
That book is a new book.
We must work as long as we live.
Fuck!
Look behind you.
You can't escape from me.
You can't escape from me.
Very!
What else is there?

You should use a deodorant.
Come quick!
Tom and Mary claim they've done that already.
There are islands in the sea.
Ouch!
Thank you!
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
The truth bears hatred.
Where would you like to go?
Tom told Mary that he didn't know how to play the saxophone.
You can't escape from me.
Brian lives over the hill.
She picked flowers.
Are you crazy?
I saw Tom running down the street.
He spoke to me when he saw me.
Bye!

I just want him to go away.
Can you hear me?
I'm pretty sure Tom can do it.

Tom can't believe Mary is really planning to go.
Sorry.
That was really sweet.
You can't escape from me.
When does it begin?
Anyway.
Mary had to admit she was wrong.
Why?
I don't think that Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
What do you want?
Are you deaf?
Wash the dishes.
Your room is twice the size of mine.
I'll be right in here.
Tom's phone rang.
They won't permit you to do that here.
How foolish!
It is the tallest tree that I ever saw.
Bears can climb trees.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
My shoes are brown.
Why don't I understand English?
Smile!
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
"Remember your promise!" "Don't worry! I can keep a secret!"
Is Tom in surgery?
Tom and Mary said they didn't think John really needed to do that today.
Where would you like to go?
How did their glasses get swapped? Even they themselves didn't understand it!
I'm not going to go back.
It used to be such fun.
Why are you late?
Jesus answered them.
Where is the toilet?
Tom didn't keep Mary waiting too long.
Can I make a phone call?
Do I have to make a speech?
I'll get him to carry this box upstairs.
This is difficult.
We should be getting back.
When is school over?
I think we need to find out where Tom and Mary are.
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me.
I don't want to go to school.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
Sami went through Layla's stuff.
Grab him.
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
I remember that.
We're going to help her.
You must keep quiet.
Stop tickling me!
Pick it up.
What do you want?
We will clarify what is true and what is false.
Tom stepped on some broken glass.
You drink tea.
Pass me the pen.
They pretended they were afraid.
Crazy!
Finally!
Strange.
What'll change?
The hill is always green.
Is this lake deep?
Why do I need to learn French?
Alright.
What?
What do you do for the team?

Fire!
Kneel!
We are going to the market.
Mary said that she wanted to die.
Tom told Mary to try harder.
I am coming.
Die!
Remember!
Why do you think Tom and Mary are stupid?
You seem to ask Tom a lot of questions.
I'm just asking.
See you tomorrow.
When is your birthday?
Everybody's got something to hide.
I don't remember if Tom lent me the book or if I borrowed it from the library.
He left without having shut the door.
Thanks, everyone.
How are we going to do that?
Children need loving.
She was wearing a fur coat.
Are these your shoes?
He is eight.
You drink tea.
How should I know?
You can't escape from me.
What were you doing when she came?
Tom threw a rock at one of my dogs.
She invited me to eat.
He arrived here just now.
I'd visit Boston if I were you.
We've come home.
How should I know?
Who are you?
These pants don't fit me.
Thank you very much!
Why doesn't he eat lunch with me anymore?
Correct!
Wait.
Wash your face.
Mary threw Tom under the bus.
How do people like you get to be people like you?
Tom is the only one who really knows what to do.
When is school over?
What do you want?
Where else would I go?
I think I'll be very busy, but after the test I will have more time.
What are those?
I walked up the hill.
Tom has found out Mary can't read.
You didn't break it.
She picked flowers.
It's really annoying.
Read this first.
Pick the one you like best.
I know we can take care of ourselves if we try.
Don't worry.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
They said they were afraid to go there.
What else are you planning to do?
Where are you?
Do you like the movie?
Tom wanted Mary to go away.
If you know the answer to this question, please tell me.
They said they were afraid to go there.
Please try one.
Don't you think it strange that he is not here?
When I woke up, I was in the car.
I have a friend.
Eat everything.
When the house caught fire, an awful feeling came over me.
He can't say one word of French, but then again he speaks English like a native.
Where would you like to go?
What is your name?
Why can't animals talk?
Tom and Mary could've done that, but they didn't.
Done.
Her mother lives in the country all by herself.
I no longer need a loan.
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine.
Are these your shoes?
Pretty!
The toilet is upstairs.
They won't permit you to do that here.
Tom is the strongest.
I'm so hungry!
Is there a tennis court around here?
I didn't pick it up.
You're not the only one who's hungry.
I love you.
I like funny guys.
Look behind you.
It's hot today.
I feel bad for them.
I bought a pen for your birthday present.
Hello!
Here?
It never occurred to me that Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
They said they were afraid to go there.
I'm here to stay.
Tom just saved my life.
Please keep your voice down.
That hurts.
I'm pretty sure that Tom can do it.
Is there something you want to ask me for?
Honestly...
Tell me where the wine is.
I'm very pleased to be here.
All swans are white.
Beware!
The toilet is upstairs.
It's hot.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think they could do that now.
I am eating rice.
Speak!
Tom is the strongest.
Did anybody come?
What is the name of this river?
I didn't vote for you.
Fuck!
You can't escape from me.
Bring tea.
If possible, I'd like to read more about the issue.
I didn't even have time to paint!
I know Tom and Mary are going to hate this.
I knew very little about him.
Fight!
It is raining.
Goodbye!
The situation is worse than we believed.
That hurts.
You really do ask a lot of questions, don't you?
If not now, when?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
She never saw her sister again.
She's with her dogs.
Sami is a good dad.
Who was taking care of Tom when this happened?
Goodnight!
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me.
What were you doing at that time?
Who runs the fastest of the three?
This is difficult.
Fight!
I've been to Boston numerous times.
She lied to protect her family.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
A river flows.
Stand aside.
How do you know Tom is there?
What is the name of this river?
Please be so kind as to show me the way to the station.
You're the biggest.
I don't like this paper. It's too shiny.
Where would you like to go?
She picked flowers.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
Mary lives in her own world.
Ow!
Sami forced Layla to lie.
Mary doesn't like milk in her coffee.
Are you sure?
Louder.
Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.
I'm going to Tom's office.
I had to let her win.
I was bothered by the baby's crying.
I'm not sure who has my suitcases.
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
Did you happen to see her yesterday?
Jump.
I didn't know why.
Because she takes after her younger sister, I cannot tell one from the other.
Pack your bags.
I'm not calling you by name.
Where's the director?
Why don't you like me?
Wash your hands.
What were you doing when she came?
This is very good.
Leave!
Look behind you.
We often do what we have to do, not what we want to do.
Tom lives in his own world.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
I want you, Tom.
Tom is the strongest.
I want you, Tom.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
She puts the children to bed.
Why?
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
I saw Tom running down the street.
Tom and I became friends when we both lived in Boston.
They could've done it by themselves.
This is difficult.
Quiet!
The truth bears hatred.
How smart!
What is your name?
Tom put on his sunglasses.
Tom asked me a lot of questions that I couldn't answer.
I take it as a sign of hope.
You didn't break it.
Why do you need a new television?
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
That's impossible for me.
Just tell me what's going on.
Mr So-and-So is dead. Why would I bother going to his funeral since, I am certain, he won't come to mine?
Are these your shoes?
One more time, please.
Crazy!
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
You should probably buy a ticket for Tom, too.
Hungry?
Quick!
I'm sorry.
People are speaking at the same time.
The river overflowed.
A lot of people drowned when the ship sank.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
He demoted you.
A computer game was given to me by my father.
Poor cat.
I advised Tom not to waste his time trying to do that.
Have you ever been to Minnesota?
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
Sit tight.
Read this first.
I feel like shit.
I didn't give Tom anything.
Hello.
I've got beer.
I've spent most of my life here.
This chair is ugly.
Tom and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
The stars came out.
I have to go to the toilet.
You can go if you want to.
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Tom and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
What're you saying?
Tom went on a picnic with Mary and her family.
Kiss my ass.
What were you doing at that time?
I saw Tom give a flower Mary.
It's still breathing.
Sit tight.
How old are you?
What're they doing?
Mary says she's not busy tomorrow.
She folded the quilt.
D.H. Lawrence is a novelist and poet.
Enter!
Are you deaf?
I am.
Tell me where the wine is.
You drink tea.
Yes.
It took me by surprise.
Since when?
I have an erection.
Are these your shoes?
She speaks as if she had really been in France.
Who's hungry?
Understood?
These pants don't fit me.
Who runs the fastest of the three?
Recently.
This is good.
What languages do you know?
What is your name?
I eat.
Thank you with all my heart.
I am asking questions to my father.
These pens are his.
Tom fell down the stairs.
Answer!
Likewise.
Me!
She looked at me.
I know you have it with you.
I went to Tokyo to buy this book.
Study!
Play!
My house is very cold.
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
He doesn't look like he's tired.
Holy cow!
Follow the stars.
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
You may do what you wish.
I think it is good that books still exist, but they do make me sleepy.
Please try one.
Did you buy me anything?
Fool!
Understood?
Tom hasn't been swimming in a long time.
I knew very little about him.
One more time, please.
Would you mind calling Tom for me?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
We work for Tom.
Who?
You're the biggest.
I did everything to become your friend.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
That book is a new book.
Have you ever been to Minnesota?
I didn't say that. That's your interpretation.
I love you.
Tom and Mary are outside.
I remember that.
That is mine.
Each of them has his own car.
Tom and Mary won't allow dogs in their houses.
Always.
How weird is that?
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
Tom was the first one to volunteer to help us.
I just want to forget about it.
Tom began to move.
In fact, Tom told me never to come back to his house again.
I don't know if he has any special powers or not, but he's probably stronger than a normal human.
Jesus wept.
When was that?
He is tall and strong.
We want what's best for you.
Bear with me.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Watch the road.
Friend me on Facebook. Huh, what's that? Really, so you don't do Facebook? You must not have any friends. That's terrible.
It's too late to try that.
Mother Earth.
I have a friend.
How are you?
Precisely!
How do you know Tom is there?
You can't escape from me.
Why does this have to be done?
Dead?
What were you doing at that time?
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
One more time.
Are these your shoes?
He had the right to defend himself.
I'm going to Australia the month after next.
Cows give us milk.
Jupiter is so large that all of the other planets in the solar system could fit inside of it.
It's too late to try that.
He leaves at eight.
The moon has set.
I'll figure out a way to fix this. Don't worry.
Ow!
You agree with Tom, right?
The forest was covered with snow and the evenings were quiet as animals slept through the cold winter nights.
Most Japanese temples are made of wood.
You drink tea.
No.
Tom must've been very disappointed.
Wrong.
I'll kick your butt!
She wrote me a long letter.
Goodbye!
Watch out!
He is in need of money.
It has been ten years since my father passed away.
Duh.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
I've got one just like that.
Do you want to come sit by me?
I've always hated her.
Quieter!
You can't escape from me.
You're very fast at putting my sentences there.
Here?
Achoo!
Tom fell off his mother's lap.
It took Tom several hours to assemble a bunk bed that the instructions said would take less than an hour to assemble.
We thought you might want to come with us.
We'll fail.
Tom is the strongest.
Tom, behind you!
The bear bites itself.
Tom lost his camera in Boston.
I can't decide which route to take to Boston.
Ned held the flag erect.
Are you crazy?
Correct!
I love you.
Tom and Mary are very close.
He left all kinds of papers on his desk.
Mary gave it to me before she died.
This is very good.
Did you get a good look at her?
You can't escape from me.
The leader should know where to set up the tent.
I'm so hungry!
I don't think like you.
Ow!
Tom is the only one who really knows what to do.
I did not hear you.
I'm sorry. I came late.
Dead?
"Let the English and the French take all the land they want," said the Indian chief. "But they want to take all the land between the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, is it OK?" said Tom.
We'll fail.
Tom said that he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Unbelievable!
I'll do what must be done.
Aren't you going to give me a kiss?
Either skillful or lazy. But not both.
I'm losing business.
What were you doing at that time?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
Tom has lots of friends in Australia.
He remained silent for a while.
Whose are these pens?
Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.
Sing!
Now, I write with the new font.
I didn't mean to stare.
What were you doing when she came?
Anger is an energy.
They live downstairs.
Tom had to pay a fine because he parked in the wrong place.
This account does not agree with the facts.
Very good, thank you.
There's one more.
My butt hurts.
Mary misled you.
My ass!
These animals are friendly.
I like Chinese and Japanese.
I told my parents everything.
A telephone is more useful than a necklace.
Poor cat.
Try!
Sleep!
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
Your dreams are almost as twisted as my nightmares.
Duh.
Will you please go there?
Mary grabbed her coat and left.
I'm just joking.
Choose one.
Don't tickle me!
Just get up.
What is the name of this river?
How do you take off the shell of a boiled egg cleanly? Is there some sort of trick?
I know how to swim.
Idiot!
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
Stop tickling me!
I don't want to know anything about that.
I really thought Tom and Mary were hungry.
It didn't go well.
When will I get to see the effect of this soap?
Do you see the garden?
Don't repeat the same mistake!
Should we try to help?
Shit.
Pack your bags.
Have you already bought your ticket?
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
The truth is I told a lie.
Begin!
Thank you for boiling the water.
She teased him.
Sometimes my dog barks in the middle of the night.
Whatever!
You can go if you want to.
Don't tell a lie. Be honest.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
Hooray!
How do people like you get to be people like you?
Tom won the election.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Nonsense!
I have two cats.
Tom asked me a lot of questions that I couldn't answer.
I don't have time.
They seem to know all about us.
Are you crazy?
What were you doing at that time?
How could this sort of thing possibly happen?
Hurry up.
We live on Earth.
The storm sank the boat.
Cows eat grass.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
Tom is going to hurt you.
I'm not the only one who's hungry.
Wow!
Be cool.
Stand still!
This is difficult.
If I'd seen Mary yesterday, I would've talked to her.
I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Mary said she doesn't want to ever do that again.
Tokyo is bigger than Yokohama.
Stand up!
You guys have too much time on your hands.
Leave it behind.
Really?
Mary hastily packed her suitcase.
I love God.
Where are you now?
You can go if you want to.
Stand aside.
Sami smoked weed before he joined the military.
Hush!
I want you to read this book.
What else?
Are you deaf?
Look at the picture.
What's your name?
Tom, behind you!
Tom gave his seat to an elderly lady.
That news got around.
Lazybones.
He demoted you.
Tom handed the photo album to Mary.
These are pens.
You don't have to go to school tomorrow.
"You slept with her!" "I did not."
I don't want to know anything about Tom.
How cute!
I can't believe we're all still here.
Have you already heard that he has finally returned home?
Jump.
He was drunk and forgot to shut the back door.
Where is the toilet?
I don't think they're going to hear us.
It's too hot.
Please cover yourself.
Tom and Mary still don't know who John is.
Tom has found out Mary can't read.
Does anybody hear me?
You're just not the person I thought you were.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
He kicked it.
What's happening now in Poland?
Pack your bags.
Nuclear weapons are a threat to the race.
Give Tom everything he asks for.
I met him at a party.
Cows live on grass.
Where's the director?
Help me.
Yes.
I tried to install a new browser.
How are your studies going?
Tom and Mary own the house up the street.
I am learning Japanese.
Do you know what this is all about?
I've got one just like that.
He leaves at eight.
It took me by surprise.
What is your name?
He practices playing the guitar far into the night.
There are only books on the shelf.
The moon is shining.
You don't know the system.
Speak softly.
Thank you, Jesus.
Tom smiled when Mary looked at him.
You're just not the person I thought you were.
His fart smelled.
Eat everything.
I don't think like you.
Very good, thank you.
Are you crazy?
What is the name of this river?
Sell!
I'm OK for now.
Wash the dishes.
This is a cat.
Tom quickly opened the drawer and pulled out a gun.
I gave it my best shot.
What are those numbers?
Bear with me.
Mary doesn't like her new sofa.
Did anybody come?
Maybe.
You didn't know Mary was supposed to do that by herself, did you?
Tom never saw Mary.
I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
Do you speak English?
I think I may know where to find Tom.
I can't put up with Tom's bad manners any longer.
Tom and Mary said they wished they could do that as well as John.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
I have dandruff.
Sami was watching this video.
What is your name?
How wonderful!
Tom will die without your help.
There won't be a next time.
Tom is still paying attention.
I don't know.
Yummy!
Tom was kneeling.
I don't think like you.
He's closed-minded.
I didn't know why.
Pull yourself together!
I will do it.
Tom and Mary weren't much help.
My shoes are brown.
Fuck!
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
Wash your hands.
Tom, behind you!
These pens are his.
Whatever!
Ouch!
Pass me the pen.
Watch the road.
He is one of the greatest scientists in the world.
The sky looks angry.
It looks like Tom and Mary are home.
Leave now.
Perfect!
Take the other chair!
How are we going to do that?
Please try one.
Nonsense.
Push.
I thank you.
You'll cook for us tonight, won't you?
Hurry up.
Idiot!
That's impossible.
She said she wanted to marry me.
They exchanged hellos.
We've got something.
Why aren't they here?
Not everything Tom said was true.
Yes.
Pack your bags.
Look behind you.
I just need some aspirin.
We thought you might want to come with us.
Why are you all shocked?
Tom is going to hurt you.
Yes, I have time tomorrow.
Tom was glad to hear Mary's voice.
Quick!
Stop!
They called you.
I don't know how to prove I wasn't in Boston.
We want what's best for you.
I'm not eating this fish.
Poor cat.
They said they were afraid to go there.
Whatever!
What were you doing when she came?
Tom went without food for a whole week.
What are you doing?
Jesus loves you.
I have supported you throughout.
Mary cut up all the pictures she had of Tom.
I want to rent a car, please show me a price list.
Watch.
Again.
It didn't go well.
It's not blood. It's beet.
In my opinion, the meeting was a success.
What were you doing when she came?
He arrived here just now.
I want to go back to my friends.
Tom was even busier than I was.
That was unfortunate.
Mary said she thought Tom would be glad to see her.
I need this.
My name's Tom.
The truth bears hatred.
We've got something.
I had a suspicion that he would leave me.
Since Mary is sick, I'm sure she won't do that.
We must work as long as we live.
Go.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Mary promised me that she'd do that before she went home.
Where are you?
Tom wants answers.
It's so good to take a rest after a long voyage.
I don't know if Tom is coming or not.
Tom lives alone with his dog.
I just got up.
I'd like some plum jam.
What are those called?
Moreover, when viewed from the side, the front teeth are protruding.
This is not a cat. This is a dog.
It's refreshing.
Nowadays no one believes in ghosts.
Tom said he didn't remember much.
You're not the only one who's hungry.
Write!
The sky brightened.
Tom splashed Mary and she splashed him back.
English is not spoken here.
How long do we have to wait here?
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom didn't tell anybody he wanted to do that.
How do people like you get to be people like you?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I didn't drink the water.
Where is the ship?
We'll fail.
He jumped over a ditch.
He is lying on the baby.
I'm a Christian.
It needs washing.
He spoke to me when he saw me.
Because she felt sick.
They already know what they'll do.
Tom, behind you!
Correct.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
Tom has asked Mary to help him.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
Tennis is difficult. I never know which way the ball is going to fly.
There were once a King and a Queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, who was very strong and active, and good-looking.
I have a friend.
So?
The hospital where Tom was born is in Australia.
Play!
I'll see you at home.
Tom tried to restart the car, but couldn't.
This book is easy for me to read.
You can't escape from me.
Tom looks sad.
Let's hope that Mary can handle that by herself.
I'll take the jacket.
What're you saying?
He is stronger than me.
Mother Earth.
Do you know who Tom's mother is?
He is sitting in the front seat.
He is eight.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
A mother rabbit keeps her babies warm with her own body.
Where are you?
Get out of my house!
How do you know Tom is there?
Right?
My name is Tom.
What're they doing?
She's got a fair complexion while her brother is very dark.
It didn't work out quite like I intended it to.
What are those called?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Do you know who Tom's mother is?
Walk.
This is for me.
But why?
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom has already taught me how to do that.
Of course.
She chatted with her friends about the baseball game.
I was so cold.
Stand still!
Pull yourself together!
Help!
You can't escape from me.
Earth laughs in flowers.
My car's in the garage.
When's dinner?
I was late, so I missed flight 501.
Look behind you.
I'm not usually picky about food.
There is no necessity for you to do that.
Are you deaf?
These chairs are different.
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom is a couple of years older than me, I think.
I just want him to go away.
Coffee gives you energy!
Cows give milk.
Really!
Tom didn't tell anybody he wanted to do that.
This is difficult.
I want him gone by noon.
He has a bruise on his right leg.
Why do you think Tom and Mary are stupid?
I love that chair.
Bye!
You can tell me tomorrow.
Watch out!
No.
You can go if you want to.
We've got something.
Tom doesn't realise how his behaviour affects others.
They haven't finished their lunch yet.
No.
Where's the director?
For me it was a question of life or death.
My guess is that Tom isn't going to want that.
Are they Japanese?
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Do you speak English?
I'll see you at home.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Tom hired me to paint his house.
Give tea.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
We've got something.
Pull!
Tom didn't come home until 2:30.
Halt!
Stars are beautiful.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
Please sit.
I don't want to disturb you.
I just laughed because everyone else did.
Tom, behind you!
Why don't I understand English?
Idiot!
Hey.
Pull it open.
Why did you agree?
You're welcome.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
Tom soon caught up with Mary.
Eat noodles.
The other day I ran out of gas in the middle of a busy Interstate.
Eat everything.
I was looking for the barbershop.
Tom got out of prison after 30 years.
You can't afford this.
I did not hear you.
What is your name?
Tom, behind you!
Will you guys please stop fighting?
She knows that as well.
If you want peace, prepare for war.
I'll see you at home.
