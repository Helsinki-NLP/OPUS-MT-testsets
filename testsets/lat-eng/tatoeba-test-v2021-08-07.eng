If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession above all people: for all the earth is mine.
If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
If the thief be not known, the master of the house shall be brought to the gods, and shall swear that he did not lay his hand upon his neighbour's goods.
If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and beholdeth.
If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve thee; in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

If you speak Esperanto you can travel in many countries. Come and learn it!

Sooth, then, shall she return / to Sparta and Mycenae, ay, and see / home, husband, sons and parents, safe and free, / with Ilian wives and Phrygians in her train, / a queen, in pride of triumph? Shall this be, / and Troy have blazed and Priam's self been slain, / and Trojan blood so oft have soaked the Dardan plain?

So spake the seer, and shipward bids his friends / rich gifts convey, and store them in the hold. / Gold, silver plate, carved ivory he sends, / with massive caldrons of Dodona's mould; / a coat of mail, with triple chain of gold, / and shining helm, with cone and flowing crest, / the arms of Pyrrhus, glorious to behold.

Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, and didst defile his couch.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not mercy, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in thy most firm habitation, which thou hast made, O Lord; thy sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
Thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy children for ever.
Thou shalt live by the sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.
Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands to them that love me, and keep my commandments.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; neither shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.
Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar, lest thy nakedness be discovered.
Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.
Thou stretchedst forth thy hand, and the earth swallowed them.
"Thou, Troy, preserved, to Sinon faithful stay, / if true the tale I tell, if large the price I pay."
"Thou, who alone Troy's sorrows deign'st to hear, / and us, the gleanings of the Danaan spear, / poor world-wide wanderers and in desperate case, / has ta'en to share thy city and thy cheer, / meet thanks nor we, nor what of Dardan race / yet roams the earth, can give to recompense thy grace."
Three children were playing in the park.
Three more / fierce Eurus from the deep sea dashed ashore / on quicks and shallows, pitiful to view, / and round them heaped the sandbanks.
Thrice had Achilles round the Trojan wall / dragged Hector; there the slayer sells the slain.
Thrice roar the caverned shore-cliffs, thrice the spray / whirls up and wets the dewy stars on high.
Through difficulties to honors.
Thus also said God to Noah, and to his sons with him: Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you: And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.
Thus always to tyrants!
Thus he, / and, ere his speech was ended, smoothed the main, / and chased the clouds and brought the sun again.
Thus passes the glory of the world.
"Thus roused, her friends she gathers. All await / her summons, who the tyrant fear or hate. / Some ships at hand, chance-anchored in the bay / they seize and load them with the costly freight, / and far off o'er the deep is borne away / Pygmalion's hoarded pelf. A woman leads the way."
Thus tired we drift, as sinks the wind and day, / unto the Cyclops' shore, all weetless of the way.
Thus we, elate, but not with Heaven our friend, / march on and mingle with the Greeks in fight, / and many a Danaan to the shades we send. / And many a battle in the blinding night / we join with those that meet us.
Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove's, thy neck as jewels.

Up rose my sire, submissive to the sign, / and briefly to the Gods addressed his prayer, / and bowed adoring to the star divine.

"Wilt thou not see, if yet thy sire survive, / worn out with age, amid the war's alarms? / And if thy wife Creusa be alive, / and young Ascanius? for around thee swarms / the foe, and but for my protecting arms, / fierce sword or flame had swept them all away."
Winds roll the waters, and the great seas rise. / Dispersed we welter on the gulfs. Damp night / has snatched with rain the heaven from our eyes, / and storm-mists in a mantle wrapt the light. / Flash after flash, and for a moment bright, / quick lightnings rend the welkin. Driven astray / we wander, robbed of reckoning, reft of sight. / No difference now between the night and day / e'en Palinurus sees, nor recollects the way.
Winter is the season I like best.
Wisdom follows me, but I am faster.
Wise is the man of few words.
Within are fifty maidens, charged with care / to dress the food, and nurse the flames divine. / A hundred more, and youths like-aged, prepare / to load the tables and arrange the wine.
With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies. Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps he come and kill the mother with the children.
"With twice ten ships I climbed the Phrygian main, / my goddess-mother pointing out the way, / as Fate commanded. Now scarce seven remain, / wave-worn and shattered by the tempest's strain."

Would not you reckon the alchymist for a god, that could add ten years to the sum of your life, and call back advanced age to the vigour of youth?
Wouldn't you hate a man very much who could and would shorten your life by some years through the evil arts? I judge those who voluntarily shorten their own lives as much worse and more criminal.
Wouldn‚Äôt you think an alchemist to be a god, if he could add ten years to your lifespan, and bring back old age to the vigour of youth?
"Would that your king AEneas here could stand, / driven by the gale that drove you to this strand! / Natheless, to scour the country, will I send / some trusty messengers, with strict command / to search through Libya to the furthest end, / lest, cast ashore, through town or lonely wood he wend."

Yea, and more, / in war enduring, ere he built a home, / and his loved household-deities brought o'er / to Latium, whence the Latin people come, / whence rose the Alban sires, and walls of lofty Rome.
