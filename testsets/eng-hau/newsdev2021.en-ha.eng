Ganduje responds to allegations of selling Daula Hotel - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano State Governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has said his government is reclaiming abandoned state-owned assets to provide for infrastructure, which is a step towards making Kano State one of the world's greatest cities.
This is contained in a statement signed by Aminu Yassar, Director of Information, Kano State Government House.
The statement said that instead of abandoning assets to be wasted, assets that the government has spent a lot of money to obtain, it would be better to turn them into places that benefit the community.

Abba Kabir Yusuf, the PDP's candidate for governor of Kano State in the last general election, has recently filed a lawsuit alleging that the step that the state government has taken is a misappropriation of government assets.
Gottlieb warns uncontrolled coronavirus spread in a community makes it "very hard to open" schools in fall
Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday it's going to be "very hard" for school districts to open for the upcoming academic year if there is uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus within their communities.
"For local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community.
If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop." Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."
With the fall semester set to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had been urging school districts to open their doors to students for in-person instruction five days a week.
But the push from President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos comes as Mr. Trump warned last week the coronavirus crisis will likely "get worse before it gets better" and acknowledged school districts in hot spots may have to delay reopening for a few weeks.
Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance Thursday for how best to safely open schools for students.
The guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing, recommend students and staff wear face coverings, and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others, among other guidelines.
But the CDC did not provide a benchmark for school administrators on when they should move to close a school in the event of an uptick in coronavirus infections, which Gottlieb said was "unfortunate."
"In the setting of uncertainty and the lack of specific guidance for how to keep schools open, I think more parents are going to err on the side of caution," he said.
"That's why it's very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that the CDC didn't do in its guidance."
Gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community, local spread and testing capacity to guide decision-making on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning.
A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is "starting to get iffy," while above 10% is the "threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts."
"That is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community," Gottlieb said, adding that it's going to be difficult for parts of Florida, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., to open their schools for in-person learning next month.
More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.
But Gottlieb said there are indications cases in some states including Arizona and Texas are beginning to plateau.
While Gottlieb said there are "unmistakable signs" the epidemic is slowing in some states across the Sun Belt, it's "heating up" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.
Many governors have instituted mandates requiring people to wear masks when they are in public spaces and halted their phased reopenings in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues, and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic, steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in March.
In addition to states issuing mask mandates, a number of businesses are requiring customers to wear face coverings as well.
McDonald's is among the latest to require face coverings, and the fast food giant joins Walmart, Starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks.
Gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues, especially those considered high-risk.
"If we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness, just with masks that's going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesn't really change our lives and allows us to maintain what's really important to us like keeping some businesses open, like getting our kids back to school," he said.
While Mr. Trump has said he will not impose a nationwide mask mandate, he urged Americans last week to wear coverings, saying during a White House press briefing "they have an impact."

The Reason Why We Expelled our Greedy Officer - NSCDC chairman.
The chairman of the National Civil Defense, Muhammad Gana Abdullahi, explained the reason why his commission dismissed its officer after he was seen in a video carrying goods snatched during the EndSARS protests in Gwagalada in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, sometime ago.
Gana explained the reason for the commission in an interview with LEADERSHIP TODAY at the commission's headquarters in Abuja, saying that in order to maintain proper discipline among the staff, the commission decided to terminate the officer from service.
While explaining the situation, Ghana said, "You who have been sent to provide security... they called me and said they were 16 at the place, but the people who went there, were more than 500, and I also heard that information, and even some of the security officials had run away. Then I told them to fall back and not to use any force.
So, you who have been sent to provide security there, why do you go and engage in picking up forbidden goods, and you were photographed doing that?
Certainly that is not good!
Therefore I immediately called our management, we sat down and we reached the decision to dismiss him from service.
This teach a lesson of good behavior to the rest of the staff, that is, we will not tolerate misconduct in the Civil Defense.
When LEADERSHIP TODAY pointed out that there were officers from some security agencies who were also videotaped taking the forbidden goods, but there were no reports of their bosses firing them, he also responded.
"We, as for us at Civil Defense, we have taken the necessary steps, and for the rest of the agencies that is their concern".
He then called on the Nigerian youth to distance themselves from engaging in this kind of violence, as the snatching of national resources this way is destructive, and it could jeopardize their future.
He therefore called on them to stay away from destructive friends who incite others to such behavior.

US Racial Injustice Protests Mount
Protesters have taken to the streets of several U.S. cities to bring attention to racial injustice.
Protests in Portland, Oregon, have been going in for two months, since the May 25 death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal officers to Portland, adding additional fuel to the protests.
The demonstrators now are also protesting the federal presence in the city.
In Seattle, police using flash bangs and tear gas arrested 45 people Saturday after demonstrations in support or the protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
Saturday night, in Austin, Texas, a man was killed when someone shot into a Black Lives Matter march.
Media accounts say the man may have approached a vehicle with a rifle before he was fired upon.
"All I know is that someone dying while protesting is horrible," Mayor Steve Adler of Austin said in a statement.
Adler said he is "heartbroken and stunned."
In Louisville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters called for justice of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who died in Louisville when police entered her home without warning on a "no knock" warrant and shot her.

US reportedly ramps up pressure on Nord Stream 2 contractors - RT Business News
The US government has made further attempts to force European firms to ditch the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Welt am Sonntag reported, citing people familiar with talks on the issue.
According to the newspaper, officials from US Department of State, the Treasury Department, as well as the Department of Energy approached European contractors to make sure they fully understand the consequences of staying in the project.
Up to a dozen officials reportedly held at least two online conferences with representatives of the firms in recent days.
Speaking in a "friendly" manner, the US side stressed that it wanted to prevent completion of Nord Stream 2, observers of the online talks said.
"I believe the threat is very, very serious," one of them revealed to the German outlet.
Those threats are consistent with comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, in which he warned that companies involved in the project had better "get out now" or risk facing penalties under Section 232 of the notorious Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
Apart from Russia's energy major Gazprom, which is developing the project, five European companies have joined.
Those are France's Engie, Austria's OMV, the UK-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Germany's Uniper.
Speaking to Welt am Sonntag, the latter called US attempts to undermine the "important infrastructure project" a clear intervention into European sovereignty.
Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, meant to expand US sanctions on companies involved in installing Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the sponsors of the bill, the measures can target companies facilitating or providing vessels, insurance, port facilities, or tethering services for those vessels, as well as to those providing certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European businesses and government officials have repeatedly decried US attempts to meddle in European energy policy by sanctioning Nord Stream 2, with some even calling on Brussels to work on countermeasures.
Moscow has also lambasted Washington's move, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia will develop a new strategy for completion of the project if Washington proceeds with new punitive measures.

Magu denies theft allegations of 329 billion naira from NNPC - Tit for tat.
The suspended EFCC chairman, Ibrahim Magu, has denied new allegations that he diverted N329 billion stolen from NNPC.
His lawyer, Wahab Shittu, said that after Magu recovered the money from the major oil dealers, he returned it to the NNPC account.
Wahab Shittu said after Magu returned the money, even the receipt of the recovered NNPC money was given to NNPC.
The truth is that the gossip saying that Magu suppressed the 329 billion naira from NNPC that he recovered from major oil dealers is nonsense.
Magu recovered the money and returned it to the NNPC account through "remita", and even gave him a receipt for the receipt of the money.
The NNPC has asked the EFCC to recover its funds from major oil dealers.
It was recovered and the money was returned to the NNPC account.
Even the receipt was there as evidence.
So how can it be said that Magu suppressed funds that did not go to anyone else's account, except directly to the NNPC account?
He then said that Magu would no longer stand by and endure false allegations, lies and slander against him.
He will respond to any allegation against him.
Whoever strikes him, he will strike back with vehemence.
Earlier in the week, Magu challenged Malami to come up with a single piece of evidence that he accepted a bribe.
Last week, Malami announced that Magu had been suspended on the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari.
While Magu denies the allegations, he also opened up, exposing allegations of corruption against Malami.

Hunger organization pushes out Yoho after Capitol incident
WASHINGTON (AP) - A nonpartisan Christian organization that seeks to end hunger said Saturday it asked for and received the resignation of Rep. Ted Yoho from its board of directors following what it called his "verbal attack" on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Yoho, R-Fla., of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last Monday on the steps of the Capitol.
Yoho maintained he did not use the words cited, though a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed the language as she described it.
In a statement, Bread for the World said its board met Friday with Yoho and sought his resignation "as an action that reaffirms our commitment to coming alongside women and people of color, nationally and globally, as they continue to lead us to a more racially inclusive and equitable world."
On its website, Bread for the World says its "collective Christian voice" lobbies Congress and the administration on ending hunger nationally and worldwide.
"As a bipartisan Christian organization committed to alleviating hunger and poverty through sound public policies, Bread for the World upholds the values of respect, dignity, and compassion that Jesus calls us to when engaging decision makers from across the political spectrum," the statement said.
"We believe that Rep. Ted Yoho's recent actions and words as reported in the media are not reflective of the ethical standards expected of members of our Board of Directors."
A spokesman for Yoho did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
In an extraordinary speech Thursday in the House, Ocasio-Cortez offered a dramatic account of the incident and broadened her remarks to assail what she called a sexist culture of "accepting violence and violent language against women."
More than a dozen colleagues joined her in casting the incident as all-too-common male behavior.
Yoho has described the encounter as a brief policy discussion and said that "no one was accosted, bullied, or attacked."
He expressed regret for his "abrupt manner."
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a freshman progressive who has gained praise and criticism for her outspokenness.
Yoho, 65, one of the most conservative members of the House, is retiring at the end of his fourth term.

China International Import Expo (CIIE) Demonstrates China's Strength in Implementing Development Policy.
Any follower of mass media communication will not miss seeing how the exhibition of goods that are being imported into China or the third China International Import Expo (CIIE) in the city of Shanghai are opened.
If we look at the speech of Chinese President Xi Jinping during the opening ceremony of the trade exhibition, we can see how he outlined new steps that his country will put into effect regarding opening up to the outside world in all areas of trade, in a step of "Run together and survive together ".
In addition to opening up, there are other important resolutions for development whose implementation Chinese authorities outlined, including continuing the improvement of the country's foreign investment environment, the international services trade, and the development of the economy through modern web technologies, extensive changes, innovation in trade and investment, and free market trading, etc.
If we look closely, this does not go to the CIIE exhibition, it will provide an opportunity to assure the whole world that China's economic development policies will not change.
And the mounting challenges that China as well as other parts of the world are facing together in the fight against COVID-19 will not cause China to put the brakes on its development plans.
In fact, we have seen how this year's exposition attracted more participants from companies, industries, "business people and government representatives, including from Africa, who have praised China's efforts to embrace the international community in its efforts to achieve success together.
To summarize, we can say that China's success in curbing COVID-19, its efforts to ensure domestic economic growth, its energetic efforts to open more doors to the outside world, and the carrying out of the CIIE exhibition during this time of serious challenge facing the world is an indication confirming its strength to continue to implement its development goals as planned.
Dogara met with Buhari after his return to APC.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives in Nigeria, Yakubu Dogara, has returned to the ruling APC party during a meeting with President Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja.
The Governor of Yobe State and Acting Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Board of Trustees, Mai Mala Buni, confirmed the defection during a press conference in Abuja.
Buni said Nigerians should not be surprised by the defection because the former leader of the House of Representatives is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and has now dealt with the reason that he left the party in the past.
On January 29, 2019, Dogara officially announced his defection to the PDP.
After returning to the PDP, Dogara won a re-election bid for the House of Representatives, where he was re-elected by the people of Bogoro, Dassa and Tafabalewa constituencies in Bauchi State.
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "Watch this space"
Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson dealt a blow to fans ahead of the close-season by revealing star attacker Wilf Zaha wants to leave the club.
The Ivorian international has been at Selhurst Park for over five years and now looks set to depart, having previously been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
At age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him, particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport, after a campaign in which Zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a Palace side which failed to inspire.
Speaking post-match after the final day, Hodgson told TalkSport's Alex Crook to "watch this space" regarding Zaha's probable exit after acknowledging the forward has "made it clear" he sees his future away from the club.
The forward still has three years left on his current Palace deal and they last year suggested it would take £100m to prise him away from the club.
Hodgson's side wrapped up the campaign with seven straight defeats and a final-day draw, dropping to 14th place in the process.
Zaha himself netted just once between mid-December and the end of the season, a long-range strike in a defeat to Chelsea.
He was reported to have handed in a transfer request last summer in a bid to force a move away, but a bid didn't materialise to tempt Palace to sell.
In an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure, Zaha changed agents in January and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away.
Zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the Premier League this season for Palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1,100 minutes or more, pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the No 11.
Malaysia searches for 24 Rohingya feared drowned off island
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysian authorities said Sunday that they were searching for two dozen Rohingya refugees who are feared to have drowned after jumping off their boat off the northern resort island of Langkawi.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, said initial police information showed that only one of 25 Rohingya men who jumped off the boat had managed to swim ashore.
The lone survivor sought help from police late Saturday and has been detained for further investigation, Zawawi said.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to a military crackdown, and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslim-dominated Malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad.
Zawawi said two vessels and an aircraft were deployed in the search.
He said the agency will also alert local fishermen and authorities in neighboring Thailand to assist in the search.
He didn't provide further details on the boat.
Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat off Langkawi that they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldn't be turned back to sea.
The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency later said that the 269 were transferred from a larger vessel on which dozens of people were believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia cannot accept any more Rohingya refugees as it struggles with an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said those already in the country will not be sent back out to sea.
Malaysia is home to over 2 million illegal immigrants as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers - including 101,000 Rohingya - who are registered with the U.N. refugee agency.

President Trump's administration will send two top officials to the Middle East this week, with the aim of strengthening a historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, to establish diplomatic relations.
Three diplomats say US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo together with President Donald Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, plan to visit at various times and in various countries in the region during the next few days, in order to encourage the re-establishment of relations between the Empire and Israel.
Pompeo is expected to fly on Sunday to Israel, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Sudan, according to diplomats who asked not to be named because the travel schedule has not been finalized or announced.
Kushner, meanwhile, will fly this weekend to Israel, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.
Their visit is expected to lead to the announcement of a reaching a position according to diplomats, although they all have at least one goal, to settle the terms of the agreement with Israel in the near future.
Pompeo is also scheduled to hold talks with the Taliban group in Qatar on issues relating to peace talks, which will be a key step in withdrawing the remaining US troops from Afghanistan.
The White House and the State Department have not commented on visits that would not be part of the US government's efforts to encourage ties between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, even though it did not achieve reconciliation in struggles between Israel and Palestine.
Buhari, El-Rufai Urged To Resign.

71 primary and secondary school teachers were expelled from the school for State Security Services agency.
At least 71 primary and secondary school teachers have been fired unexpectedly at the Community Staff School, owned by SSS officers in Abuja.
Their dismissal followed their cries for improved welfare, but when they came out to show their concern, they were dispersed by firing shots in the air to intimidate them.
The dismissal letter distributed to each teacher on November 2, landed on desk of the PREMIUM TIMES.
Initially before they were dismissed, the parents of the students were instructed that each child stay at home for two weeks, so that the school could make renovations.
But what followed this was the announcement of the dismissal of all teachers, from the primary school headmaster to the rest of the teachers.
At the secondary school as well all the staff were dismissed, from the principal of the school to the laboratory worker.
The Director General of the SSS ordered me to announce their dismissal from work.
This is due to the economic crisis caused by the corona pandemic.
The notice instructed anyone who has anything belonging to the school in his possession to immediately return it to the school board.
Teachers have long been struggling with the lack of care for their welfare.
Parents also complained that despite the situation, school fees had been increased from N70,000 to N90,000.
Teachers say they suffered salary cuts and other rights have been violated.
The Nigerian government says the "Madagascar mixture" does not cure coronavirus.
The Nigerian government says there is no indication that a mixture imported from Madagascar will cure coronavirus infection as claimed.
The announcement was made by the country's Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, who said that the country's medical research center had released its research report, in which it stated that Madagascar medicine contains ingredients that can reduce the frequency of cough but it is not a cure for Covid 19 disease.
Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina launched the mixture in April, claiming it cures coronavirus.
The World Health Organization has warned against taking the medicine that Madagascar produces without medical supervision.
Madagascar, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, has given African countries the drug, which it says cures coronavirus.
Earlier this month, Madagascar re-imposed traffic restrictions in the Analamanga region due to an increase in coronavirus infections.
It has also opened more clinics to treat the disease that continues to spread in parts of the world.

Poland to withdraw from European treaty aimed at preventing violence towards women
Poland's right-wing government says it will withdraw from a European treaty aimed at preventing violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the world's first binding instrument to prevent violence against women but the Polish Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, described the text as "harmful" because it requires that schools teach children about gender from a sociological point of view.
Ziobro said over the weekend that on Monday he will begin preparing the formal process to withdraw from the treaty.
"This ideological element is linked to the imperative to change education in schools and outside of school programs, in terms of learning, attitudes, convictions of the young Polish generation of students to make, in our opinion, the false assumption that biological sex is archaic, and in fact everything comes down to the socio-cultural gender."
In Ziobro's opinion, the convention's articles concerning the education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the LGBT context are not acceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT element of promoting family relationships, a view propagated by activists from left-wing or homosexual circles who want to translate their beliefs into binding law," he said.
The Council of Europe said on Sunday it is "alarmed" that Poland is aiming to withdraw from the Convention.
In Warsaw on Friday, around 2,000 people including women's groups and other rights activists held a demonstration in front of the offices of Ordo Luris, a right-wing organisation that supports withdrawal from the convention.
"We will not be victims" they chanted.
Demonstrations were also held in other Polish cities.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention for the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.

How Nigeria can revitalize the education system.
Former President Olusegun Obasanjo says there are currently more than 14 million young children roaming about aimlessly, not going to school.
He said this limited their access to education.
He also said that the education system in the country would never be reformed until the youth were in charge of education in this country.
Obasanjo made the remarks in Lagos, while addressing the graduation ceremony of "Teach for Nigeria Fellows".
It is an organization that helps to improve the education of at least 9,660 students in 80 schools in Lagos, Ogun and Kaduna states.
161 students graduated on this occasion.
The organization focuses on the further development of education, while some community leaders focus on implementation and management.
Obasanjo said, "These millions of children have been denied access to the education which will make it possible for them to use their skills and experience in order that the community can benefit from them, and they can benefit the community as well."
Evidence shows that if education is to be reformed in this country, then the youth have to take charge of the education sector.
Not only in the field of education, Obasanjo said young people must take the lead in many areas and sectors of society, then it will be possible to get out from the barrier of the challenges faced by education and other sectors in this country.
As for this organization, their students have successfully participated in various competitions and they are winning.
"I recently learned that students of "Teach For Nigeria Fellows", came second in the National Lafarge Competition and have obtained access to schools in the future".
Obasanjo advised them to focus on teaching students innovation skills to enhance their knowledge and quality.
He also called on them to be good representatives and ambassadors for positive change, freedom and justice in Nigeria.
Obasanjo also commented on the impact of coronavirus in Africa.

Coman defeated his former club.
Sports pundits continue to pay tribute to the young Kinglsey Coman fromBayern Munich, who scored the winning goal against his former club PSG and gave his current club the chance to win in this year's Champions' League.
Coman spent almost 10 years at PSG, where he began since college, and the club trained its junior player until he even played four games for them at senior level.
Coman, a 24-year-old Frenchman, has attracted the attention of football pundits, with clubs releasing young players they have trained, and then sometime later the players become an annoyance to them.
Coman left PSG in 2014, moved to Juventus where he won the Serie A title twice, before returning to Germany, where his star increasingly shined especially at the end of this season.
In all, the player has won nine league cup titles, 2 at PSG, 2 at Juventus and 5 at his current club Bayern Munich.

Saudi Muslims begin Hajj 2020.
The number of people intending to do hajj this year is limited due Corona epidemic that is spreading around the world.
Only Saudis and foreigners from about 160 countries living in Saudi Arabia are performing the hajj this year.
In recent years, about 2.5 million Muslims have gathered in Mecca to perform the hajj, which is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims who can afford it are required to attend at least once in their lifetime.
The pilgrims will spend the night in Minna before proceeding to the ascent of Arfat on Thursday.
Coles ditches plastic toys for books in new collectibles campaign
"We've really listened, and it was a really key thing in formulating this program," Ms Ronson said.
"We don't think people will want to recycle the books - we think they'll want to keep them, but they can recycle them at home if they wish to."
Ms Ronson said the new campaign had been in the works long before the onset of COVID-19, and despite the pandemic, she believed the timing was "quite good" for a new campaign given the amount of time parents were spending with their children.
Analysts had been concerned shoppers were tiring of the constant collectibles campaigns from major supermarkets, but Ms Ronson said there was no sign of fatigue just yet.
"We're not seeing any of that so far, but we do constantly look out for it," she said.
"We analyse a lot of data, week to week, month to month, to make sure we're launching things that really resonate with the customer base."
Collectible campaigns such as Little Shop were primarily pioneered by Coles in Australia, with the first iteration launching in mid-2018, fuelling one of the supermarket's best-ever single-quarter sales results.
Woolworths has since followed suit with its Lion King Ooshies campaign, which also helped the supermarket supercharge its sales, and most recently, its eco-friendly Discovery Garden promotion, which offered customer free herbs and flowers to plant.
However, with UBS analysts predicting Australia's supermarket sector to have COVID-inflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year, the impact of Coles' new collectibles could be far more muted this time.
Ms Ronson said customers could expect more varied and diverse forms of collectibles campaigns into the future, with promotions such as Little Shop likely to appear less often.
"There's a lot of these collectible-type campaigns to look to around the world, and we're constantly drawing inspiration from overseas," she said.
"We should be doing those sorts of things to make sure we're constantly raising the bar with our own customer base."
Sultan Meets Governor El-Rufai.
About 24 hours after the former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi met with Governor Nasir El'rufai, His Highness the Sultan of Sokoto HRH Sa'id Abubakar III also visited the governor.
The Sultan arrived at the Sir Kashim Ibrahim Government House around 12:20 on Monday in a black SUV.
He was received by the Secretary to the State Government, Balarabe Abbas, the Chief of Staff Muhammad Sani Dattijo, and the Commissioner for Homeland Security, Samuel Aruwan.
Jafaru Sani Ibrahim, State Commissioner for Local Governments was also among those who welcomed the Emir.
It will be recalled that, last Sunday thousands of people welcomed the former Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II on his visit to the state government house.
According to the report, the Sultan paid a visit to Governor Nasiru El-rufa'i to discuss security in southern Kaduna.
The southern part of Kaduna has long been a hotbed of inter-ethnic violence.
How This Year's Hajj Began
The number of people who will be able to attend this year's Hajj has been reduced due to the spread of the coronavirus worldwide.
Instead of more than 2 million pilgrims making the annual pilgrimage from around the world, the country's authorities have limited this year's hajj to only 1,000 Saudi nationals and foreigners living in the country, people who have been assessed in recent weeks.
Pilgrims between the ages of 20 and 50 were tested for COVID-19 before entering Mecca, where they were required to isolate themselves for 2 weeks in their hotel rooms, before being able to perform the hajj.
Muslims all over the world come to perform Hajj in order to fulfill one of the pillars of Islam, which is that one is required to perform hajj at least once in one's life to this holiest place for followers of Islam.
After those who went for Hajj this year completed their pilgrimage, they were required to isolate themselves for a week to ensure that they did not contract the disease during Hajj.
Sachin Pilot Vs Ashok Gehlot; BJP Says State In Political Crisis; Congress Wants Floor Test
Ashok Gehlot said if necessary, Congress hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's home.
A day after leading a dharna at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said if necessary, the Congress MLAs will meet the President and hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's residence to settle the crisis in the state.
At a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Mr Gehlot indicated that the plan was to have a floor test to prove that the majority of Congress MLAs and allies are with him in the tussle for power.
"He said the government has the majority and wants to go to the assembly floor," a statement issued by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi after the CLP meeting said.
The CLP meeting was held at the hotel where the MLAs in the Gehlot camp are holed up for days.
"The chief minister asked us to remain prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If required, he said, we would go to meet the President and would also hold a dharna outside the prime minister's residence," a party leader said.
The Rajasthan Governor must call an assembly session to let the Congress prove its majority, party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said, alleging that the BJP's conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government was now clear.
"The country is ruled in accordance with the law and constitution.
Governments are formed and run based on people's mandate.
BJP's conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is clear.
This is an insult to 8 crore people of Rajasthan.
The governor must call assembly session so that the truth comes before the country," Mr Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told Congress MLAs on Saturday that he was ready to go to the President of India to make sure that what he calls a "BJP conspiracy" to stall a test of strength does not succeed.
Mr Gehlot, who protested for hours at Governor Kalraj Mishra's home on Friday to press for an assembly session, held meetings with Congress MLAs and his cabinet on Saturday, after which a fresh proposal was drawn up and passed by the cabinet.
Mr Mishra had last night asked Mr Gehlot to re-submit the request for an assembly session, citing six objections.
This proposal will be sent to the Governor soon.
Mr Gehlot has accused the Governor of delaying the session because he is "under pressure" to stall his government's test of strength.
As Mr Gehlot met with his cabinet, a BJP delegation led by Rajasthan BJP leader Satish Poonia and Leader of Opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria met the Governor to discuss the COVID-19 situation in the state.
China's Hosting of CIIE Is a Sign of her Aim to Share Its Opportunities with the World.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said that hosting the 3rd China Import and Export Exhibition (CIIE) is a sign of China's serious determination to share its market opportunities with the rest of the world, as well as to make contributions toward global economic recovery.
Xi, who delivered a speech at the opening of this year's exhibition, which was opened late on Wednesday via video, said that it is important to insist on the principle of advancing international affairs through dialogue, as well as the maintenance of a multilateral trading system under the direction of the World Trade Organization, so as to further the building of the global trade economy without closures.
Xi continued saying that China has introduced a policy of expanding interactions among domestic markets, as well as expanding interactions among international markets, in order to meet domestic needs, as well as the interests of the international community.
Xi added that China has a very large population of 1.4 billion, within which the number of people who receive an income of up to about 5,000 Chinese yuan per month reaches 400 million, which makes China about the world's largest market, and it is even projected that in the next ten years, the sum total of imports into the country will reach 22 trillion US dollars.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced new steps to be put into effect by his country in opening up in all fields.
The president made these remarks in his speech at the opening ceremony of the 3rd international China Import and Export Exhibition (CIIE) in the city of Shanghai.
The president said his country would introduce a series of commodities that it will suspend in the field of international trade services, and it will expand other sectors, such as economic development through the use of modern web technologies, and deepen transformation, innovation in trade and investment, free trade, and creating a conducive trade environment.
Furthermore, according to President Xi Jinping, China will reduce the number of technologies that are banned or restricted as imports, so as to create a favorable environment for the exchange of modern technology between nations.
In addition, China will continue to improve its legal system, so that it is in line with international standards in terms of opening up, transparency, and strengthening protection of intellectual property rights, as well as the interests of foreign investors and providing legal protection for them.
He said China is ready to sign free trade agreements for development with the rest of the world.
COVID-19 Testing Expanded in Senegal
Senegal is expanding its coronavirus testing to give travelers the opportunity to be tested before leaving the country, as well as those arriving in the West African country, according to Reuters.
Senegal, whose economy relies on tourism to generate about 4 percent of the income from the country's goods and services each year, says 9,422 people have been infected with COVID-19 since the outbreak and 182 people have died.
Nearly 1.7 million people went on holiday in Senegal in 2019.
The country lifted the ban on international flights from July 15 but said it would ban those of countries who barred Senegalese nationals from entering their countries.
The Ministry of Health has established 4 COVID-19 testing centers in the capital Dakar to test travelers, of which at the time of the outbreak there was only one.
The country also plans to expand its testing sites in other major cities.
The court adjourned the hearing of Abba Kabir's case against Ganduje for allegedly selling government assets.
The Kano State High Court has adjourned the hearing of a case filed by Kano State governorship candidate Abba Kabir Yusuf which challenges Kano State Governor Abdullaji Umar Ganduje's sale of some government assets.
Yusuf Nadabo Isam'il's representative reported that during today's hearing, Judge Nura Sagir adjourned the case to October 29 this year.
Abba Kabir Yusuf's lawyer, Bashir Yusuf Tudun Wuzirici, said the decision taken by the Kano State governor to sell government assets was against the Kano State Land Management Act.
Barrista Musa Abdullahi Lawal, a lawyer for the state commissioner of justice, said the complaint was baseless and certainly not supportable.
.We are discussing solutions to the security crisis in Mali - ECOWAS - Freedom Radio Nigeria
Leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have said that on Monday next week they plan continue to discuss measures to end escalating violence in Mali.
Senior media adviser to the president, Femi Adesina, told reporters on Friday yesterday.

Adesina said in a statement he released, that Monday's leaders' summit was very important.
Because they will come up with steps that will help them bring an end to the persistent problems.
In the same statement, ECOWAS President and Nigerien President Muhammadou Issoufou said the coalition would do everything possible to impose steps that will bring peace to the whole of Mali.
Stomach bloating: Tips to reduce pain include taking anise
The link to depression is not coincidental.
People living with IBS, a disorder characterised by abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhoea, frequently suffer from anxiety and depression, which can worsen symptoms, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA).
"That's because the colon is in part controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress," explains the ADAA.
If your bloating still persists, it could be a sign of a food intolerance.
Corona: More than 16 million people are infected.
The United States still leads in numbers of Corona deaths, with more than 146,000, followed by Brazil with more than 86,000 deaths and Britain with nearly 46,000.
Africa is one of the worst-hit regions in the world with a total of 17,513 deaths.
Correspondents says that many countries do not carry out the test as they should, while some only test those whose illness is severe.
Serbia seeks more warplanes amid Balkan tensions
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its armed forces and is seeking to purchase more warplanes amid simmering tensions in the Balkans, the Serbian president said Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said "certain initiatives" have been made to buy a fleet of fighter-bombers, accusing the U.S. and other Western countries of arming Serbia's NATO neighbors and its breakaway former province of Kosovo.
"The Americans, Turks and Germans are taking care of their beloved child," Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said the U.S. has recently delivered a number of armored vehicles to Kosovo's security forces.
During a tour of a Serbian army tank brigade, Vucic said his country cannot compete with "NATO donations" to its neighbors when it comes to weapons, "therefore we must do it alone."
Vucic did not specify what type of warplanes Serbia plans to buy, but the pro-government media said his government has officially asked the U.S. for the delivery of 20 fighter-bombers.
The reports said Washington has not yet responded to Belgrade's request and that in case of a refusal, it is likely to purchase Russian-made Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft.
Serbia, which claims military neutrality, has recently received a sophisticated anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.
Another Serbian ally, China, has delivered military drones.
U.S. officials have in the past spoken openly about introducing sanctions against Serbia if Moscow sends more arms to the country, especially those that could jeopardize the security of neighboring NATO-member states.
The Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia is being watched with unease in the West and among Serbia's neighbors.
Tensions are growing in the Balkans, which went through a devastating civil war in the 1990s.
NATO intervened in Serbia to stop a bloody Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists in 1999.
Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia's populist leadership has further strengthened close political and military ties with the Kremlin, as well as Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, don't accept Kosovo's independence, which is recognized by the U.S. and most of the West.
History focus can play an important role in reconciliation
Divides have deepened when understanding and healing should be our goals.
Our school system is partly to blame for this failure of knowledge and understanding.
Far too little Australian history is taught.
In fact, without radical action, the only school subject that focuses specifically on our history - "Australian history," at year 12 - will die within the next five years, maybe sooner.
Last year, of 49,324 Victorian students to complete the VCE, only 628, or 1 per cent, did Australian history.
Over the past six years, this figure has been almost halved, with almost 100 fewer students enrolling every year.
A key reason why so few students choose to study Australian history in year 12 is that little has been done in earlier years to fire their passion.
History is not even a standalone learning area, but is subsumed within the broader "humanities."
So across years 7 and 8, students complete only one short unit on ancient "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture."
Then, in years 9 and 10, there is another unit focusing on Australia during the world wars.
For many Victorian students, that is the sum of Australian history taught across their secondary years.
At years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit covering the period from 1750-1918.
Three actions should urgently be taken to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become a standalone learning area like English, maths and science.
Because history is taught only as part of the humanities, it is given little space within the curriculum.
It is also normally taught by humanities generalists who have not studied history themselves.
Historical skills, such as the analysis of evidence, are complex.
We must recruit more specialist history teachers to make sure these are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the study of Australian history from 1788 to 1914 must become compulsory.
Students love familiarity.
So many of my former students decided against Australian history in year 12 because they would have had to learn the content from scratch.
Knowledge of our history alone will not bridge our deep racial divides.
But without it, as the Victorian curriculum makes clear, the task is hopeless.

Attackers have released the wife of a vigilante commander, a woman they were holding hostage in Jigawa.
The attackers who were holding the wife of vigilante chief Abdullahi Suleiman hostage released her on Monday night.
Sources told PREMIUMTIMES that the Husna, the 50 year-old-wife of Suleiman was released after an indemnity of N2 million was paid.
However, the state police spokesman Audu Jinjiri, did not confirm whether ransom has been paid, but said that the attackers released Husna at 10 PM on Monday night.
Later on Tuesday, a close relative of Suleiman's family told PREMIUM TIMES that the gunmen demanded a ransom of 50 million naira, but later agreed to accept 2 million naira.
He said the gunmen held Husna and other hostages in Ringim Forest.
Husna is at home with her family in good health.
SECONDARY TEST: Nigeria will use GCE results instead of WASSCE in 2020.
The federal government has said it may ask students to sit for the GCE exam in November, if preparations for the West African WASSCE exam were not completed by the deadline.
The GCE is a separate exam which is written in November and the results are released in December.
The Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajuiba, made the announcement at a bi-weekly press conference on the situation of coronavirus in the country.
The minister said the change was necessary as there was no reason to extend the deadline for writing the WASSCE exam.
PREMIUM TIMES reports that the federal government has announced a cancellation of students' return to school, after it had already set a date for resumption.
And also said no secondary school in Nigeria would reopen so that students would sit for the WASSCE exam between August 5 and September 5.
This step was taken to avoid the possibility of Coronavirus infection for students due to overcrowding in test rooms.
And also Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Gambia are also trying to resolve the possibility of postponing the exam.
The minister said the continued spread of coronavirus in the country meant that states were not yet ready to send students back to school.
Longtime staffer of Rep. Vern Buchanan dies of coronavirus
"Gary was the consummate professional and a true public servant in every sense of the word," Buchanan said on Facebook.
"He touched so many lives and was loved and respected by those who knew him.
I will never forget his uplifting spirit, sense of humor and sheer joy at helping others."
Rep. Buchanan's office had tweeted a statement earlier this month that Tibbetts did not have any recent interactions with anyone else in the office.
Tibbetts, a field representative, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the start of the pandemic, above New York's 411,200, according to state health agencies.
The number of hospitalizations has increased by 79% since the Fourth of July, data from the state's health care administration shows.
At least 50 hospital intensive care units in Florida have reached capacity on Saturday, the agency's data shows.
"We've advised that's something that could make an impact," DeSantis said in June.
"At the same time, to do police and put criminal penalties on that is something that probably would backfire."
JIGAWA: Hisbah commission destroyed 588 bottles of beer in Ringim.
The commission responsible for prevention of crimes against Islamic law (Hisbah) has announced the seizure and destruction of 588 bottles of beer in Ringim Local Government Area of ​​Jigawa State.
The commander of the Commission, Ibrahim Dahiru, made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria on Sunday in Dutse.
Dahiru said the commission destroyed the bottles of beer on August 29.
He said they seized the bottles of beer from the villages of Tudun Babaye, Gujungu, Kijawal and Wadugur in Ringim Local Government Area.
Dahiru explained that Islam forbids the consumption of beer and all other substances causing drunkenness and intoxication in the cities and villages of the state.
He said the commission would continue to arrest and deter those who carry out evil deeds such as this in the community.
It will be recalled that in September, 2019, the Hisbah Commission seized and destroyed 196,400 bottles of beer in Kano.
The liquor bottles were destroyed in Kalemawa Forest, Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area, where Governor Abdullahi Ganduje explained that alcohol and other intoxicants which can harm the human brain are prohibited by Islam.
Our Islamic scholars and our leaders must collaborate to fight against this problem, to do away with any drink that intoxicates.
Ganduje said.
Home form vital for Jose Mourinho as boss says it will be easier for Tottenham when fans return to stadiums
Jose Mourinho has helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the Premier League's restart, but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back.
Spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term, but were beaten four times - only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil.
The Portuguese coach says it's possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent, but would be easier with them present.
"We need to do it with the fans. Without them you can create a kind of fortress, but based on the tactical side of the game," he said.
"But, I think with fans, you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you."
Mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at Chelsea, or which Liverpool have built over the past three seasons, is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger.
But it's also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season, particularly in close-fought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference.
"I think the Premier League is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams."
"But to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important."
"I think our recent results at home without the fans are important, but we need them back.
I can imagine that victory against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.
This is the kind of empathy that you can create step by step."
Two of Our Officers Killed, we arrested 47 people - DSS.
At least two people have reportedly lost their lives among officers of the Security Services (DSS), following clashes that broke out between security forces and members of the IPOB.
The rebels claimed that they too lost 21 people, after which security forces arrested 47 youth of the IPOB, the association advocating for the actualization of Biafra.
The Premium Times said the incident had left people very nervous after soldiers and police were dispatched to the area where the violent clash broke out.
Some eyewitnesses told reporters that security forces continued to search all the nooks and crannies of the area in the pursuit of IPOB members.
The spokesman for the Nigerian Department of Security Services (DSS), Mr. Peter Afunanya said their people were attacked in Emene, Enugu State.
Peter Afunanya blamed the IPOB for the attack, which resulted in the loss of two staff of the Directorate.
Afunaya said they were provoked for no reason.
Ministers of Southern Nigerian have called for an investigation into alleged killings in Lekki.
Nigerian ministers from the southwest region have called for an investigation into allegations that soldiers shot at Lekki Road during protests against alleged abuse inflicted by police officers.
Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola made the announcement on behalf of ministers from the region after a meeting at the presidential palace.
Fashola said that after the ministers visited their respective constituencies in response to the president's request for them to meet with the public, they agreed to the need for an investigation to tell the public the truth about the incident.
He said they needed to strengthen the police force and society by seeing that they discharge their responsibility to protect the health and property of the public by taking care of their own health and providing them with modern equipment.
Ministers from the region include Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, Olamilekan Adegbite, Sunday Dare, Omotayo Alasoadura and Adeleke Mamora.
Judges Who Were Kidnapped in Zamfara Have Been Released.
Two months after some judges in Zamfara State were kidnapped, the kidnappers released the two abducted shari'a court judges.
This happened two months after they were kidnapped on their way back from Maradi in Niger Republic.
Reports say that a ransom of one million naira was paid for each one of them before the judges were released. The judges are Salihu Abdullahi and Shafi'u Jangebe.
They had been requested to pay ten million naira each, but that was not possible.
But after that, the gunmen called their relatives and asked them to pay whatever they could afford to pay.
Buhari meets with leaders of African countries online.
President Muhammadu Buhari has followed in the footsteps of his counterparts, West African leaders, in holding on-line talks regarding how to resolve the political crisis that has hobbled Mali.
Today, Monday, the country heads resumed talks in the Malian capital, Bamako, together with the parties of the conflict to bring reconciliation on the issues which began on Thursday last week.
It may be recalled that since last Thursday an agreement was reached with the intention of resuming talks today, Monday.
Since Thursday, Presiden Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger, who is also president of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said there is a need for all the country's parties to do everything possible to end the crisis battering the country.
West African leaders included President Muhammadu Buhari, President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita of Mali, and President Machy Sall of Senegal.
The rest are, Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana and President Alassane Ouattara of Cote d'Ivoire who also visited Mali to discuss the political crisis that batters the country, while representatives of violence groups and local groups have stated their positions regarding the crisis.
Earlier, the former president of this country, Goodluck Jonathan, who is also the chairman of Mali's committee for reconciliation, visited the country two weeks ago and called on protesters to stop and together promise to reach a settlement.
Aswan villagers collect, guard and return crashed chocolate shipment to Sudan
A truck loaded with tons of chocolate headed to Sudan rolled over on the Aswan-Abu Simple International Road on Sunday, in front of Wadi Karkar Village entrance, with the driver falling into a coma brought on by heatstroke.
Villagers rushed to the scene to attend to the fallen driver and retrieve the fallen shipments.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, explained his view that the driver was "a passerby in front of our village; we could not leave him alone.
We should help anyone, whatever their identity, if they are in distress."
He added that the villagers brought an ambulance to retrieve the driver, and then attempted to retrieve the truck's goods, estimated to be worth three million LE.
According to Bahr, the villagers stayed at the scene from morning to night retrieving as many shipments as they could.
"The most important thing for us was to save the driver's life, protect the shipment, and open up the international road," he explained.
The villagers were more than ready to bring water and shelter the injured driver, Bahr said, adding that all they wanted was to ensure that he would enter and leave the village safely.

Hurricane Hanna: Coronavirus-hit Texas faces new threat of catastrophic flooding in 'double whammy'
Forecasters are predicting "catastrophic flooding" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna made landfall twice, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 90mph.
It came ashore on Saturday as a category one storm (the lowest of the five levels) and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm - but there could still be 15-30cm (6-12in) of rain on Sunday with 60mph winds.
Some areas have already reported getting up to 23cm (9in) of rainfall, including Cameron County, which borders Mexico.
Hanna was the opening hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic cyclone season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield warned residents to stay alert, saying: "We're not even close to over at this point.  We're still expecting catastrophic flooding."
Texas has already been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.
Governor Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in the storm's path, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.
He said: "Any hurricane is an enormous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and made even more severe, seeing that it's sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19."
The first landfall happened at 5pm on Saturday, 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second took place nearby in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without power on Saturday evening.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi have placed barricades near intersections so they are ready to use if streets flood.
In a tweet, President Donald Trump said his administration was monitoring Hanna, along with Hurricane Douglas, which was heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
Resident Sherry Boehme, who lives along a beach in Corpus Christi, said the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt during the pandemic.
The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease.
She said: "It's almost like a double whammy to us.
I think it's made a lot of people nervous.
"We'll get through it.
Everybody is good and strong and sticks together."
Tree Branches Downed as Hurricane Hanna Passes Through Southern Texas
Hurricane Hanna weakened to a tropical storm after it made landfall on the coast of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but officials warned the storm still had potential to lead to "life-threatening" flash flooding.
The National Weather Service (NWS) said heavy rainfall remained the greatest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this footage on Twitter, and told Storyful he filmed this footage outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever'
Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever' after defying Boris Johnson's call for them to get back into the office
Union chiefs were last night accused of wanting staff to "stay at home forever" after defying Boris Johnson's clarion call for workers to get back to the office.
Tory MPs reacted with anger after the Public and Commercial Services Union told their members to challenge bosses who ordered them back to their desks.
Former Minister Andrew Percy said it was "unacceptable" that vital public-sector work such as issuing passports was going undone while private employees had toiled to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis.
"It's unacceptable for them to refuse to come back to work while people in distribution centres and factories around the country have continued to go to work to feed civil servants during this period," he said.
"Many of those workers would now like a holiday and can't have one because of this refusal to go back to work in offices which can be achieved safely.
"The union chiefs cannot have a policy of stay at home forever - especially not now that we know people can return to work safely."
Following the Prime Minister's call, Alex Chisholm, the Civil Service's new chief operating officer, last week told all ministries that it was time to "change the default that civil servants should work from home and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1."
But the Public and Commercial Services Union told its 200,000 members they did not have to accept that guidance, claiming it was a political issue.
A spokesman for the PCS, Britain's largest civil service union, said the back-to-the-office demand "is not based on our members" health and safety, or on helping our economy.
It is based entirely on political pressure being exerted by some Tory MPs who are demanding that the Civil Service is used as an example to get everybody back to work.
"Our advice to members is clear: if you are working from home and you get approached by anyone in your department asking you to now go back to work, don't just accept that's what you have to do."
The dispute comes amid growing concerns over delays to passports caused by home-working, with more than 400,000 people now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.
The Home Office has now said it will "seek to expedite" applications from Britons due to travel within the next 14 days and who have been waiting on the Passport Office for more than four weeks.
The PCS has admitted that some people are having to wait for as long as 143 days for passports but insists that "small and often cramped offices" make social distancing difficult for the Passport Office's 4,000 staff.
Former Cabinet Minister David Davis urged civil service union chiefs to "behave responsibly" and work with the Government to find way of getting people back to their workplaces.
He added that if he was in Government, he would be asking union leaders: "What are you suggesting? That you stay [at home] all summer?"
However, Mr Johnson's plea to get people back to their offices has also gone unheeded by some of Britain's top firms.
A study of big employers with a total of 400,000 staff between them found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to the workplace.
The Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs has again written a letter to the Inspector General of police and the Director General of the SSS on the killings of Muslims.
The National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has again written a letter to Inspector General of Police Muhammad Adamu and the Director General of the State Security Service (SSS) in connection with the alleged brutal killings of Muslims in South East and Southwest Nigeria.
The National Security Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), the largest body representing Muslims in the country, said it was necessary again to write the letter to the security chiefs, following reports that there were some deadly attacks on Muslims in the South West and South East.
In recent weeks there have been reports of attacks on Muslims in Southern Nigeria.
Pictures were posted in online newspapers showing Muslims being attacked, injured and their mosque set on fire in Orlu, Imo State.
Imo State Police Spokesperson, Ikeokwu Orlando, told PREMIUM TIMES that the police force should organize everything to ensure that every member of any ethnic group is protected in the state.
Last week, The Cable newspaper reported news of burning of two mosques in the city of Nsukka, Enugu State, following an altercation between a NAPEP driver and a woman whose relatives injured him in a scuffle that arose when she refused to pay him his full fare.
But Enugu police spokesman Daniel Ekea said he would not comment until he had confirmed how the incident occurred.
Letter of Concern.
In various letters sent by the NSCIA to the IGP and the SSS, and signed by the Deputy Secretary of the Council, Salisu Shehu, the council pointed out that this kind of mass murder and serial killing is very worrisome.
He called on security forces to protect the lives, property and mosques of Muslims in the South East and South West.
The letter also called for looking after those whose properties were damaged.
The letter also called on the security chiefs to stand up and curb threats against Muslims and their properties in the two regions.
China's Credit Extended to Nigeria Improves its Economic Growth - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, Nigeria's Vanguard newspaper published an editorial commentary entitled "Borrowed Money from China and Our Country's Independence", in which it explained that the Nigerian parliament has approved loan agreements with China, and the terms of the agreements comply with International guidelines.
Chinese loans to Nigeria have helped Nigeria in the areas of economic and structural development, certainly Nigeria has benefitted.
The editorial also stated that previously some Nigerians had alleged that certain provisions in the loan agreements had undermined Nigeria's sovereignty.
In fact, this allegation is baseless, the desire to disregard the power of "protection of the country's sovereignty" that Nigeria mentioned is a pledge to pay her debts, it does not affect the issue of national sovereignty, and does not undermine Nigeria's sovereignty at all.
China provides loans in accordance with the terms of international trade agreements.
China has provided US $3,121 million in loans to Nigeria, accounting for 3.94% of Nigeria's total national debt, and an annual interest rate of 2.5%. The loan will be repaid over a long time.
All loans provided by China to Nigeria have been used for infrastructure projects, such as the railway line between Abuja and Kaduna, the railway line inside Abuja, the railway line between Lagos and Ibadan, and motorways in Keffi, as well as preparations to upgrade the country's airports, and so on. These all have created jobs in Nigeria, and make a significant contribution to the economic development of Nigeria.
Congress Was Already Broken.  The Coronavirus Could Make It Worse.
"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis," says the report, which grew out of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership.
"But we are also facing another reckoning, one over our nation's original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding."
The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices.
It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.
If the idea of a remote Congress takes hold, the report suggests, it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction.
"Because of the pandemic, Congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually, and we certainly understand why," the report said.
"But as much as that may have been a necessity, it should not be interpreted as a virtue."
The document says Congress needs "more and not less in-person interaction among members of Congress.
They need to learn more about each other's districts, hold civil conversations aimed at finding common ground, build relationships of trust that can lead understanding and solutions."
In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true.
Soldiers in Nigeria Killed a Police Inspector by Beating Him - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
It has been discovered that soldiers guarding a company killed a police officer after he broke the rules for following the road in front of the company on Sunday, August 16,2020.
A relative of the police officer who spoke to PUNCH about the incident and also demanded anonymity, said: “My brother along with two police officers refused to follow the rules of the road as a result of a fence erected in front of the Eleme Petrochemical company. They were detained by a soldier, and a heated argument ensued which degenerated into a fight.
One of the soldiers, who was involved in the fighting, used a large board to hit my brother on the head, he fell down and stop moving instantly.
He was rushed to hospital to save his life.
After 24 hours in the hospital, he died.
So far no one from the police or the military has commented on the incident or taken action.
When contacted, the military spokesman in Fatakwal, Charles Ekeocha, said he had no information on the incident, but promised to release it as soon as he received it. But by the time of this writing, he has not said anything.
9 Nigerian soldiers lost their lives after their vehicle ran over a landmine in Maiduguri.
Reports from Nigeria say at least nine Nigerian soldiers have been killed as a result of their vehicle running over a landmine in the northeastern part of the country, the area struggling with the Boko Haram insurgency.
The French news agency revealed that the accident happened last Monday in Malam Fatori near the border of Niger, while the military vehicles were conveying food from Maiduguri.

FDNY diversity official says 'most definitely' OK to exclude white firefighter from color guard
An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.
White firefighter Lt. Daniel McWilliams filed a lawsuit claiming racial bias after he was removed from a flag-bearing unit at a November 2017 memorial mass honoring deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternal society of black firefighters.
And FDNY's chief diversity and inclusion officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, has defended the decision at a New York state Division of Human Rights trial, The New York Post reports.
McWilliams was one of the three FDNY firefighters seen in an iconic photo as they hoist the American flag at Ground Zero in the days after the 9/11 attacks.
According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.
Being a flag bearer at the event was an 'esteemed honor and privilege' for McWilliams, according to his lawsuit, CNN reported.
Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.
She then asked McWilliams - a 29-year FDNY veteran - to 'help in a different capacity.'
Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.
McWilliams claimed in his suit that he asked Wilson if she was removing him from the color guard because he's not black.
She confirmed that was the case, he said.
Wilson, a 21-year FDNY veteran who was also part of the 9/11 rescue efforts, apparently replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claimed he left the memorial 'to save himself from further shame, humiliation and embarrassment,' as their exchange was overheard by friends and colleagues, the New York Daily News reported.
During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'
'No, it isn't,' Loving said, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'
By way of explanation, Loving said that it was OK to swap out a white person for a black person to 'uplift our identities and our separate ethnicities in order to instill a sense of pride and community and support for one another.'
McWilliams first filed his racial bias complaint with the FDNY in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the FDNY, the city of New York and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
After filing his complaint, Sullivan said that McWilliams was retaliated against and intimidated by Wilson's supporters.
At one point, one of her supporters allegedly laid hands on McWilliams and said: 'I've heard about you, they told me you'd act this way, and now you know me.'
In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.
'If you're black and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you get a slap on the wrist at best,' Sullivan wrote.
Wilson, according to the lawsuit, received 'one hour of counseling' over her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a person of color receives 'heavy-handed discipline and punishment,' Sullivan wrote.
'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.

It is a rumor that I want to run for vice president - Dogara - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The Bauchi State Government is at the fore front in spreading the rumor, he said.
The former Speaker of the House of Representative in Nigeria, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara has disregarded social media lies and innuendos that he will run for vice president in the 2023 general election with APC National Leader Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
Dogara came out and declared that the Bauchi State government was instigating the spread of the rumors to tarnish his image.
According to him, he is now focusing more on factors that will move the country forward and seeking to overcome its existing problems, rather than the issue of seeking the position of Vice president under the present circumstances.
He says this is not the time for politics, let alone to begin talking this way about him.
According to Dogara, he initially intended to dismiss such allegations, but later realized that the proponents of these lies and rumors were determined to spread their propaganda, to the extent that some trustworthy media outlets are learning from them, and for this reason it is incumbent upon him to openly come out and warn the perpetrators of such rumors to desist.
In a statement given to his media officer, Turaki Hassan, Dogara told journalists that he advised the public to disregard these lies and rumors of praise singers, because as he said, "It's an act of capable of fueling quarrels".
He said, "These rumors and pictures being posted on social media are, in our understanding, the work of some of the Bauchi State government praise singers who want to force on the public the lie that I will run for the office of vice-president in the 2023 election, in order to push the insistence of their boss, who is frustrated with Dogara's departure from the PDP. They are attributing it to that insinuation".
Dogara's speech also considered that the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Muhammad, himself had been spreading the innuendo, and continued to promote this fable that he wants the people to be convinced of so that they tarnish Dogara's image, and in addition remove the attention of the people from his negligence in managing the affairs of Bauchi State as he should have.
In relation to his words about the lies of social media being baseless and without excuse, Dogara noted that the 2023 election year was a long way away, so it was not right in these circumstances to show intention to run for office, because it is time to face the challenges facing the country and resolve them.
Dogara said he was unaware that any political party was currently selling nomination forms for the 2023 presidential election, let alone that of the vice-presidential candidate, whom the presidential candidate appoints as his choice.
He continues with pride saying that, he Yakubu Dogara is now busy assisting with building and unifying all members of the APC in Bauchi State, and because of this he needs those who are exaggerating lies to allow him to do what is beneficial for the building of the nation.
Our correspondent explained that Yakubu Dogara has recently defected from the PDP and joined the APC, an issue that is increasingly the subject of conversations, especially in the politics of Bauchi State where it seems that noisy political disputes are escalating between Governor Bala Muhammad and Yakubu Dogara.
Hon. Dogara was one of those who stood firm in securing the victory of Senator Bala in the Bauchi governorship, and surprisingly within a short time they drew apart and started political bickering with each other.

Future of north Brisbane koala habitat site goes to planning court
The council said as well as being critical koala, squirrel glider and grey goshawk habitat, it was a key link between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek bushland corridors.
The property developers have appealed the council's rejection in the Planning and Environment Court, arguing the development complies with City Plan 2014 legislation, would satisfy an unmet town planning and community need and could "be undertaken without any unacceptable impacts."
Strong community opposition persists over the proposed development.
The developers, while maintaing the proposal is fully compliant with the plan, argue it could be changed to avoid any non-compliance rather than refused.
The development as it stands involves several stages, including a service station, childcare centre and 39 townhouses.
More than 120 public submissions were made during the consultation period, most objecting to the proposal as too big and inappropriate for the site.
BCC opposition leader Jared Cassidy said the council needed to buy the land to protect koalas.
"[Lord mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting ratepayer funds in a developer court battle and buy this land to protect Brisbane's wildlife," Cr Cassidy said.
"This is one of the most significant pieces of habitat in the Mountain to Mangroves Corridor and is home to a large koala community."
Cr Schrinner this week said the council wanted to see the koala habitat on the site protected.
"We didn't believe the proposal was appropriate for the site," Cr Schrinner said.
"This, I understand, is now going through a court process and obviously we hope to see out of that court process a good, positive outcome which will see the habitat preserved."
Cr Schrinner said koala habitat mapping was a joint responsibility between the council and the state government, with the state government responsible for detailed koala mapping used by local authorities for assessing development applications.

He said the increase in cost resulted in the total amount of the contract being increased to N105.041 billion.
He said the increase came as a result of their efforts to increase the number of works on the road as well as to expand its width and length, in addition to improving the quality of the road. All this resulted in increased contract costs.
The contract in question has been awarded since 2010.
1 in 3 parts of the project has been completed.
We are trying to finish the remainder of the second phase which we inherited from previous governments.
Minister Fashola added that the executive council had also approved an additional N9.348b to allow the completion of the work on the Lokko-Oweto Bridge, which connects Nasarawa and Benue states,
He added that the second phase of the project we are trying to complete is the Lokko-Oweto Bridge.
This contract was awarded in 2011 which we are currently working to finish.
Judge denies attempt to stop order requiring release of children in immigration custody
In a Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order can't be met.
But Gee also underscored in her order that ICE still has a duty to release children in a timely manner.
The three ways Gee had outlined included releasing families who are in ICE detention together, releasing children to a sponsor, or releasing families based upon a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of Proyecto Dilley, an organization that offers legal services to families in detention, decried the move as allowing ICE to decide whether to continue keeping children detained.
"The bottom line for me is that kids are detained indefinitely and they have no way out unless ICE agrees to do it or families agree to be separated," Fluharty said.
Families are detained in three facilities run by ICE -- Berks in Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.
Children at the facilities range from ages 1 to 17, according to lawyers and advocates who provide legal assistance.
Gee -- who oversees implementation of the Flores Agreement, which governs care of children in custody -- said in June that given "non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules," it was imperative to transfer children out of the facilities.
There are 969 detainees in ICE custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of July 23, according to ICE.
Of those, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes and one in Dilley, two of the family detention centers.
Overall, there have been more than 3,700 confirmed cases in custody
"You Do the Right Things, and Still You Get It"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and carpenter turned computer programmer for NASA, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, a retired Methodist Hospital nurse who calls herself a "glass half full person," ran an online fanzine and attended Comic Con events years ago.
They gather weekly with their two daughters, son-in-law and 7-year-old grandson for jigsaw puzzles and fierce games of Uno.
"They are amazing nerds," Ms. Roman, 38, said of her parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, understood the perils of the pandemic - she had diabetes, asthma and heart disease, which could put her at higher risk.
Her husband had chronic lung disease and a stent to open a blocked coronary artery.
"We have been so careful, so very careful, and stayed away from people," Ms. Roberts said.
Her husband began working from home in the spring when Washington State, New York and then other areas around the country were hit hard.
Mr. Roberts occasionally made a supermarket run during "senior" hour; the couple's only "big, hot date" in recent months, Ms. Roberts said, was to view wildflowers from their car.
Their younger daughter was diligent as well.
But then she came back from work sneezing one day in mid-June and thought it was allergies.
Soon she had a cough, fever, headaches and diarrhea, and lost her senses of taste and smell, telltale symptoms of the coronavirus.
"She told me, "I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I wore a mask, I wore gloves, I washed my hands,"" Ms. Roberts said.
"You do the right things, and still you get it."
Elaine Roberts, who tested positive for the coronavirus, did not become seriously ill.
But for her parents, it would be much worse.
Mr. Roberts and his wife started sneezing, then coughing, just like their daughter, and developed fevers and severe body aches.
Then he got "awfully sick, awfully quickly," Sheryl Roberts recalled.
He became confused on June 22.
Alarmed, she tested his oxygen level.
It was low, and she called her older daughter to take him to an emergency care center, the second visit in two days.
Gunmen abduct students sitting for exams in Kaduna.
Reports from Kaduna State, Nigeria, say gunmen attacked a school and abducted seven students as well as one female teacher and killed a man.
The source said that at about 8 A.M. yesterday, Monday, gunmen attacked Prince Academy in the village of Damba-Kasaya in Chikun Local Government Area of ​​Kaduna State, just as the 3rd grade students were about to begin their exams.
Nigerian newspapers have reported that the students are among those ordered by the Nigerian government to return to school to sit for the exams.
The newspapers named the teacher abducted by the gunmen as Christianah Madugu, while the man killed by the gunmen was identified as Benjamin Auta.
Akila Barde, a young man who told reporters how the incident took place, said the gunmen entered the village on motorcycles.
Records show that all students range in age from 12 years and upward and they include both boys and girls.
Reasons why the Kano state government recruited Qur'anic scholars into teaching initiative.
The Kano State Government has approved the recruitment of 60 Qur'anic scholars to teach Qur'anic students modern education in 15 reserved schools.
Kano State Governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje approved the move yesterday, Monday.
The approval follows a report from the Kano State Islamic Schools Board, headed by Education Commissioner Malam Muhammad Sunusi Kiru.
Governor Ganduje said his government had set up a committee to address the problem of street begging in Kano State, and had also set up schools to enable Qur'anic students to memorize Qur'an as well as promoting modern education in order to improve their lives.
It may be recalled that the government has provided schools in Bunkure, Madobi, Bagwai and 12 other local government areas of the 44 local government areas of Kano State.
Cameroon to Investigate $40 Million Spent on COVID-19.
Cameroonian authorities have ordered an investigation into how public funds donated to a special fund to fight COVID-19 in the country were managed.
The order comes after human rights groups put on pressure to conduct an investigation, alleging that $40 million donated in public funds and equipment had been embezzled.
Their complaint arose after the groups alleged that four thousand bags of rice had been sold, rice which had originally been provided as aid for victims of COVID-19.
However, authorities say sufficient medical testing equipment, soap, antiseptics, face masks, medicines as well as sufficient water have been procured across the country.
President Paul Biya had invested $1.8 million in grants in addition to that which individuals, companies, ministers and members of parliament have given.
Cameroon has also received foreign funding to fight COVID-19.
Government to tighten the ban on entry into Aso Rock Hospital.
The federal government will tighten measures to reduce the number of people admitted to Aso Rock Hospital.
The Permanent Secretary of the Presidency Tijjani Umar made the announcement on Thursday.
The government has taken these measures in order to improve the hospital services.
Umar said according to the system, the hospital should take care of the health of the president and his family, the vice president and his family as well as those who work in the presidential palace.
In 2015, the government allocated N3.94 billion to the hospital, followed by N3.87 billion in 2016.
In 2017, the government allocated 331.70 billion naira, and in 2018 the hospital received 1.03 billion naira.
In 2019, the hospital received N800 million.
That is why President Muhammadu Buhari has announced the government's plan to restore the honorable reputation the hospital had.
Servicom National Coordinator Nnennna Akajemeli explained that in addition to the financial crisis, the hospital was also suffering from a shortage of health workers, especially doctors, and a lack of electricity.
Investigations show that President Muhammadu Buhari and his family are among the people who should be receiving treatment at the hospital but they do not patronize it.

Seattle radio host who mocked Trump's reaction to protests now says he needs a gun after Starbucks below his apartment is trashed - RT USA News
Paul Gallant has a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump in June for saying anarchists were burning and pillaging Seattle.
All it took was for the mayhem to come near the talk show host's home.
"I feel like I need to buy a firearm because this is clearly going to keep happening," Gallant said Saturday night on Twitter after coming home to see the Starbucks coffeeshop below his apartment complex "destroyed" by vandals.
"Enough is enough.  It looks like a block party down the street from me.  Really angry right now."
The reaction stood in stark contrast to last month, when Trump complained that Seattle's mayor was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
"These liberal Dems don't have a clue," the president said.
"The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it's just wonderful, even the death."
Gallant, who co-hosts the 'Danny & Gallant'show on Seattle's ESPN radio affiliate, tweeted in response: "Walked through it last night out of curiosity and saw no burning, pillaging or deaths.  Chill dawg."
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building because explosives could be inside the damaged Starbucks.
He posted pictures of the damage, saying, "Great job a - holes," and noted that he'd also seen a fire a few blocks away.
"Zero clue what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The turnabout didn't go unnoticed, as conservatives ridiculed Gallant for his earlier view, tweeting messages such as "Just chill dawg," and "Huh, maybe Trump was right."
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio host, said, "Guess we're finally doing that field trip we discussed."
Gallant acknowledged the humor: "Woke up to a bunch of people tweeting 'chill dawg' at me.  I laughed."
He said he stood by his earlier statement, as he had walked through the CHAZ autonomous zone created by anarchists and found it to be less bad than it was portrayed.
"Then burning and pillaging actually happened," he said.  "Classic."
Israelis continue protests against PM's handling of pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of Israelis held several demonstrations across the country against their prime minister Saturday, with the main protest taking place in Jerusalem outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu.
The protests have been going on for the past few weeks, sparked by what critics see as a government failure to handle the coronavirus crisis after initially keeping the threat of the virus at bay.
Corruption charges against Netanyahu have further fueled the demonstrations.
"Bibi, go home," read one sign held by a protester.
Another placard read "Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes."
Hundreds of protesters Saturday also gathered outside Netanyahu's beach house in the upscale town of Caesarea.
Last week, police used water cannons to disperse crowds in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a hasty and erratic reopening of the economy in May, infections shot up with the average number of new cases daily at 2,000.
The country's economy has been battered by virus restrictions and the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to nearly 20%.
Protesters say the government's offers of financial assistance have been nowhere near enough.
The protests came in the shadow of Netanyahu's corruption trial which resumed this month.
Hearings will start in January.
He is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals.
Maurice Petty, Hall of Fame engine builder, dies at 81
KANSAS CITY, Kan.  (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a stock car racing dynasty that includes father Lee and brother Richard and the first engine builder to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, died Saturday.
He was 81.
Petty's family did not disclose the cause of death.
No funeral arrangements have been announced.
While other family members were acclaimed for their ability behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Chief" for his ability to turn a wrench.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven championships in NASCAR's premier series, and he also built engines that carried Hall of Famer Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton to victory.
"The Chief was one of the most talented mechanics in NASCAR history," chairman and chief executive Jim France.
"He provided the power that helped Petty Enterprises define dominance in sports.
While he was known for his work under the hood, Maurice played multiple behind-the-scenes roles, doing what it took to help deliver his cars to victory lane."
Maurice Petty was born March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He would tail his father to the track while growing up, and his mechanical know-how soon played an integral part in Lee Petty winning 54 races and three championships.
He made 26 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1960-64, finishing in the top 5 seven times with 16 top-10 runs.
But he quickly decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than what happened behind the wheel, and that proved to be a good move for his older brother, who would rely on his engines during his period of dominance.
Richard, who would take on the nickname "The King," won his first championship along with The Chief when he drove a Plymouth to the 1964 title.
They won again in 1967, back-to-back titles in 1970 and "71, and added three more before the 1970s drew to an end.
The seven titles remains tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the most in history.
"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers in NASCAR who helped build one of NASCAR's dominant teams in Petty Enterprises," Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelley said in a statement.
"Although the record shows 212 victories, Petty has well over 250 wins to his credit considering all the engines he built for his competitors.
Chief will forever be remember as one of the best to build power plants in NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Maurice Petty's wife of 52 years, Patricia, died in 2014.
He also was the uncle of former driver and broadcaster Kyle Petty and Truck Series crew chief Trent Owens.
"While we have lost one of NASCAR's true, gritty pioneers and heroes, Maurice Petty's legacy and memory will always be remembered, preserved, celebrated and cherished," Kelley said.
"We offer our sincere condolences to the Petty family."
Francois Bozize, deposed CAR leader, announces presidential bid
Deposed former Central African Republic President Francois Bozize announced on Saturday his candidacy for the December presidential vote despite being under United Nations sanctions and subject to an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity.
He made the announcement in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at a congress of his party, Kwa na Kwa (Work, Nothing But Work), in the capital Bangui.
The 73-year-old former general and army chief was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war and an acute and continuing humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man of experience, peace and conviction," Bozize said in the speech that criticised the tenure of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a 2003 coup and served 10 years as president before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new administration sought his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide, but has not moved to arrest him since he returned from exile late last year.
It is not clear how the warrant or foreign sanctions will affect his candidacy.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the UN to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over his alleged support for Anti-balaka Christian armed groups.
Touadera governs today with the support of a large UN peacekeeping operation with more than 13,000 troops and police.
Elected in 2016, he is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run.
The first round of the race is scheduled for December 27.
The government signed a peace deal in February 2019 with 14 armed groups, who typically claim to defend the interests of specific communities or religions.
Violence has since generally receded, but there are still bloody incidents, typically sparked by fighting over resources and most of the diamond-rich country remains beyond government control.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Kano State House of Assembly denies passing the law on castration - Freedom Radio Nigeria law.
The Kano State House of Assembly has denied that it has passed a law on castrating people convicted of rape.
Member of Parliament representing Dala Local Government, Lawan Husaini Chediyar 'Yan-Gurasa made this known in an interview with Freedom Radio.
He said, the bill had been presented in parliament in recent days, and then public opinion would have to be heard before any action could be taken.
He said the legislature would scrutinize the bill thoroughly before approving it.
The lawmaker added that stakeholders including clerics and chiefs would play a role in enforcing the law.
Kaduna State Government lock-up Restaurants In Violation Of Corona Restrictions - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The Kaduna State Ministry of Commerce, Innovation and Technology has locked-up 6 restaurant and fast foods joints and bars for violating laws designed to protect against contracting Corona virus.
The restaurants and fast foods joint were locked-up while ministry workers were patrolling to ensure the rules and regulations laid out to prevent Corona virus infection were being followed properly.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the commissioner's delegation paid surprise visits to hotels, restaurants, shops and fast foods joints in Kaduna State.
The Kaduna State Commissioner for Trade and Technology, Sama'ila Idris-Nyam, said the delegation visited sixteen business places and found six of them were not obeying the rules.
Anti-racism protesters clash with police in Seattle
Clashes in Seattle between police and anti-racism protesters resulted in dozens of arrests on Sunday, as public anger mounts over US President Donald Trump's planned "surge" of federal agents into main cities.
Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have been ignited by the death in Minneapolis of unarmed African-American George Floyd in May.
Protesters in Seattle slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows during the demonstrations on Saturday, prompting police to declare a riot and clear the streets with pepper spray and flash-bang grenades.
Protesters also set fire to trailers by a construction site for a youth detention facility.
Police said 45 people were arrested while 21 officers were injured.
The march was in support of ongoing protests in nearby Portland, Oregon.
Portland has taken centre stage for the highly controversial crackdown by federal agents ordered by Trump -- one that is not supported by local officials, who say officers use excessive force.
Protesters have marched in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky; New York; Omaha, Nebraska; California's Oakland and Los Angeles, and Richmond in Virginia.
In Austin, a man was killed in a shooting that broke out Saturday night at a protest in the downtown area of the Texas state capital, police said.
The protests come as Trump faces an increasingly tough battle for re-election in November, and is campaigning on a "law and order" platform.
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown
During his interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump questioned whether the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, could handle the barrage of questioning that Wallace posed to Trump.
The answer to that question - at least for now - we may never know.
Wallace on Sunday informed viewers that the Biden campaign told Fox News he was "not available" for an interview.
"In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter," Wallace said.
"This week, we asked the Biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available."
He added, "We'll keep asking every week."
The Trump campaign has hit Biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic.
While Biden recently has returned to the stump, Trump and his allies continued to mock the former vice president for "hiding" in his home in Delaware.
Biden's reticence to do public events, however, has done little to hurt his candidacy as the latest polls had Biden comfortably ahead of Trump both nationally and in key battleground states.
Real Clear Politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.
Trump narrowly won all four states in 2016, flipping them from blue to red as he won the White House.
The latest Fox News Polls put Biden ahead in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with leads all outside the margin of error.
Polling also suggested Biden had a slight edge in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important swing states this cycle.
And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which an incumbent is running for a second term in the White House are often a referendum on that president - and that's seen as being the case right now in the 2020 showdown between Trump and Biden.
The top issues have been the coronavirus and an economy flattened by the pandemic - and the president's performance and record on both issues.
The government has granted holidays for Eid celebration.
The federal government has declared Thursday, July 30 and Friday, the 31st of this month, as public holidays for the celebration of Eid festival.
The announcement was made by Interior Minister Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola through the ministry's Permanent Secretary, Georgina Ehuriah.
The statement said the minister congratulated the Nigerian Muslim community at home and abroad on the occasion of the Great Eid festival and prays for peaceful celebrations.
Likewise the minister also urged the community to be vigilant in following preventive measures for protection from Corona virus during the festivities.
Rauf Aregbesola added that the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was committed to upholding the rule of law and maintaining peace among the people of the country.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, goes house-hunting with her 28-year-old lover Tom Rhys Harries
They started dating on the set of White Lines, a drama about debauchery on Ibiza - but when Laura Haddock and her boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries went house-hunting last week, they cut an image of relaxed calm far from the hedonism of the party island.
The couple, who played brother and sister in the hit Netflix series, were spotted as they viewed a stunning Oxfordshire farmhouse, which is on the market for £1.2 million.
They arrived in a Range Rover driven by Laura, 34, wearing denim shorts and a white top, and were met by an estate agent who ushered them inside for a look around the five-bedroom home.
In White Lines, which was filmed last autumn, Laura played Zoe Walker, who discovers the seedy side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her DJ brother Axel, played by 28-year-old Tom.
News of their relationship only emerged earlier this month, less than a year after the collapse of Laura's six-year marriage to Sam Claflin, who starred in The Hunger Games films.
Together they have a son, four-year-old Pip, and a daughter Margot, two.
When they announced their split last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: "Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together."
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 at an audition and Sam, who's also been in Peaky Blinders, described their marriage in 2013 as "easily one of his greatest achievements."
Before White Lines, Laura appeared in the first Inbetweeners film and last year's BBC crime-drama The Capture, playing lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom has appeared in the Inbetweeners sequel and Sky drama Britannia.
Attacks on Nigerian Media Outlets is very Worrisome - United Nations.
The United Nations and the United Kingdom have described the increase in attacks on the media offices and journalists in Nigeria as a serious concern.
For this reason, The United Nations and the British government have called on the authorities to end all pressure they exert on the media sector and its staff. This is necessary because the authorities will be held accountable for the harassment.
The British Ambassador to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, made this announcement on Monday at the 2020 conference of the Day for the Prevention of Crime against Journalists.
The Ambassador messaged on his Twitter page that having a fully independent media is a must for any government.
Journalists should not be harassed in any way or attacked.
So too Ronald Kayanja, the UN's director of communication for Nigeria, also said that on such an important day, it was absolutely necessary to publicly affirm the protection of the journalists and media offices.
Kayanja said attacks on media outlets and media staff are a very serious concern, and because of this he called on the authorities to investigate allegations of such abuses in order to uphold truth and justice.
Kayanja said another step in eliminating fake news is through supporting private media outlets.
Just as support is being given to other sectors of the economy, in order to rebuild and strengthen them, it would be good for the media outlets to be supported as well. We have just brought you reports that showed that there are at least three media outlets which were burned during the riots to end SARS, with many journalists injured while doing their duty to tell the world how the protests were taking place.
EID KABIR: Abuja residents perform Eid prayers at Friday mosques that are near them.
The Minister for Abuja, Muhammad Bello, has called on Abuja residents to perform Eid prayers at nearby Friday mosques instead of going to the Eid grounds.
Bello made the remarks in a statement issued by his ministry's information secretary Anthony Ogunleye to newsmen on Tuesday in Abuja.
He said worshipers should go to nearby mosques to offer Eid prayers instead of going to the Eid prayer grounds.
Bello said the government took the decision after consulting a group of clerics on ways to help protect people's health from Corona infection during the Eid Kabir Festival.
Bello later called on clerics to devise ways to help prevent congestion in mosques.
And not to spend more than one hour at the place of prayers.
The Federal Government has declared Thursday, July 30 and Friday, July 31, the main Eid Kabir holidays and called on Nigerians to abide by the rules and regulations to avoid contracting Corona disease, regulations set by the government and the NCDC for the time of the Eid Kabir festivities.
Abuja is one of the places in Nigeria where numbers of Corona virus cases are growing the fastest.

Buhari government has released reformed 601 Boko Haram members to their homes.
On Saturday the government of President Muhammadu Buhari released 601 reformed Boko Haram members to their homes, after they spent six-months in deradicalization and reintegration exercises.
The small graduation ceremony was held at the Boko Haram Terrorism Reintegration Center in Malam Sidi town, Kwami Local Government Area of ​​Gombe State.
They are given counseling and vocational training under the program for reforming terrorists called "De-radicalization, Reintegration and Reorientation" (DRR) under the important Boko Haram reintegration program. It is called "Operation Safe Corridor", that is, you surrender and be arrested, and then you repent and you will not do it again.
Major General Bamidele Shafa, the program director, said these 601 to be released were the fourth group of Boko Haram members to be released after their reformation.
He said they spent six months, that is since they were registered at the camp in December, and had been trained in good manners.
Originally they were 606, but three died at the center as a result of an illness they had suffered since long before they surrendered.
One of them has been isolated for some reason, and is being charged, and another has been sent to a psychiatric hospital.
587 are Nigerians, the other 14 are from Niger, Chad and Cameroon.

Americans are eager for the completion of the presidential election
Americans are still waiting for the final results of the presidential election.
Now the focus is on certain states on the battlefield, where preliminary results are showing very small margins, but they can be very effective in indicating which candidate will win: Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden and the incumbent Republican, Donald Trump.
In New York, all votes are required to be counted while the country continues to await news of the winner.
People across the country are eager, including in Pennsylvania, one of the battlefield states.
Even now counting ballots is still going on in a few key states.
But after Joe Biden was declared the winner of Michigan and Wisconsin - two states that President Trump won four years ago - Biden said he was confident he would win the Electoral College votes, at least the 270 required to win the election.
Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, says, "I didn't come here to say we won the election, I came here to make it clear that once the counting of ballots is complete, we believe that victory is ours".
Georgia, which is traditionally a Republican state, is one of the battlefields, where support for Biden in and around urban areas is seen to possibly take him to victory.
While the ballot counting was being prepared, President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he was the obvious victor in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan, a claim that Twitter described as "unsubstantiated".
The Trump campaign committee is preparing to rush to court to stop the counting in Michigan and Pennsylvania, on the grounds that the Republican Party was not allowed to fully monitor the counting process.
President Donald Trump said, "We are going to the Supreme Court of America.
We want to stop all counting of votes.
We do not want them to get more votes by 4:00 am to increase the number of votes.
William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said: “Each of the candidates has the right to request a recount of ballots if the difference between them is less than 1 percent.
But historically, the recounting of ballots has not necessarily resulted in a tally much different from the first, so a recount will not guarantee the result that he desires.
Hundreds of Trump supporters demonstrated at a counting station in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday night, with accusations of failure to follow the rules for certain ballots.
From all indications the final results of Arizona and other states are likely to be decided by a court of law.
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox Speak On Experiences of Discrimination
Over the last few weeks it has become evident that are many skeletons in relation to racial discrimination in South African sport.
Constructive conversations need to be had and action has to be taken in order to forge more inclusive sports.
Former Proteas batting star Ashwell Prince has lashed out at his former white team mates, accusing them of racial bias by labelling him and other black squad members as "quota players."
Prince said that in the Proteas team black players were openly labelled "quota players" by their white teammates.
Adding that it is sad that even when black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada who ascended to the pinnacle of the game, they still have the quota tag attached to them by some people.
Prince, the current coach of the Cape Cobras franchise, made the comments on a webinar hosted by the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The organisation aims to further the raging conversation of historic racial discrimination in South African sports.
"Like I said in my social media outburst, it's not my idea to come and drag people's names through the mud, but these are real incidents...
The Waiting for the Results of the US Election Continues.
Americans are still waiting for the election results in some contested states, to see if the incumbent President Donald Trump will continue to lead the country, or whether his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, will replace him.
Tensions continue in Washington DC.
And in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday night, as people wait for results of the presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
No one has yet received 270 of the 538 votes for the special delegates called the Electoral College, which a candidate is required to have before winning the election.
In the US election system, however, the number of votes a candidate receives in a general election does not determine his victory.
Jeremy Myer is a professor at George Mason University in the United States.
He said, "There are indications that the two candidates will be evenly matched".
The surprising thing about this election is that it can almost be said that what happened in the 2016 election is happening again, a phenomenon that will once again affect these three states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Originally Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were Democrat states, which Trump won in the 2016 election.
Both candidates have been campaigning in these districts in the last days before the election.
Early morning today, Wednesday, from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden called on his supporters to exercise more patience.
Keep believing, we will emerge victorious!
Thank you thank you thank you.
Shortly afterwards, Trump was quick to respond in a Twitter message, saying that Democrats were trying to steal the election, a message that Twitter described as one which would cause chaos.
But later, he came out to speak from the White House.
This is an unpleasant experience, in my opinion, this is a time for reflection.
But we will win, in fact, I think we have already won.
Even though the president is claiming victory, counting of votes will continue, and it may take days before the real winner is known.
La Trice Washington is a Lecturer at the University of Otterbein.
She said, "Because of the Covid-19 epidemic, we have seen how more people are sending their ballots by post".
As a result, there are more people who want to vote in this way, which will cause a short delay (in counting).
Americans certainly have held peaceful elections, even though police have been deployed at some polling stations, and security forces are on high alert after a long heated campaign, which brought divisions between people.
While there have been evenly-matched votes in many states, and lawsuits have been filed in court over election rules, which may have an impact on the votes to be counted, the struggle for votes in the U.S. election will take months before it comes to an end.
Five Emir's Councilmen Resign in Zamfara.
The Shinkafi Emirate of Zamfara State in northern Nigeria has conferred on Femi Fani Kayode, the former Minister of Civil Aviation of Nigeria the traditional title of Sadaukin Shinkafi or Brave Warrior, which did not go down well with the people of Shinkafi.
Five members of the Emir's Council have resigned in protest of Emir Muhammad Makwashe's decision.
Doctor. Tijjani Salihu, a member of the Emir's Council and a lecturer at Usman Dan Fodio University in Sokoto, told the representative of Voice of America that he had resigned from his position as "Father of Shinkafi's Orphans" because, according to him, a royal title had been given to an enemy of northern Nigeria, a frequent critic of the Sultan, and that is unfortunate.
Also Alhaji Sulaiman Shu'aibu, who has resigned as the "The Overseer of Shinkafi's Cattle ", told the representative of VOA that he left his position because he did not approve of Femi Fani Kayode's traditional title in Shinkafi in view of his long standing criticism of the north and its leaders.
He added that the title Sadauki is a noble one, and each one who holds the title is one who has dedicated his life and wealth to the communities of the region, to their religion, culture and communal living, and to protect the dignity and the interests of these communities.
The Special Adviser to the Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Zailani Baffa, told the VOA representative that the government is not the one that chooses the people to whom the emirs who give titles.
Differently-Abled Homeless Women Part Of Chennai's COVID-19 Fight
Shanthi, a differently-abled master tailor, visits 250 homes everyday to identify symptomatic people in Kodambakkam, a key Covid hotspot in Chennai with around 10,000 positive cases.
Her day starts as early as 7:30 AM and finishes at around 4 PM.
She checks the temperature of residents, quizes them for symptoms, and spreads awareness on wearing masks, frequently washing hands, and social distancing.
Her efforts have even helped the early identification and recovery of four positive people.
Shanthi is among Chennai City corporation's 16,000 non-medical workers who conduct door-to-door screening.
The iniative, authorties say, has led to a 50 per cent fall in positive cases in Chennai's daily tally even as they rise in other Tamil Nadu districts.
Shanthi says not all residents are cooperative.
She adds, "Most people cooperate seeing a differently-abled woman reaching out to them.
Some feel irritated too.
I'd not be worried.
For me, people should be safe.
When I visit them again the next day they are polite.
Establishing a good rapport helps."
And there are several others like Shanthi who stay at the corportation's homeless shelter for differently abled women and help in the fight against Covid-19.
Not far away Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also differently-abled, has joined the effort as a supervisor.
Though she has a retrofitted bike, Kavitha walks holding her crutches to meet people.
"I am happy," she says about the decline in numbers, but adds, "I want this to come down to perhaps around 100 a day.
I'm confident we can reach that."
On the ground floor of the homeless shelter where the two stay, Matilda Funceca, a wheelchair basketball player, and Manimekalai, a school teacher, upload all the data sent by around 40 women to Chennai Corporation's server.
Matilda says she has no fear of contracting coronavirus.
"When we help others, God will protect us" she adds.
Asked about the precautions they take, Manimekalai explains: "I wear a mask, follow social distancing and do frequent hand wash.
I also take Kabasura Kudineer, Siddha immunity-boosting drink."
A few months ago, when corona first struck Chennai these differently-abled women used their time and talent to stitch masks for sanitary workers in the city.
Dr Aishwarya Rao, director of the Shelter and Dorcas Research Centre that runs the shelter, said "They adapt according to the need of the hour.
Earlier mask was needed and they rose to the occasion.
Now it's time for community intervention and they readily said yes."
Coronavirus cases in Tamil Nadu have crossed the two lakh-mark with 6,989 new cases reported in the last 24 hours, which is also the biggest single-day spike, government data shows.
Eighty-nine have died and 7,758 have recovered in the last 24 hours.
The total cases in the state is now 2,06,737.
Will Prince Andrew be named in new sex dossier?
Royal prepares to fight back against possible disclosure in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
US Judge ordered release of secret documents relating to Epstein and Maxwell
The 80 pages of documents contain sections of Maxwell's 2016 testimonies
Release of the pages could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew as they include communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in 2015 court papers that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew
Prince Andrew is preparing to fight back against the possible disclosure this week of further damaging allegations about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.
US District Judge Loretta Preska last week ordered the release of 80 secret legal documents, running to hundreds of pages, relating to Maxwell and Epstein.
The publication of the vast tranche of papers would be a blow for Maxwell, 58, as they feature large sections of testimony she gave to lawyers in 2016, including what her legal team said was "intrusive questioning" about her sex life.
They could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew because one of the documents includes communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in court papers that she was forced to have sex with the Prince on three occasions.
Andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the claims.
A leaked email from 2015 that was revealed last year by the BBC appears to suggest that Andrew asked for Maxwell's help in dealing with Ms Roberts's claims.
We have no doubt the Duke will be vindicated
In it, he told the socialite: "Let me know when we can talk.  Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts."
Maxwell replied: "Have some info.  Call me when you have a moment."
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: "The Duke of York has done nothing wrong, so we are relaxed about the unsealing of any court documents.
As the US courts have been at pains to point out, just because an allegation is included in court papers does not make them true.
"The US courts have urged the media and public to treat any allegations contained in court papers with extreme caution.
We entirely concur.
We have no doubt the Duke will be completely vindicated in the weeks ahead."
Maxwell is being held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting trial for recruiting and grooming some of Epstein's underage victims between 1994 and 1997.
She is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge in legal depositions of his abuse.
She denies all the allegations.
Maxwell was interviewed by lawyers in April and July 2016 as part of a defamation lawsuit brought by Ms Roberts, who now goes by her married surname Giuffre.
About 40 of 418 pages of that testimony were made public last year, but following last week's ruling by Judge Preska in New York, further sections could be unsealed as early as Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers were given a week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell last year while he was awaiting trial for sex offences.
MOPPAN has reiterated the expulsion of Rahama Sadau.
She was brought back by the Kano Film Censorship Board, according to the filmmakers.
The Kannywood Motion Picture Practitioners Association of Nigeria, better known as MOPPAN, has reiterated its decision to expel one of the most iconic figures in the Hausa film industry, Rahama Sadau after someone insulted the Prophet of Allah (SAW) as a result of an accusation of the film star posting her bare all pictures while he commented.
It will be recalled that, Actress Rahama Sadau has faced criticism and disparagement from both Muslim and Hausa communities as well as many of her colleagues for posting a half-nude photo of herself on Twitter, an action that generated controversy between followers of various religions, after a commentator, allegedly a non-Muslim, insulted the Prophet of Allah.
This gave rise to the nickname "Assistant Allah", words that the actress allegedly first used in an attempt to express her displeasure with the innuendos she suffered from others regarding the picture, from those who say that this is contrary to the teachings of Islam, which she follows.
After the person who allegedly made derisive remarks about the Prophet also made his critique, this drew criticism even from filmmakers in Northern Nigeria, so this association of filmmakers came out and distanced itself from the actress.
In a statement from the National Chairman, Dr. Ahmad Sarari yesterday, the organization's official public relations officer, Al-Amin Ciroma condemned Rahama's actions, saying she was a disgraced hero in the organization, except that the Kano State Film Censorship Board (KSCB) under the leadership of Ismail Na'abba Afakallahu suddenly brought her back.
The association recalled that since 2016, the actress has been expelled from the industry for violating the association's code of conduct after she featured in a video song with a Musician named Classic in which they were embracing each other.
The statement continued that, "The umbrella body of all actors in the Northern Nigerian Film Industry Association, MOPPAN, also known as Kannywood, has expressed her displeasure over the posting of the photo by the outstanding actress Rahama Sadau on social media," a picture which is proliferating in the media.
The image has drawn a lot of criticism, as the picture which led to the insult on Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) on Twitter and other social media platforms.
This is a scandalous crime and is condemned by MOPPAN.
It may be recalled that about four years ago, on October 2, 2016, the umbrella organization expelled Sadau from the film industry, but after about two years the KSCB said it had pardoned her, despite the fact that Kano is the largest Hausa film production center in the world.
MOPPAN says, "Two years after the expulsion, the Kano State Film Censorship Board (KSCB) through its chairman, Mallam Isma'il Na'Abba Afakkallah".
On January 8, 2018, the association pardoned Rahama for all alleged misconduct, and allowed her to re-enter Kannywood, a move challenged by the Kano State MOPPAN Branch on January 15, 2018, under the leadership of the branch chair, Malam Kabiru Maikaba.
The statement added that, "Given the current situation, MOPPAN reaffirms its original position on Rahama Sadau and calls on all Kannywood organizations to abide by this decision and enforce it".
MOPPAN then called on all professionals in Kannywood and the rest of the Hausa community at home and abroad to take note of the fact that the group has already distanced itself from Rahama Sadau and any wrongdoing she may do now or in the future.
People were once again pained that the film star refused to remove her post and photos for days.
Well, but also after things escalated, the film star removed the photos and yesterday afternoon she came out on social media with a text and video distancing herself from the insulting comment about the Prophet (SAW) and the person who made it, although Sadau did not come out clearly to answer that it was wrong to post the pictures in the first place.
Man United secure Champions League ticket - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
With difficulty Manchester United has managed to qualify for the Champions League after winning over their opponents, Leicester City.
In the final match, and the 38th of the 2019/20 season, Manchester United won by two goals to nil at Leicester's Kingpower Stadium.
After half time in the second period, Bruno Fernandez scored in the 71st minute with a penalty kick, after Martial had won the kick.
When the game was about to end in the 90th minutes, Leicester City's goalkeeper Kasper Schemiechel mistakenly passed the ball to Manchester United striker Jesse Lingard, who used the opportunity to score the second goal instantly. That puts them in fourth place and last in the teams that will represent the country in next year's Champions League, after scoring 66 points.

Police: Man fatally shot at protest in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A man was fatally shot at a protest in Texas when he approached a vehicle and the driver inside opened fire, police said.
The shooting happened just before 10 p.m. during a protest in Austin, police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told reporters early Sunday.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
The vehicle had honked, turned down a road and then sped toward protesters, witness Michael Capochiano told the Austin American-Statesman.
The man, who Capochiano said was carrying a rifle, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, Capochiano said.
Initial reports indicated "the victim may have been carrying a rifle," Ratliff told reporters, adding that the suspect was detained and was cooperating with police.
The crowd gathered Saturday for a Black Lives Matter protest, news outlets reported.
The demonstration was streamed live on Facebook and captured audio of a vehicle's horn honking and several gunshots being fired.

Follow up on the relationship of mutual respect between married couples - Part One -November, 05, 2020.
The matter of abuse in the family is a multi-faceted issue that can affect a man or a woman, adult or child.
Mostly in married couples, women are more likely to have this problem and among children, step-children from previous marriage are more likely to find themselves in this situation.
In recent years there have been circumstances in which for certain reasons either parents abuse their own children or spouses abuse their partners.
Today 'For the Family' program has invited some observers and social welfare workers in to look for solutions.
The panelists on the program included Muhammad Hadi Musa, a psychologist and expert in family matters, Barrista Amina Umar Hussain, Secretary of the Kano State International Women Lawyers Association, and Mal Abdulra'uf Magidanci, a social welfare worker.
Google Pixel 4 able to photograph Milky Way
Along with adding 2x optical zoom, the second lens allows the Pixel 4 to see in 3D; thus doing a better job of blurring the background in portrait mode than previous Pixel handsets, which relied purely on software to achieve this "bokeh" effect.
To establish the camera's credentials, Google brought legendary portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz on stage to talk about her experience shooting with the Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Machine learning is still a strong focus for every aspect of Google's new smartphones, relying on "computational photography" to improve its HDR+ mode by combining up to nine different images.
New dual exposure controls offer separate sliders for brightness and shadows, allowing users to preview HDR+ in real-time.
The phone also relies on machine learning for improved auto white balance and an enhanced Night Sight night mode, which is sensitive enough to capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
Beyond the second camera lens, the Pixel 4 introduces a Soli "radar chip" front sensor which recognises Motion Sense gestures, allowing users to skip music, dismiss timers, snooze alarms or silence their phone with a wave of their hand.
All Motion Sense computations run in the device rather than connecting to the internet, as does the improved Google Assistant, as the tech giant focused on both reducing response times and enhancing user privacy.
Google's continued push to make the most of its machine learning capabilities has also spawned a new voice recorder app which transcribes audio live, without sending data to the internet.
For now the app only supports in English, with more languages to come.
The Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support the Google Stadia cloud gaming platform, which opens its doors on November 19 in the US but is yet to receive an Australian launch date.
Beyond the new Pixel handsets, Google also unveiled a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook and second-generation Google Pixel Buds.
Arriving next year, but not confirmed for Australia, the new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earbuds are completely wireless and feature adaptive audio which monitors your environment and continually adjusts the sound to provide optimal clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earbuds are completely wireless and adjust the sound to the noise levels around you.
Meanwhile, Google also announced an upgrade to its mesh Wi-Fi home routers in the Nest WiFi, relying on a new separate router combined with several base stations working in unison to improve wireless coverage through the home.
Adopting the Nest name, the new Wi-Fi system doubles the range of its predecessor and adds a built-in microphone and speaker for using Google Assistant on each base station around the home.
It launches in Australia on November 5, for $399 with the router and one Wi-Fi point, or $549 AUD with a second Wi-Fi point.
The Google Home Mini also received an upgrade, with the new $79 Nest Mini improving sound quality - doubling the bass - and adding an integrated wall mount.
All Google smart speakers are set to receive a new intercom feature for communicating between devices in the home, plus the ability to call the Nest Mini from outside the home using the Google Home app.
Manchester United and Chelsea have qualified for the Champions League.
Manchester United and Chelsea have qualified for next season's Champions League, after both sides won their final Premier League games on Sunday.
Since last week Liverpool lifted up this year's Premier League trophy of the competition which began on August 19 last year, but was temporarily suspended for three months due to the coronavirus outbreak.
United finished third in the Premier League table with a 2-0 win over their competitor Leicester City, while they or Chelsea slipped to 4th after it also beat the Wolves 2-1.
Leicester, which ended 5th in the table or will be competing in the Europa League next season, will face Tottenham, who finished 6th, after a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace.
At the bottom of the table Bournemouth and Watford fell from their positions of 28th and 29th in the Premier League table, following in the footsteps of Norwich who were confirmed in their fall since last week.
China's large market is again attracting the attention of international investors.
Roy, research and development manager at Theland Dairy Factory in New Zealand stated, "Although we are facing difficulties, we will definitely be going to Shanghai to attend the CIIE, China's third import fair and exhibition".
It is indeed time to express the views of foreign entrepreneurs who have come to China to attend the CIIE, as they struggle with the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic.
The third CIIE exposition was launched this afternoon according to plan, this major economic and trade project is uniquely prepared to be held in China since the country's International Service Fair that China scheduled last September.
In addition to showing the international community China's achievements in curbing COVID-19, the exposition is also contributing to the global economic recovery.
Over the past three years, this forum of high-level international cooperation has made significant progress.
For example, the size of the exhibition center has increased by almost 30,000 square meters, and the size of the exhibition space of the world's 500 largest companies has also increased by 14 percent, among them, more than ten companies attended the ceremony for the first time.
It was noted that the exhibitions of health products and oral medications attract the most attention, especially those dedicated to exhibiting products to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
At the same time, for the first time, the products will be sold directly on video, in which popular internet celebrities will be invited to advertise, so that buyers can purchase high quality international products via videos as they wish.
Certainly the event of CIIE in China is also continuing to attract the attention of international businessmen as it has for the past three years.
The number of the world's 500 largest companies which repeatedly attended the event reached 70 percent, and the reason for this is that they made huge profits from the exposition, and even expect to enter China's large market this year, even in this unique year.
In addition, the reason the exposition is attracting more and more international investors is because of China's efforts to open up to the outside world.
Since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has issued a series of new policies to improve the business environment.
Even now the large market of China, which has a population of 1.4 billion, is currently attracting international dignitaries through the forum of the CIIE exhibition, which is expected to advance global economic recovery.
Governors Ought to Improve Education at Traditional Qur'anic Centers - Hon. Kakale.
Nigerian governors, especially those from the north-western part of the country, have been urged to come up with a comprehensive plan to improve education at traditional Qur'anic centers so that disciples have access to quality education and trades and stop begging and wandering on the streets.
The request was made by Dr Balarabe Shehu Kakale, a Member of the Federal Parliament, representing Bodinga, Shuni and Tureta constituencies in Sokoto State in northwestern Nigeria, during an interview with Voice Of America.
Dr. Kakale said it was wrong for some governors to return some disciples to their home states due to fears of the spread of COVID-19, as doing so violated their human rights.
Religiously, medically, or officially, people should not be allowed to be moving from one place to another during a pandemic, as this would increase the spread of the disease.
It is a tragic that the students were picked up in truck trailer and jam-packed together, said Dr. Balarabe Shehu Kakale.
He said governors should follow the example of some other governors who said they would take care of their disciples because as Nigerians they were free, and because of that it was necessary to do everything possible to improve their lives.
Finally, he called on Nigerian governors to put in place a comprehensive curriculum for Qur'anic centers so that students can stop begging on the street.
Moreover he called on the federal government to allocate more funds in the budget for Qur'anic education centers, just as it allocates funds for western education.

The couple's new biography, Finding Freedom, claims they felt left out of the photo collection on show in the festive address.
Pictures on the desk that The Queen was sitting at included Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla along with Prince Philip.
Yet, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen having welcomed Archie last May - although the youngster did get a mention as Her Majesty's 'eighth great-grandchild'.
The new book - which is set to be released in August - also reveals that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" as they "struggled to move past distant politeness" and they only met up on a few occasions.
It was claimed yesterday that Prince Harry's split with his brother William started years before his romance with Meghan - and that it came to a head over William's marriage to Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt like a "spare part" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton - with it claimed, "long before Meghan he wanted to change things."
Lack of Information on Election Results Caused Some Americans to Protest.
Some small groups of supporters of President Trump gathered outside ballot-counting centers in the states of Michigan and Arizona.
Demonstrators also marched in the cities of Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.
In addition to the call for a vote count, demonstrators also protested against racial inequality, which has led to protests across the United States this year.
Supporters of President Donald Trump went to the ballot counting centers in Detroit, Michigan, demanding a halt to the counting.
Some did their own protests later in the town of Phoenix, Arizona, chanting, "Stop stealing".
Since Tuesday various protests have been happening as a result of continuing uncertainties about the election, as well as allegations by the president, although without evidence, saying that the election was rigged and Republicans filed many complaints about the election.
Octavia Spencer calls on Hollywood to increase casting of people with disabilities
The actress is part of a new PSA that calls for increased inclusion of those with disabilities in entertainment.
The campaign coincides with Sunday's 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
The video shows Spencer discussing the importance of everyone being able to see themselves and their lives accurately reflected on screen.
"Nothing can replace lived experience and authentic representation," she said.
"That's why it's imperative that we cast the appropriate actor for the appropriate role."
Spencer discussed the impact she felt seeing a family of color on screen as a young girl watching the show "Good Times."
The series, which ran on CBS from 1974 to 1979, was created by Norman Lear and broke barriers as television's first African American two-parent family sitcom.
A vocational training center is the best school.
Nurimangul Obulqasim once studied at a vocational training center in state of Xinjiang.
Now she is the director of women's affairs in a village, and she remembers that because of extreme poverty she did not get much education.
The first time she entered the center, she was amazed to see the state-of-the-art equipment it has.
She said this center is the best school for her.
The students of the center receive 6 lessons every day from Monday to Friday, where they learn standardized Chinese, law, legal, vocational skills and the elimination of extremist opinions.
During the rest days of Saturday and Sunday, they attend religious services.
She said some media outlets had reported that the center had removed the kidneys of its students and forced them to cut their hair, which she described as baseless.
She said she welcomes these media outlets to visit Xinjiang to get a first-hand look at the situation, as well as to talk with students who have previously received training at the center.
The government of Kwara state and the Dangote Foundation will support 15,000 women in the state.
The Kwara State Government in collaboration with the Dangote Foundation will divide N150 million in support money among 15,000 women to start business in the rural areas of the state.
Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq's deputy, Kayode Oyin-Zubair, made the announcement on community development in Ilorin on Tuesday.
Oyin-Zubair said each woman would be given N10,000 by the end of 2020.
He said the government was doing this to improve the living conditions of the rural people in order to reduce the congestion in the cities, so that those in villages also could engage in business instead of flocking to the cities.
The government will then work with the agency "Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN)" to provide women with locust bean seeds so that they too continue to compete in agriculture.
He said the government would arrange with the government of Kenya to trade locust bean seeds in the markets of that country as well as other countries.
On October 28, PREMIUM TIMES reported that the Federal Government had provided N20,000 in grants to each of 2,800 rural women in Zamfara State through the Grant Project for Rural Women.

States claiming to create state police cannot pay salary - Buhari - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The presidency says many of the states that are calling for permission to create their own state police departments are not even able to pay the salaries of their current employees.
The Special Assistant to the President on media affairs, Garba Shehu, explained this in an interview with a TV station, Channels.
Malam Garba Shehu said he was surprised to hear that states whose workers were owed salaries in arrears for many months are complaining that they were not allowed to form their own police force.
He said the federal government was doing anything possible to curb the work of criminals in all parts of the country.
Malam Garba Shehu also said that this was the reason why the government was trying to create a community police force that would help address security concerns.

Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok has announced a series of meetings on key issues with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Khartoum, including the removal of Sudan from the list of countries designated by Washington as sponsors of terrorists.
Pompeo arrived in Kartoum from Israel, an American effort to encourage relations between Sudan and Israel.
His visit is part of a regional tour, after accomplishing the goal of an agreement to restore ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates this month.
The United States is urging other Arab countries to follow in Abu Dhabi's footsteps.
Since the ousted President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Washington has imposed sanctions on Sudan for allegedly supporting extremist groups and Darfur's civil war.
Cease-fire in war-torn eastern Ukraine to begin at midnight
KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and rebel forces in war-torn eastern Ukraine have started preparing for a "full and comprehensive" cease-fire scheduled to begin at midnight, a move that officials hope can lead to more steps to resolve the 6-year-old conflict.
Rebel officials said Sunday they have instructed their troops about the cease-fire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons.
Ukraine's military said their forces "have begun preparations" for the ceasefire.
If upheld, it would "pave the way for implementing other clauses" of the Minsk peace deal, the office of Ukraine's president said earlier this week, calling the cease-fire a "breakthrough."
Brokered in 2015 by France and Germany, the Minsk peace plan aimed to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists that flared in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists.
The conflict has since killed more than 14,000.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both commended the cease-fire deal in a phone call Sunday and underscored the importance of implementing the agreements reached at the December summit in Paris.
Russia President Vladimir Putin expressed concern over Kyiv's calls to revise the Minsk agreements and said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's "position about the non-alternative nature of the Minsk agreements, once again voiced during this call, should translate into real actions," the Kremlin said.
Zelenskiy in turn, stressed the need "for further practical steps" aimed at releasing Ukrainians who are imprisoned by rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the annexed region of Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement by his office.
The 2015 deal envisaged that Ukraine can regain control over its border with Russia in the separatist-held regions only after they are granted broad self-rule and hold local elections.
The accord helped reduce the scope of hostilities, but Ukrainian forces and the rebels have continued to exchange artillery salvos and gunfire.
In December, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris for another round of talks, expressing support for the Minsk deal and agreeing to revive the peace process.
Zelenskiy, who won the 2019 election on promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to get control of its border first before local elections, but the Kremlin has insisted the deal should be implemented without revisions.
The new cease-fire deal was reached Wednesday by members of the Tripartite Contact Group that includes representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and was welcomed by EU officials.
During his traditional Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis also commended the cease-fire, adding that it needed to be put into practice ″to rebuild confidence and lay the foundations for a much needed and long awaited reconciliation with the people.″
Heart attack: Eating chocolate once a week may reduce risk of the deadly condition
New research has pinpointed a certain indulgence may be good for the heart muscle.
What is it?  And how would it reduce the chances of a heart attack?
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis spanning five decades looking into coronary heart disease (CHD).
CHD - that also goes by the name of ischaemic heart disease - has three main symptoms: chest pain (angina), heart attacks and heart failure.
Other symptoms of the disease can include heart palpitations and unusual breathlessness.
"Chocolate contains heart-healthy nutrients such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."
Good cholesterol, otherwise known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), collects "bad" cholesterol - the kind that furs up the heart's arteries - and transports it to the liver.
In the liver, "bad" (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body.
However, the new study doesn't examine portion sizes, or the type of chocolate enjoyed.
It's not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or some other cocoa confectionery.
The findings were based on previous research that concluded that consuming cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
It's believed by scientists the flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how effectively the blood delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries away waste material.
In regards to the new research, lifestyle factors weren't highlighted in the results.
Dr Alice Lichtenstein commented on the data, suggesting that those who admitted to eating chocolate may be more likely to have "a healthy body weight."
She added that they could "regularly engage" in physical exercise and be "less stressed."
She continued: "Each factor could independently impact on cardiovascular health."
Nigerian Hajj Pilgrims Board To Start Receiving next year's Hajj Payment.
The Chairman of the Board, Zikirullah Olakunle Hassan, made this known at a press conference in Abuja.
The Hausa Service reporter, Medina Dauda attended the meeting and informed us that the Chairman of the Pilgrims Board, Barrister Zikirullah Olakunle Hassan, said that beginning from September 9 the board would start collecting payment from pilgrims intending to perform the 2021 Hajj.
Ahaji Hassan added that the board would launch a new internet website to make it easier for applicants to register.
While he was elaborating on whether some of the pilgrims who did not make the hajj this year will receive their money, the chairman of the Hajj Board advised the pilgrims for next year's hajj to start saving their money now in advance in the board's special account.
Another concern is that the coronavirus has caused Saudi Arabia to cancel this year's hajj, and then increase taxes in Saudi Arabia, so will this increase affect the money that the pilgrims will have to pay?
The Commissioner of the Pilgrims Board, Nura Ahmed Yakasai said the only thing that was certain was that Saudi Arabia had increased taxes, but regarding things like accommodation and transport vehicles there was no certainty of increment yet, since they normally change every year.
Therefore, the aim of the board is to make it easier for all intending pilgrims from Nigeria to have opportunity to attend the Hajj.
What remains to be seen is the success of the search for a cure for coronavirus or vaccinations against it so that pilgrims can perform the hajj.
'I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people' - Chimaev after making history on UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as a UFC star-in-waiting after making history on Fight Island, but the Russian-born fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of Conor McGregor.
Chimaev overwhelmed Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in their welterweight contest in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, finishing his opponent with a ground-and-pound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round.
The win ensured Chimaev etched his name into the UFC history books by claiming the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion, coming just 10 days after he defeated Britain's John Phillips in similarly destructive fashion - on that occasion at middleweight.
The 8-0 Chimaev pocketed a $50,000 Performance-of-the-Night bonus for his work against McKee and has firmly earned the attention of the MMA world, being tipped as 'Khabib 2.0' - a perhaps inevitable comparison given Chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the UFC lightweight champ, and was born in Chechnya, which neighbors Khabib's own Dagestani homeland.
Despite the newfound fame and financial boost, the softly-spoken Chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of MMA money-man Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent Floyd Mayweather Jr.
"I do this not only for me, I do this for everybody I can help.
I don't want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, to show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," replied Chimaev when asked on Fight Island about how he would spend his bonus.
One man he has gained the attention of is Conor McGregor teammate and arch Twitter protagonist Dillon Danis, who took to the platform to claim he could submit Chimaev "easily."
That drew a withering response from the fighter known as 'Borz' - or 'wolf' in his native Chechen - who said he would "smash Danis with his eyes closed."
Chimaev, who now fights out of Stockholm, Sweden, having moved to the country at the age of 19, may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects.
"I can smash everybody...
How many fighters in the welterweight division?
I can smash all of them," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos (welterweight) champion, 84 kilos (middleweight) champion, I'm going to smash both of them, same day."

WHO is the leader of the fight against polio in Nigeria.
Faisal Shuaib, the chairman of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), said that the World Health Organization (WHO) is the leader of the fight against polio in Nigeria.
Shuaib made the remarks while receiving the WHO Representative in Nigeria at his office on Monday.
He said Nigeria would receive a certificate of complete eradication of polio in Africa in August from the World Health Organization.
This follows the satisfaction of the Commission for Eradication of Polio in African countries (ARCC) regarding the government's efforts to demonstrate polio eradication in Africa.

This is the first time in history that steps have been taken to prevent pilgrims from other parts of the world from participating in hajj.
The Ministry of Hajj said it is necessary because of fears of spreading Coronavirus.
Prince Harry news: Duke of Sussex's friend lashes out at explosive claims in new book
Mr Stott told Sky News that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that the content within the book was no different to that in tabloids other than it was in a hardback.
The former soldier called for more focus on the good the couple do including their charity work.
Mr Stott said: "I think what we are reading here is no different from what we have read in the tabloids it is now just on a hardback."
"You have got an author's persona, it is still not guaranteed that it has come from them."
"I just think it is another sort of attack like the tabloids trying to persecute them."
"I understand they are in the public eye and people wish to know what they are doing but I wish the focus was more on the good that they do and the charity work rather than their intimate privacies."
"But because of who they are they will never get away from that of course."
On Saturday a royal historian also stated that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex supporting the Queen "overshadowed" other members of the Royal Family.
Dr Kate Williams told Sky News that the Royal Family were unable to harness Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's star power.
The royal commentator added that the Royal Family has a strict hierarchy but that public interest cannot be directed or controlled.
She continued: "The fact is that whatever they did to support the Queen would often overshadow other members of the Royal Family and that was seen as a problem."
"They have this huge star power."
"They had a small wedding than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne had a huge wedding."
"They had a small wedding but still the coverage of Harry and Meghan's wedding even though it was smaller was still as big as William's and Kate's because there is a worldwide fascination with them."
Delhi Metro Casts First Pier Under Phase-4 Work
The Delhi Metro has reached a major milestone in the Phase-4 work as it cast its first pier on the under-construction Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, officials said on Sunday.
The pier was cast at Keshopur on the elevated stretch between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
"The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation took another important step forward in its Phase 4 construction work as the first pier of this phase of Metro expansion was cast on the Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg Metro corridor," the DMRC said in a statement.
This "major construction milestone" has been achieved, despite severe shortage of manpower and other logistical challenges because of the pandemic, officials said.
The average height of piers on this corridor is 10m.
However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the viaduct level is going to be at 28m, the highest in the history of Delhi Metro, the statement said.
Presently, the highest point is at Dhaula Kuan, where the Line 7 viaduct passes at a height of 23.6m.
Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.
They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand.
Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run.
Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.
The 28.92-km-long Janakpuri West-R K Ahsram Marg corridor is an extension of Magenta Line and will come up with 22 stations.
While 21.18 km of this corridor will be elevated, 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction work on this particular section had started in December last year.
On July 17, the work on the underground section of this corridor was commenced with the beginning of D Wall construction work at the Krishna Park Extension Metro station.
On 24th June, DMRC had started the casting work of u-girders which would be installed on the elevated section of this corridor.
Under Phase-4, 61.679 km of new metro lines shall be constructed across three different corridors comprising 45 metro stations.
These new sections shall provide interconnectivity among the already operational sections of Delhi Metro.
Out of this, 22.35 km will be underground while rest will be elevated.

At a press conference convened by the Council in Kaduna regarding threats that Shekau made in a video released by her, it was time for President Muhammadu Buhari to wake up to these challenges.
One of Nigeria's leading Islamic scholars, Sheikh Abdulwahab Abdullahi Mohammad, has challenged Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau over a video he released stating that if he is indeed brave, then he should come out from hiding and face security agents.

Nigeria receives support of $890 million to fight against diseases from 'Global Fund'.
The organization "Global Fund" has provided $890 million to the Nigerian government to fight diseases in the country.
These diseases include AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
Health Minister Osagie Ehanire made the announcement last week in Abuja.
Ehanire said the support would help improve the country's health sector, especially in the fight against these diseases that have persisted in Nigeria.
It will be recalled that in January 2020 the Federal Government announced that it would incur a debt of $890 million from the International Monetary Fund to curb the spread of disease in the country.
The government has said it will spend the money to fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis from 2021 to 2023.
The government says the fight against malaria will receive the largest share of the money, that is $417 million, that of HIV and AIDS, $329 million, and that of tuberculosis $143 million.
He added that the government has put in place measures to help it manage its finances more efficiently without anyone falling through the cracks.
Actress Spencer Grammer slashed outside Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK -- Actress Spencer Grammer says she was trying to calm an agitated man when he slashed her in the arm and stabbed her friend in the back Friday outside a New York City restaurant.
Grammer, 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend "did what anyone else would do in the same situation" and were "attempting to prevent the altercation from escalating" when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were eating at an outside table at The Black Ant in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood around 11:30 p.m.
Friday when the man ambled up and demanded to be served as the restaurant was closing down.
Grammer and her friend were hurt as they "attempted to break up a dispute between the unidentified male and other patrons at the location," police said.
The man ran away after wounding Grammer in the right arm and her friend in the lower back with an unknown sharp object, police said.
No arrests have been made.
Grammer, who provides the voice of Summer on "Rick and Morty" and previously starred on the ABC Family series "Greek," is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said she and her friend both expect to recover quickly.
Neither suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In her statement to Us Weekly, Grammer thanked the first responders and Bellevue Hospital staff that treated them and noted the "incredible battle" those workers have fought against the coronavirus pandemic.
"It was very moving for us to have the opportunity to thank them in person," Grammer said.
INEC To Start Voter Registration In 2021.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will begin voter registration in the first three months of next year.
The chairman of the commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, made this announcement in a press conference shortly after he appeared before the Senate Committee on INEC to defend the agency's 2021 budget.
He said they would spend a long time conducting voter registration where registration would be stopped with six months to go before the 2023 general election.
"Our commission intends to resume this work of voter registration in the first three months of 2021," he said.
Once we get back to work, it will continue to run for a year and a half, in short it would be almost six months before the 2023 general election.
He said, that when they returned to work, they would not just do it weekly or monthly, but instead, the work would be carried out continually, however, they would not do it hastily but follow it carefully collecting everything.
The chairman said that INEC was currently facing up to 1,700 court cases relating to before and after the 2019 elections.
He said, the court cases eat up their resources but even so they are trying to follow the steps the law provides in response to any lawsuit filed against them.
"Everyone going to court includes INEC in the case filed. We have about 1,700 cases from before and after the 2019 elections. We continue to use our limited resources," he said.
While he was defending the commission's budget before the Senate, Yakubu told lawmakers that the commission was planning to withdraw N5.2 billion from 10 billion naira in INEC's treasury to supplement the 2020 budget.
He said the 10 billion they were talking about was part of the commission's savings since it was launched in 2010.
He said the need to do so was necessary given the shortfall in the 2020 budget they received later as well as the problems it faced, including the fact that the Corona outbreak caused the commission not to get the full budget for 2020 as planned.
Regarding Nigerians living abroad, he said there is a law in place that allows them to vote during elections, adding that once the law comes into force they will be able to get the right to vote from the countries in which they are living.
Rep. Val Demings talks VP candidacy, blasts Trump for pardons
Congresswoman Val Demings (D-Fla.) was not shy about her willingness to serve as vice president under a potential Joe Biden administration as well as her sincere appreciation for being considered for the role.
In a live interview with BlackPressUSA as part of its #FIYAH!  Live series, the esteemed member of the Congressional Black Caucus shared her history and the work ethic and commitment that has brought her to this point, stating, "You all know my history.  I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor in Jacksonville, Florida."
Demings served as one of seven House Impeachment Managers during the January trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of the Senate acquittal, history will forever note that he is the fourth commander-in-chief to be impeached.
The former House Impeachment Manager, replied in a February interview with NPR from her Capitol Hill office, "Was it worth it?  Every day it has been worth it."
Adding, while the verdict was disappointing, Democrats had an obligation to pursue the case regardless of outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she objects to Trump commuting the prison sentence of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other felonies) as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes, stating, "The gall of pardoning your friends, those who lied and cheated to cover up for your wrongdoings."
Demings heads Biden's list of potential running mates along with CBC Chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Abrams, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and a few others.
She noted however, that just one person will decide who will run alongside Joe Biden this fall.
"That's Joe Biden."
Then, while laughing, she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream, adding, "If y'all want to make a call... go ahead."
There's no doubt that regardless of one's political leanings, history will look back on this period as a season of evolution in American politics and perceptions.
This fact was not lost on Demings.
She noted that having so any women in consideration for vice presidential candidacy represents an opportunity to break through what remains of the glass ceiling - particularly when it comes to African American women.
"These are the exact opportunities that I work hard for all of my life to create for young boys and girls who may have been told they're the wrong color, don't have enough money, or are the wrong gender," she said.
The congresswoman pledged to make sure that the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign advertise and to work with the Black Press of America to get as many as possible out to vote.
"I will make a call to [DNC Head] Tom Perez and I will put this on the top of my list," Demings promised.
She agreed it should be done now, rather than later in the campaign.
Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if defeated, and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself, Demings became animated, "To even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach."
"But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates the job.
It's not a job where you should be allowed to break the law and ignore the Constitution.
I think he hates the job, but he hates to lose.
I can see this president not wanting to leave the White House, but we have a way of taking care of that, and if that happens, I just want to be on the team that makes it happen."
International Court of Justice begins investigating the EndSARS protests.
The international court which judges those who commit serious crimes, that is the International Criminal Court (ICC), has begun conducting its first investigation relating to the disturbances that broke out over protests seeking to bring an end to the section of police force, #EndSARS, that took place across Nigeria.
The ICC's prosecutor's office testified in a statement that he released saying that he had received information about the alleged crimes committed during the protests which turned into violence and irreparable destruction of government and public property and assets.
Protesters have spent many weeks on the streets of the country's cities protesting in opposition to the abuse that police officers inflict.
About 51 civilians, 11 policemen and seven soldiers were killed, according to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari when he suggested to the international community how to overcome the problem.
For its part also the organization for protecting human rights, Amnesty International, says security forces opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring many.
Soldiers and police have all denied the allegations of Amnesty International, but the ICC has said it will release the results of its first investigation to the public.
The EndSARS protests, which began in Lagos and Abuja, also spread to other states of the country, before escalating into violence, resulting in the loss of lives and property in their communities.
Some suspected hoodlums took advantage of the protests to destroy government buildings and those of some politicians, particularly in the state of Lagos, in the southwestern section of the country.
Authorities deployed riot police to quell the incident, but violence continued to escalate as a result of the killing of protesters in Lekki.
Protesters have accused security forces of opening fire on them in Lekki, Lagos State, that is the center from which the protests are being directed, protests that left many people injured.
Some believe that the firing on protesters has contributed to the deterioration of the situation, especially in Lagos State.
It's really war!
Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's barrister for her Wagatha Christie battle with Rebekah Vardy
Mrs Rooney has asked David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy
After talks between WAGs failed, insiders are expecting dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity barrister acting for Johnny Depp in his blockbuster libel case to represent her in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday understands that Mrs Rooney has instructed David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy with allegations that personal information was leaked from her private Instagram account to a newspaper.
The news comes days after documents submitted to the High Court claimed that Mrs Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, suffered physical and mental anguish as a result of Mrs Rooney's allegations.
The papers say the 38-year-old mother of five "suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety which manifested in being scared to leave the house," adding that Mrs Vardy, who was seven months pregnant at the time, "was taken to hospital three times... as she suffered anxiety attacks as a result of the post and the repercussions of it."
As well as representing Depp in his libel action against The Sun over allegations the actor was a wife-beater, Mr Sherborne, 50, is acting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their privacy claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After mediation talks between the two WAGs failed, insiders are now expecting a dramatic courtroom showdown.
"If you thought the Depp trial was box office, don't underestimate this forthcoming WAG war," said a source.
"It really is war now.  Coleen will not back down, neither will Becky.  It will be sensational stuff."
Mrs Rooney claimed that someone using Mrs Vardy's Instagram account had leaked fake stories about her to a newspaper.
She was nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" after revealing how she had she spent five months slowly limiting the number of friends who could see her updates on Instagram stories until only Mrs Vardy's account remained.
Mrs Rooney claims she then posted a fake story on Instagram, which was later published in a red-top newspaper.
In her legal submission, Mrs Vardy, who has denied involvement, alleges that she was made to feel like a "scapegoat" after Mrs Rooney posted the allegations "in a calculated and deliberate manner that was designed to cause very serious harm and enormous distress."
But Mrs Rooney's team has challenged the claim, alleging that details of her anguish are a "PR exercise" that distracts from the facts.
A source said: "Becky's papers are a sideshow, it is all so spurious."
Mrs Rooney - who has four sons with former England star Wayne Rooney - is being represented by lawyer Paul Lunt, of Liverpool-based legal firm Brabners.
Mrs Vardy is with London company Kingsley Napley, but it is unclear if she has yet instructed a barrister.
A spokesman for Mrs Rooney declined to comment.
Friday prayers were held at the Hagia Sofia building
Thousands of people, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was accompanied by his son-in-law, the country's finance minister, attended Friday prayers, thanks to the country's long-running struggle by Islamic zealots.
The move comes after a court in the city ruled that the Hagia Sofia building should be re-converted into a mosque.
Opinions have differed inside and outside the country since the ruling.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has already expressed lack of endorsement of the decision to again turn the historic building into a mosque.

He has also vowed to work harder at his Genk Club in order to gain the trust of Gernot Rohr.
As for Rohr, he has invited Paul Onuachu, who is in the same club as Cyriel Dessers.
Abdulrashid Maina Was Granted Bail.
Abdulrashid Maina was granted bail on November 26, 2019, by the Federal Court in Abuja under Justice Okon Abang, but the lack of fulfilling the conditions of granting bail have resulted in his being remanded in custody.
His lawyers later asked for easing of the conditions for bail, with the judge agreeing to reduce the number of senators receiving his bail to one.
Barrister Mazi Afam Osigwe, one of Maina's lawyers, told VOA by telephone that his bail conditions were not met until Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, representing Maina's constituency, came to stand for him and then he was granted bail on Friday the 24th of this month of July.
Mazi added that he was not released until certain documents and rules of procedure were completed, then he was released, and that his client was now living with his family.
He said the trial would resume in September when the court would return from the holiday.
On October 25, 2019, the EFCC indicted Abdulrashid Maina, together with his son Faisal and a company named Common Input Property and Investment Ltd before the Federal High Court in Abuja under Justice Okon Abang, where they face allegations of corruption and accepting bribes in excess of billions of naira.
Communities are building culverts for themselves in Kano which cost close to N5m.
The people of some neighborhoods here in Kano have teamed up to renovate culverts that connects their areas.
The wards include Darma, Dukawa, Zangon bare-bari and one section of Sharifai.
During a visit to the neighborhoods, Freedom Radio saw for itself how the projects had progressed.
Mubarak Abba, one of the youth founders of the project, said from now on they would no longer wait for the government to provide such services.
How much will it cost to complete the project?
Mubarak Abba said they have carried out a number of community development projects but this is their biggest one they have done.
The project is expected to cost around five million Naira.
The way the work is funded is that the people of the area collect money from each other such that everyone donates whatever Allah gives him in order to carry out this work.
This is according to Muhsin Aminu Dukawa who is raising the money for the project.
Female parents also give their contribute to the project.
Female parents are not left behind, they also contribute their share.
Hajia Fadima Danbalarabe popularly known as Niniya is one of such mothers in the area.
She said they provide food for the workers and soap to wash themselves after the work and anything else that God provides them with.
How did community elders accept the project?
The youths who led the project said the project was only possible with the help of local ward heads and community elders.
Alhaji Lamin Isah, one of the elders in the area, said the culvert has been an issue for a long time, but now their children are tackling the solution to the problem and are able to solve it.
Religious leaders have been involved in the work. As the wards are involved in religious affairs, so the youths have put religious leaders of the area in the forefront of promoting this project.
Gwani Hadi Sadisu Zangon Bare-bari is a renowned Qur'anic scholar here in Kano who is involved in this work.
He said he is very happy that the youths of the area had approached him and asked him to advise them on the project.
How does the community view the project?
Patriots say this is what every society should continue to do to bring development to their areas.
Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim popularly known as the Gwamnati Ikon Allah is one of the patriotic people in Kano.
We call on other youths to follow the example of these neighborhoods because if we stand still waiting for the government to do this, we will wait endlessly and the repairs will not be done.
Current affairs commentators have long challenged the government on how almost every neighborhood suffers from such problems, and the government has failed to correct them, and now it has reached the point where the public has begun to take this kind of action to do the repairs on their own.
Nigerians are still facing very difficult circumstances.
The Federal Government of Nigeria and the states have so far claimed to have spent billions of naira to support the less fortunate, to alleviate the suffering caused by the Covid-19 virus known as coronavirus.
Ahmad Tukur Jada, one of the leaders of smallholder farmers' groups in Nigeria, described to the Hausa division the challenges faced by the poor in this time of pandemic, including the cost of living.
On the issue of corona support, he said they have seen nothing.
But as the masses are struggling, some agents and organizations are already looking for ways to support, to alleviate the suffering of the community.
Taraba State Member of Parliament Bashir Muhammad Bape told VOA that in his Nguroje constituency, they bought 60 motorcycles and grinding machines and sewing machines which were distributed to people so they could make a living.
So far, some markets have been opened in Taraba State but there are struggles over the fact that the prices of some basic commodities such as grains and metal which are in high demand are escalating.
I Faced Challenges Before I identified Zulum to Succeed me - Shettima.
Former Governor of Borno State and Senator representing Central Borno in the Nigerian Senate, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, has revealed in detail the challenges he faced before he was able to identify the elected Governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, as his successor to the state governor's seat that he will leave as per the 2019 elections. He said he was looking for a politician who was honest and trustworthy.
Shettima made the announcement while delivering a presentation at the Coalition of Youth Groups in Birnin Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi State, entitled "Youth and Family Development: Examples from the Great North ".
"Governor Babagana Zulum is a man of perseverance more than I am, and his election as successor is not a matter of personal preference, but rather of the people of Borno State as a whole," he said.
In that vein also, the former governor advised leaders in Nigeria not to forget that power is a trust given to man by God the King, adding, "also take it as a matter of time, and on the day of judgement you will be asked about everything you did during that time ".
In your position as a leader, you must be aware that you are a role model, and it is appropriate that we educate the younger generation for the future, because we can not be here forever.
Furthermore, Senator Shettima took a swipe at how some in people holding power support are misusing their opportunity, and he added, this has to do with power obsession.
On the other hand, he expressed serious concern for how some young people are living aimlessly because of lack of education or opportunities for self-employment.
He pointed out that there is the need for young people to strive for education, which alone will give them maximum opportunities to develop the country to greater heights.
Similarly, Shettima also called for improved domestic measures to boost the economy and reduce the problems of unemployment in the country as a whole.

Pedro Chelsea exit confirmed as team-mates 'serenade' forward in changing room send-off
Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has paid tribute to winger Pedro Rodriguez after making his final league appearance for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old penned a short-term extension to his contract to see out the season with the club but will join AS Roma on a free transfer upon the conclusion of the campaign.
The Spain international, who arrived from Barcelona back in 2015, has played a bit-part role under Lampard this season with only eight Premier League starts and 21 appearances in all competitions.
The Blues boss confirmed Pedro's departure after the west London club sealed a top-four finish with a 2-0 win over Wolves, with the veteran coming off the bench for his final appearance.
"Pedro has played his last game for the club," Lampard told Sky Sports.
"The lads have just pretty much serenaded him in the changing room and rightly so because of the career he has had generally and for this club.
"It was his last Premier League game, but the impact he has had here is huge.
I want to say a big thanks to Peds and wish him well as he goes forward.
"He is here for the remainder of games, but a big player of the club leaves and the spirit of the club I saw afterwards was pretty special."
Pedro tweeted a farewell message after the game via his Twitter account, writing: "My last game at Stamford Bridge.
Thanks to every fan for your support through these years, to the club for giving me the chance of being a Blue and to my team-mates.
You'll be in my heart forever.
Now let's fight for the FA Cup trophy!!!
BIG BLUE FAMILY."
The former Barcelona forward leaves after helping Chelsea since the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte and also won the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the Europa League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
Angler 'seen throwing beer bottle at seal' in Devon
An angler threw a beer bottle at a seal when it interfered with his fishing line, a charity has said.
Photos taken at Hope's Nose, near Torquay, appear to show a man hurling a projectile at the creature from a cliff.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the angler emptied the bottle and launched it, hitting the animal on the back.
Mr Kenny called it "appalling and inconsiderate behaviour."
He said he was collecting litter at the Devon beauty spot with members of the Seal Project conservation charity when he witnessed the attack on Sunday morning.
"The seal made an attempt to get the fishing line," he said.
"The angler finished his beer, drained the bottle and threw it at the seal.
"The bottle hit the seal on the back and it swam off."
Mr Kenny said that "fortunately seals are robust creatures," but said the seal was simply doing what was in its nature.
"By throwing a glass bottle at it you are stopping it from hunting," he said.
The Seal Project said it was "not an isolated case" and it had received "numerous reports of this aggressive behaviour recently."
In a Facebook post, it said volunteers had collected 12 bags of rubbish during Sunday's visit to Hope's Nose and observed "multiple examples of antisocial behaviour."
All seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and people are advised to stay away from them.
Opposition Parties in Niger Launch a Book about Mistakes in the country's Election Planning Processes.
Opposition parties in the Republic of Niger have launched a book containing details of mistakes they found in the planning of the country's elections, which will take place at the end of 2020, while the leaders of the Electoral Commission call on all political parties to work together to see that everything goes as it should.
The aim of writing this book named "Livre Blanc", is to raise awareness among Nigerien and foreign audiences about the state of the electoral process in Niger, which from another angle, becomes a way to enlighten the opposition parties' supporters, as their spokesman Maman Sani Adamou told VOA's reporter shortly after the launch of the 40-page book.
Implementing some amendments to the electoral commission and the electoral roll are among the demands that "the opposition continues to put pressure on," said Lawali Salissou Leger, a spokesman for the Moden Lumana party. He said the importance of these demands has reached the point where there is a need to stop and make the amendments.
It seems the opposition movement has begun to have an impact on its supporters, according to Ramatou Alele, one of the contenders in the MPN Patriotic Movement.
It is safe to say that preparations for the elections, which will begin in December, are well underway, with reports that show that Nigerien authorities have begun trying to give the International Organization of Francophones the task of editing the country's electoral roll, another step in the process of printing ballot papers.

Donald Trump admits he often regrets his Twitter rants
Donald Trump has admitted he frequently regrets the incendiary posts he makes on Twitter.
Speaking to Barstool Sports Friday, the President of the United States admitted that his unchecked retweets - which have included pro-white supremacist material - get him in the most trouble.
Asked by journalist Dave Portnoy if he regretted his posts, Trump answered: "Often, too often.
It used to be in the old days before this, you'd write a letter and you'd say this letter is very big.
You put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do that with Twitter, right?
We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls - "Did you really say this?"
I say, "What's wrong with that?" and you find out a lot of things."
Last month, Trump sparked fury after retweeting (sharing content from another account) a video of his supporters in The Villages area of Florida, with the elderly pair filmed exclaiming "White power!"
And in 2017, Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim tweets posted by Jayda Fransen, leader of far-right fringe political party Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the retweets that got him in the most trouble
Trump said: "You see something that looks good and you don't investigate it and you don't know what's on the helmet exactly, right, which is a miniature and you don't blow it up, it sometimes - I have found that almost always it's the retweets that get you in trouble."
The president often shares praise for himself, rants about his rivals and conspiracy theories with his 80 million Twitter followers.
Trump says Twitter helps him cut through so-called "fake news" reports on TV shows and newspapers he claims are riddled with falsehoods.
But the president's own lies have frequently come under the microscope, with Twitter now flagging up Trump tweets that are inaccurate.
Coronavirus row breaks out on bus as driver gets in fiery exchange over face masks
In the footage passengers and the driver onboard the Arriva bus service in Liverpool clash over the use of face masks.

The bus driver said: "It's not my job to ask everyone who comes on the bus about wearing a mask."
A witness said regarding the incident: "A man and an older woman started ganging up on her and a massive row erupted."
"The bus driver had to get out of his seat and came over to demand what was going on and he told one woman she wasn't even wearing her mask properly."
"That woman then stormed off the bus and said she was going to report the incident."
A spokesperson for Arriva said: "The safety of our customers and employees continues to be our priority.
"The wearing of face coverings continues to be mandatory for customers whilst using public transport (exemptions apply)."
"We have clear guidance and signage for customers in regards to this and all other social distancing measures in place on bus, via social media and our website."
It has been mandatory to wear a face covering when using public transport since June 15.

Seven Major Crimes Committed by the US May Threaten Global Security.
The unscrupulous behavior of the United States poses a serious threat to world peace and security.
At a series of high-level meetings to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations in September, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodrigurz explained this.
He said the U.S. government has committed at least some serious crimes that could threaten international security.
The first is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and threatening political security in the world.
Second, imposing sanctions on countries for no apparent reason is a threat to global economic security.
Third, the arms race is also a threat to global military security.
Fourth, delaying efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and threatening global ecosystems.
Fifth, the promotion of monopolistic ideology and threatening the protection of the world's ecosystem.
Sixth, cyber-attacks and threats to the security of sensitive international data.
Seventh and last, threatening international cooperation in the war against COVID-19 and thus threatening world health security.
In today's world, peace and cooperation are the roads to development.
Any ideas of selfishness, monopolization, arrogance, pressurizing one another, and conspiracies that will jeopardize international cooperation and undermine global security will never take root and history will condemn them.

It is possible that a person who has contracted Corona will develop mental health problems.
Doctors at the University College UCL in the UK explained that it is possible that a person who contracts Corona's might also develop mental health problems.
The leader of this research and UCL official Ross Paterson made the announcement saying that it is necessary to do further research to determine the extent of the weaknesses that the disease can cause in a person.
Corona Virus disease is one among the viruses that cause a person to contract a common cold, which, if severe, can lead to suffering from breathing difficulties, which is called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), as well as acute illness that can block the throat.
But Corona Virus is a new disease that has never been found in the human body.
Symptoms of infection include problems with the airways in the throat i.e. shortness of breath, high fever, severe cough, and sore throat.
Also if the sickness is severe, it can lead to a condition in which breathing becomes impossible, then to suffering with pneumonia, and if it becomes very severe, the person's kidneys will stop working completely.
There are some emergency measures which help avoid this infection, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water, and always covering the nose and mouth when sneezing.
Also always clean and cook meat and eggs thoroughly before eating.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on people to always keep a distance from those who show signs of illness, especially those signs listed above, and to go immediately to a hospital for treatment if you are unwell.
