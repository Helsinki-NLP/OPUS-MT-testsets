They have no medicines.
When will his new novel come out?
May comes after April.
I want Tom to tell me what he meant by that.
Who is in charge of this building?
Shut the door behind you.
One day apart seems like a separation of three years.
Are you lost?
My mother is a teacher, too.
Tom obeyed.
Did you receive the letter?

Do you want a new world to live in, mirror of your deepest and most truthful desires?
As far as I know, he is not married.
He needs help.
Don't forget that smoking is dangerous to your health.
They didn't run.
I keep nothing a secret from you.
Tom waited here for an hour.
I won't lose anything.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
We kept quiet in the room.
Peel two of the bananas.
Our long vacation has passed all too soon.

How far is it from here to the next village?
Help Tom.
My grandfather gave me a birthday present.
I wonder if I'll ever get married.
He was profuse in his praise of his teacher.
The forest is very thick.
Perhaps Tom can help you.
Many are convinced that he is resistant to advice.
She doesn't need to work.
I walked up the hill.
What have you been doing this week?
Tom isn't in.
Look at that tower standing on the hill.
I recognized her at first glance.
They angered me.

Mother prepared us lunch.
That helped.
She talks as if she knew everything.
There's hope for everybody.
Yes, he is Anthony.
I'm still thirsty.
I don't feel like studying science.
