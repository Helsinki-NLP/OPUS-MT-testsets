We need you.
Let's forget about this.

When you're beginning to look like the photo in your passport, you should go on a holiday.
Not everything on the web can be found through Google.
What was said by him?
Why don't we go outside so that we would be alone you and me?
Sami realized Layla was dead.

Stop hitting me!
Layla is a party girl.
We are not at the cinema.
I know her.
I saw Bob this morning.
It is unfortunately true.
Sami ran into a tree because he couldn't see a thing.
Sami smirked.

Have you done all your homework?
He's stupid and dishonest.
Are you Sami's daughter?

It can't be true.

Ten minutes after the knockout, the boxer regained consciousness.
I don't like egotists.

You should work hard.
I go to work at seven o'clock.
Show me what's in your pocket.
Did it snow yesterday?
Thank you!

What happened last week?
I'm not ready yet.

I'm sure Tom would never do that.
What's wrong with you?

He came to America via Canada.
Yep.
Is it a recent picture?
Bring your children along.

They believe it.
They're with me.
I know who it is you're looking for.

My father is an electric engineer.
Sami wanted to be friends with us.
I know him.

Did you have fun?
The doctor checked Sami's eyes.
You have to get on that bus to go to the museum.
I know you don't deserve that.
Man, I just saw it on the news! Damn, you're making me doubt my own eyes!
He told me he was going to America.
Where is Laurie?

I saw the man jump.
I can't do this work alone.
Let me think for a minute.
The old man died from hunger.
I did not mean to disappoint her.

Is Tom happy?
You could see blood everywhere.

The hills are bathed in sunlight.
Sami could face life behind bars.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I can send you my Berber dictionary.

We have no options but to continue.
Can you recommend a good place to eat Korean food?

Sit at the table.

I don't want him to know the truth.
He was not my teacher.
Tom runs very fast.
I'm from Australia.
We know that the Sun is bigger than the Earth.
Today I'm not feeling well.
Actually, that's why I'm here.

Which car is Tom's?
Most of the leaves have fallen.
I had a grand opening for the hospital last month.

In my opinion, he's right.
Please have someone else do it.
The Japanese like to travel in groups.
Wait for me in my office.
I understand what you mean.
We're just going to talk.
Let's take a look.
You are in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He had a blue jacket on.
The police gathered a lot of evidence from the crime scene.
Maybe he was sick.
It doesn't matter from where he comes.
What do you think you're doing?
Do you understand me?
I caused this.
Tom loves going out.
Sami's fate was in the hands of the jury.
Nancy looks so tired.
She is able to speak ten languages.
Only fifteen minutes.
This is the window he broke.
Tom is only a little older than Mary.
We discussed the plan with him.
What did you major in at college?
Don't say anything without thinking.
No one believed his story.
He was run over by a car.

See you later!
What does the word "get" mean in this sentence?
I walk every day.

Is anyone looking?
Thank you very much, doctor.
I should tell Jamal what I heard.
I don't have an excuse.
She became rich.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
You have to come back.
Say: the truth from the Lord of you all. Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve.
Sami disrespected Layla.
Fadil knew that police could show up at any second.
Where is the British embassy?
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.

Dania, go call Fadil.
Sami was serving a life sentence.
She put the magazine on the table.

They're homosexual.
When did the meeting end?
The thick fog made it hard to see the road.
Take your time, Yoshida.
It can't be!
She told me not to touch her.
Sami came to the clinic to see Layla.
I had better ask her.
Mariko speaks English well.
I don't care what anyone says.

Fine. And you?
This candle is not white.
Yesterday was my birthday.
She talks as if she knew everything about it.

"What do you mean?" Dima asked, but burped, for if he remained silent, this sentence would be too simple.
I tried to get Charles to help me, but he wouldn't.
Sami was having fun.
Take advantage of every opportunity.
Sami has grown too comfortable with his double life.
We ate a whole load of apples.
The grass needs cutting.
Show me how it works.
Either way, it's not important.
May I ask where are you going?
This is Tom's pet turtle. She's called Mary.
I wish summer would never end!
Sami wanted Layla to give him more money.
Do you speak English?
Sami doesn't have the right to do that.
All her cats are sitting on the roof of the car.
Sami was shackled to his hospital bed.

The bananas you brought to me last night were all bad.
Sami and Layla were swingers.
I want to buy.
I went to the wrong address.
I have no more than 1,000 yen with me.
Do you drink alcohol?
With cat-like grace he leapt toward the ledge, missed it and fell to the ground below.
Fadil was never there.
Fadil's mother characterized him as a good boy.
Is that too expensive?
"Where were you?" "At a meeting." "A meeting at the beach with Sami?"
My dream is to become a firefighter.
Sami continued to send letters to Layla.
Are you free tomorrow?

Stress can have an enormous negative impact on your health.
Why would we want to do that?

I love playing music with you.
He continued walking for a while.
Sami has realized that.
What do you like to eat?
Is that your sister?

I want to buy a gift for you.
Sami tried to escape from justice.

I wish I had more friends.
She waited for the bus.
Don't look at me.
What did you come here for?
Layla pulled at a gas station convencience store.
Sami met a Muslim woman online.
Do your own work.
This will be a very dangerous mission.
He decided to be a lawyer.
Sami was sleepwalking.
I listen to the radio every night.
Tom didn't want to go there.
She turned down his proposal.
We can't let this happen again.
The fog has lifted.
She is accustomed to sitting.
They slept in the same bed.
Sunday is not a workday for me.
The king crushed his enemies.
I have a daughter who's married to a Frenchman.
I disagree with you.
Do you go to Tizi Ouzou University?
Because you're a minor, you can't enter.
Be supportive.
Sami needed some money.
They can stay with us.
He has worked in France his whole life.
Let's go, Jamal.
I disagree with you.
I'm very happy to know you.
I made him paint the house.
The letter was to let her know that he had been ill.
I don't think that we will be able to solve this problem by ourselves.
Because it was late, Sami encouraged Layla to spend the night in his apartment.
Which country are you from?
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
How are you?
I can stay in the guest room.
I also found this.
My father is a civil engineer.
When did you get to London?
I always liked mysterious characters more.
Doraemon often smiles.
Take a look.

How many people did you tell?
Who are you, friend?
Is Jimmy writing a letter?
I entered the room, which was full of people.
I can't imagine my life without you.
Police thought of all possibilities.
Did you come here alone?
I was thinking of getting a dog.
Sami and Layla were planning to spend the holiday weekend together.
She said she was twenty years old, which was not true.
Fuck!
He is such a bad person that everybody dislikes him.
I can't live that kind of life.
As long as we live, we have to work.
Where did he get that sweater?
Living with Tom isn't easy.
Sami is going to give Layla some medicine.
His condition could have been worse.
Sami borrowed from his company all the time.
You'd better go by bus.
She's not the right girl for you.
Who's the boy swimming over there?
Sami changed the subject.
Tom wanted to buy Mary something special for her birthday.
Tom liked Mary's new hairstyle.
Your place is in this clinic.
"'Story'?" the woman asked. "What do you mean?"
I like the colors on this painting, but it's far too small for me.
Snow is falling on the mountains.
Don't pick your nose!
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me.
Don't you think it's too strange?
He accomplished the work as planned.
Why don't you come to work for this clinic?
I don't think he's coming.
How fascinating!
What's the purpose of your visit?
Layla was not in love with him.
Here they come.
I got wet to the skin.
He's kicking me!
May I use your pencil?
Sami was brought into the clinic.
I would love to write hundreds of sentences on Tatoeba, but I've got things to do.
I like this city very much.
I will not forget to write to my mother.
Sami jumped out of the second storey window.
Environmentally damaging projects should be abandoned systematically.
Who would like to do that?
Take it easy.
Please give me a glass of water.
He is a very smart boy.
You idiot!
The most perfidious way of harming a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments.
What does she think about my car?
At 8:30, there was still no sign of Fadil.
Are you the new assistant?
Their job is to do make-up for performing artists.
He is French.
People love freedom.
Once again.
He's at home right now.
Yes, that's my house.
Do you know the answer?
Workers in these factories comprise a large percentage of immigrants.
What time did you eat?
We should not be influenced in our decisions by our prejudices.
Leave it to me.
To be perfect she lacked just one defect.
The clinic was closed down.
You may come if you like.
How many days do you usually need to get there?
This Thanksgiving weekend, I have a surprise for Fadil.
You can stay for dinner.
Sami has stolen Layla's life.
I'll pay the bill.
See for yourself.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
Can someone open a window?
I think different from you.
You'll have to use the rear door while the house is being painted.

It's almost six.
My favorite color is red.
Sami is downstairs.
The paper is written in Berber.

You are eating meat.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
I learned a lot from you.

Fine, thanks.
His words and actions do not go together well.
Don't trample on the grass.
I'm stupid and I don't know why.
You make me happy.
Bless you!
Sami's cat was clawing Layla.
Thus he succeeded.
Sami feels so scared.
He'll have to forget about you.
Sami lived a glittering life.
Karam is a new teacher.
He is next to me.
Sami must have been scared.
The doctor is going to be here any minute.
May I ask a couple of questions?
Layla was asleep in her bedroom.
Arabic isn't hard.
What a big dog it is!
I think I need to talk to Tom.
Layla left Sami.
"Yes, that's me," said Al-Sayib. "But there's at least one of us in every country. And we all like Fanta, as well as putting noobs in their place."
Sami was playing a very dangerous game.
This is Tony's book.
For seven years, Fadil lived his dream life.
Tom thinks that Mary won't say yes.
Sami needs to eat.
Please take a bath.
Fadil wanted to incinerate Layla's body.
He became the company president when he was thirty.
I quickly ate lunch.
Since Mario lied to me, I don't speak to him anymore.
We encourage your participation.
I'm so fat.
It is not necessarily so.
Tom's hair is really short.
Sami suffered several severe injuries to his body.
Sami regrets it.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license.
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
He spun her around, took her in his arms, dipped her back, and gave her a big Hollywood kiss.
I don't work for nobody.
They believe it.
Allah knows.
The shop is closed on Sunday.
You ought to thank him.
That's very serious.
If you sign up to Facebook, your information will be sent to intelligence agencies.

Fadil introduced Layla to Rami.
Will you do the work that Seosamh didn't do?
It was awesome to meet you in real life!
Who's that boy?
Fadil told police everything.
Tom wiped the table.
Peter looks very young.
Whose son is Tom?
That's why I quit.
Carry the table out, please.
I know your mother.
Go fuck yourself!
I love her like a sister.
There's so much I want to say to you.
You must have been scared.
Sami is waiting outside.
Sami had another woman in his life.
Sami was in danger.
Change is the only constant.
I can't forget the day when I met him.
I will go to America tomorrow.
Remember your promise.
I can have so much fun just playing by myself.
What are you looking at?
He listens to a short wave radio station.
He works at a bank.
Sami converted to Islam in Ramadan.
I want a guitar.
I want to know who is coming with us.
This is the key that opens that door.
Sami watched that happen.
The houses caught fire one after another.
The sea is raging.
I think we should do some more.
We thought it natural that he should be punished.
What is your favorite music group?
They look American.
I advise you not to keep company with Tom.
Fadil stayed upstairs.
Tom never thinks about others.
These flowers have a unique smell.
You can ask him for help.
My language is very complicated.
You deserve it.
Sir, you have left your lighter on the table.
Egypt has the best food and the best music in the Arab world.

Sami picked Layla up from the airport.
He reached for the apple.
The party that we've been invited to is tomorrow, not today.
When will we stop sitting by and watching?
I should have done this years ago.
You just missed her.
As a matter of fact, I have had nothing since this morning.
Sami fell in love with a Muslim girl named Layla.
I cried out to you, hear my voice.
She's asking how that's possible.
It is a fact often observed, that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under other circumstances.
The school called today.
He made up his mind to keep his plan secret.
Layla shot Sami to save her life.
Sami prepared to leave.
I was wondering when you'd be back.
This book is difficult to understand.
Is this your son, Betty?
Layla was a busy mom.
Don't worry. I'll do it.
There is nothing to be proud of.
Sami watched Layla suffer.
Where is my car?
Please help me.
We met our teacher.
Let's get some sleep.
I'm still at the university.
She knows nothing about the birds and the bees.
Dr. Sadiq was a superstar in the community.

Interesting.
What would have happened if Peter Parker hadn't been bitten by a spider but a stoat?

He read the translation of the Quran in Hebrew in less than a week.
Can you sing the Argentine National Anthem?
I am a substitute teacher.
Don't trust anybody but yourself.
This is Tony's book.
Doesn't that bother you?
What's the purpose of your trip?
Where are you going?
The boy remained silent.
They don't pay me attention.
You must control yourself.
Tom has always had that problem.
The program will finish with the national anthem.
I'm gonna go back to work and earn some money.
I am telling you the truth.
Fadil was sound asleep.
Tom and Mary are playing poker.
I don't understand a thing here.
This car is bigger than that one.
Tom smiled.
Did you forget to greet me?
Sami told Layla that he had been waiting all his life to meet a girl like her.
Watch me now, Jamal.
I feel cold.
She hated her math teacher.

I want you to be better.

As a rule, I prefer people who deal with matters of this kind directly with those involved.

Why didn't you come?

I'm not a real fish, I'm just a mere plushy.
Fadil hunted around the house to find the money.
The landing was perfect.
He wants to meet you.
Come quick!
Sami knew who attacked him.
It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches, in numbers this nation has never seen.

Tom is a student.
I'm a free man.
She lies to you all the time.

Don't forget our date tomorrow.
My mother made me a cute skirt.
Is he speaking English, French, or German?
I think you went too far.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
Why did you go there without me?
Layla moved toward Sami and kissed him.
Sami felt bad.
Sami was at work when Layla called him.

You deserve those compliments.

Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.
Would you like to sell your car?
Do you have enough information to go on?
We put the world at your fingertips.
This afternoon we will have an interview.
My dog eats grapes.
Layla had messy short hair.
Eat whatever you like.
Obviously, he is to blame.
It's the wrong way to do it.
There were a lot of people in the room.
The dedicated bike zone is most often at the rear of the train.
Sami should listen to Layla.
I resigned.
Sami's son went to college.
The house was dead silent.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
He made a fool of his teacher.
Do you need an ambulance?
Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.
