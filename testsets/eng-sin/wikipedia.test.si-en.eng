The inner ear sits within the temporal bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth
All the canals in the inner ear is filled with fluids and it has a sensitive epithelial tissue and associate hair cells.
For example, the Valcan and the Romulan communities in the StarTrek  universe.

These ear structures are also caused by abnormalities of the temporal bone and ear canal, and this is considered to be related to nervous hearing loss and transmission hearing loss.
the earlobe helps to direct the sound towards the ear drum through the ear canal.
Workers who are exposed to loud noises without hearing protections have a high risk of having hearing damages.
When the loss of hearing is serious or longterm hearing aids or cochlear transplants  are done.

For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.
For this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut.
For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation.

However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in - fighting as well as out - fighting.
However, this was considered "unmanly" and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the seconds of the boxers.
If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout.
In addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury.
In General, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting.
Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system.
In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack.
It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.

The in - fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries.
The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one.
The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in.
The out - fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight.
The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.
There are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut.
There are various organization and websites, that rank boxers in both weight class and pound - for - pound manner.
The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw.
There is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others.
The rules were published under the patronage of the marquess of queensberry, whose name has always been associated with them.
The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to "lift" the opponent's body, setting it off - balance for successive attacks.

As a result, the phrase "wage slavery" is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labour.
A supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.
At Simple Reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given living standard; the stock of capital stays constant.
Balanced Economic growth requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions.
By its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price).
Capital and commercial trade thus existed for much of history, but it did not lead to industrialisation or dominate the production process of society.
Capitalism is an economic system based upon private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.
