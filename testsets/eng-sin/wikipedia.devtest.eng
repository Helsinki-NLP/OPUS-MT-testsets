Since Tutankhamun was still living, and because he is from the royal lineage, the queen Meritaten Queen  may have prevented his succession.

Marc Gabolde strongly believes that king Neferneferuaten and Meritaten are the same person.
Nefartiti was a name proposed for King Nefarnefruatan during the early days.

Most Egyptians admit that she is a woman and she is another Smenchaker's king.
In several of his papers and at least one book (written in French), Mark Gabold states that she is Meritatan.
Mark Gabold states that Tutankhaten did not reign over Amarnahi for more than a few months.

Miller states that the word ''Servant'' must have been used as a derogatory term and not literally.
Earlier it was reported about a clump of stone that included almost complete line diagrams of the names of Smenkhare King and his royal wife Great Meritatan.
It has been reinforced officially after the recent harassment.  
A similar situation can be found in the text related to Hatshepsut in Penyati's tomb.
without the grand children the age of her cannot be proved with evidence.
One can say that by altering the history to some extent, Marsuli is trying to transfer the whole responsibility of this deceit.
In this period, there are no instances where a long name is followed by the name 'Smennaker'.

If this is true, Smenkareh had no independent kingdom.
When Meritaten gave birth to a girl, Akhenaten may have then tried to make Meketaten his wife,
Merrit-Arton did not have a need to change the name.
As the Smennaker and Neufernerophutonism were suppressed,new interpretations of the evidence were carried out.
If this had her image, we could have understood how Nefertiti's image was altered to match the inscription.
If her entire figure had been restored it means that Nefertiti was replaced by Neferneferuaten.
In most of James Alan's works here are mainly essentially a Nefenereferthan woman and she is not another Smennaker, but described as another.

The word these contain "...Aknaatan's Priya" earlier crafted as Aket-En-Hayes or as "Active towards her husband".
A small statue found in the tent camp's tomb is also cited.
Due to this, it cannot be thought that this simple connection depicts a joint control every time.

In the representation of the Royal family, the name Nefertiti has been reinstated by the name Neferneferuaten, therefore it appears that the new king is Nefertiti.
This can be identified as a step bringing the arguement of the queen that reigned the state foward.
Reveres thinks Queen Nefertiti has managed somehow to independently rule the kingdom before tutankamun comes to the throne.

The cost insurance is a type of insurance which cover the cost during the period the businessmen who owns a cost insurance cannot engage with the business due to a state of incapacity.
Risk management is the practice of assessing and controlling risks.
The ultimate benefit is the claims and claims for compensation, the material usability of the insurance.
Insurance Funds - This is an insurance cover given together by the government and banks.
In fact, some policyholders have won when comparing to the insurer's.
It has been ordered by law that an insurance is mandatory to drive a vehicle in a road in the United States.
The Government has provided the National Flood Protection Program with the provision of this insurance cover to certain parts of the United States.
From the home insurance in America there is a small health protection for the owner, equipment and persons which will be harmed when inside the home.
In America the Standard type Insurance companies mainly insure the essential properties.
The regulations that affect insurance companies in America differ from state to state.
Those who are purchasing E and O insurance are real estate traders, house observers, and valuers and website developers.
The reason is that they are issued by insurance companies and are governed according to an insurance policy.
Not helping another person paves the way for the losing of help when you need help.
As an example a torched house was rebuilt with the help of everyone.
For example the insurance of a house owner covers instances where one is wounded due to slippling and falling in his premises and it is generally covered by the insurance.
For example, the insurance company seeks a high installment from older men because they can be at higher risk than young people.
For example, a company can obtain the burglary insurance coverage to cover the risk of losing money from theft or burglary.
One thing is when taking legal proceedings, for legal protection, if a payment is required to be paid according to the court order, it will also be paid.
One insurance policy can cover multiple risks.
In a way insurance can be defined as something which started simultaneously with the mankind.

Increase in profits and healthy economic environments have caused the growth.
The same policy is applied for every person for insurance schemes such as housing, vehicle and business premises. 
Dealers who transport goods by sea should pay a certain percentage of value of the goods.
That means the traders promised to pay more when the money is loaned and the loaner promised to cancel the loan if the goods were robbed.
Because of economic growth, control of inflation and growth in the stock market, the life insurance and general insurance both grew.
This is a essential by-result of insurance policy in evaluating the "risk in change" and in assessing insurance premiums.
Under the same condition, when paying for another person, the homeowner does not suffer losses when the insurance company pays the homeowner according to the request made.
Therefore, the same principle and the investment management entrepreneurial insurance are also applied here.
Also, these insurances provide facilities that general insurances do not provide at an affordable price.
The reason was that they did not want interest and application forms.
The reason is that the life insurance is a long term investment and other insurance schemes such as properties are limited to a period.
There are also instances where it is seen as a changed treatment of illegality. 
It provides a monthly relief in fulfilling responsibilities related to mortgaging and credit cards.
Even though it is important in writing, in Kiriāna there is no much of a difference.
It covers medical expenses in foreign countries, loss of goods, delays in journeys, personal loans.
It has evolved that it is different from properties and phenomena.
Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual.
Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity.
Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.

These tests were untimed, and given in a game - like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity).
The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.
This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, mood and addiction disorders, and depression.
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.
This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.
Threshold Theory - intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity.
Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.
To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.
To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it.

When compared to human raters, nlp techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality (when compared to human raters).
About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi - arid.
A sand sheet is a near - level, firm expanse of partially consolidated particles in a layer that varies from a few centimeters to a few meters thick.
A semi - arid desert or a steppe is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity.
As the desert mountains decay, large areas of shattered rock and rubble occur.
As the mountains are eroded, more and more sand is created.
As this wind - induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly across the surface of the ground.
At High wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, a process known as saltation.
Being Ectotherms, reptiles are unable to live in cold deserts but are well - suited to hot ones.
Berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells.
Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.
Cacti are present in both north and South America with a post - gondwana origin.
Cold deserts, sometimes known as temperate deserts, occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts, and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air.
David Faiman has proposed that "Giant" solar plants in the negev could supply all of Israel's needs for electricity.
Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for Agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation.
Deserts, both hot and cold, play a part in moderating the earth's temperature.
Deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges.
Deserts play a significant role in human culture with an extensive literature.
Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night.
Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields.
During a sandstorm, the wind - blown sand particles become electrically charged.
Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder Granites, limestone and sandstone.
Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes.
European interest in the sahara desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land.
Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants.
Former Desert Areas Presently in non - arid environments, such as the sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts.
For these reasons, the front line moved back and forth through hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained momentum.
Humans have long made use of deserts as places to live, and more recently have started to exploit them for minerals and energy capture.
In Common with cacti, many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals.
In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live.
In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover.
In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain.
In some parts of the world, deserts are created by a rain shadow effect.
In the first part of the night, as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day, they emerge and search for prey.
In the first world war, the Ottoman Turks were engaged with the British regular army in a campaign that spanned the Arabian Peninsula.
In the köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as bwh (hot desert) or bwk (Temperate Desert).
In the occurrence of precipitation, its intensity and distribution; and low humidity.
In the process they cool and lose much of their moisture by precipitation on the windward slope of the mountain range.
In the second world war, the western desert campaign began in Italian Libya.
Is Complex and dynamic, varying by culture, era, and technologies; thus the use of the word desert can cause confusion.
It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot.
Lakes may form in basins where there is sufficient precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above.
Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors.

One well - studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert - inhabiting species.
Orographic Lift occurs as air masses rise to pass over high ground.
Other regions of the world have cold deserts, including areas of the Himalayas and other high - altitude areas in other parts of the world.
Others occur on the eastern side of the rocky mountains, the eastern side of the Southern Andes and in Southern Australia.
Others store water in succulent leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers.
Other xerophytic plants have developed similar strategies by a process known as convergent evolution.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi - arid lands for millennia.
Plants face severe challenges in arid environments.
Polar Deserts (also seen as "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain.
Polar deserts cover much of the ice - free areas of the arctic and Antarctic.
Polar deserts such as mcmurdo dry valleys remain ice - free because of the dry katabatic winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains.
Potential Evapotranspiration, then, is the amount of water that could evaporate in any given region.
Problems They need to solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce.
Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.
Reptiles cannot survive at this temperature and lizards will be prostrated by heat at.
Rounded Mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.
Saguaro grow slowly but may live for up to two hundred years.
Sandstorms occur with much less frequency than dust storms.
Some major oilfields such as ghawar are found under the sands of Saudi Arabia.
Star Dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point.
The cultivation of semi - arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification.
The distance between their crests corresponds to the average length of jumps made by particles during saltation.
The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground.

Their self - sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth.
Their weight prevents them from being airborne for long and most only travel a distance of a few meters (yards).
The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation.
The largest of these deserts are found in Central Asia.
The Negev Desert, Israel, and the surrounding area, including the arava valley, receive plenty of sunshine and are generally not arable.

The Sahara is a very large expanse of land stretching from the Atlantic Rim to Egypt.
The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe.
The Saltbush in Australia has succulent leaves and secretes salt crystals, enabling it to live in saline areas.
These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction.
These include the great salt lake, Utah Lake, sevier lake and many dry lake beds.
These regions feature a semi - arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts.
The shape of the dune depends on the characteristics of the prevailing wind.
The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the martian polar regions.
The surface of the trunk is folded like a concertina, allowing it to expand, and a large specimen can hold eight tons of water after a good downpour.
The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, Ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards.
They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea.
They are often preceded by severe dust storms and occur when the wind velocity increases to a point where it can lift heavier particles.
They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low - lying areas.
They form downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle.
They have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day.
They limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata, by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves.
They occur in Namibia, Chile, Southern California and Baja California.
They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas.
They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth.
This area of deposited clay, silt or sand is known as a playa.
This is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.
This may have happened when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation.
When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind.
When They descend on the leeward side, they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation occurs.
When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side.
Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.
With few inputs, they were at the mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level.
AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the all - American team.
Additionally, some dives can be started in a flying position.
Adult Divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving.
A greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers.
All of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult / complex a dive is.
Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.
An alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation.
An armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver.
A number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills.
As the diver leaves the board, the total angular momentum vector is horizontal, pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example.
Attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries.
At the moment of take - off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution.
Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty.
Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.
Champions from each of these events have gone on to compete at the collegiate and Olympic Levels.
Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport.
College Divers interested in tower diving may compete in the NCAA separate from swim team events.
Competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group.
Consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements.
Despite the apparent risk, the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low.
Difficulty is rated according to the degree of difficulty of the dives.
Divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities.
Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements.
Divers who continue diving past their college years can compete in master s ' diving programs.
Dives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.

Diving is a separate sport in Olympic and club diving.
Diving is one of the most popular Olympic Sports with spectators.
Diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics.
Each dive is assigned a degree of difficulty (DD), which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken, position used, and height.
Each division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition.
Entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater swimming.
Entry to the water is invariably feet - first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head - first entry from that height.
For a five - judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the DD.
For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.
Free - indicates a twisting dive, and a combination of other positions.
Group d divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower.
High school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition.
However, man - made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations.
However, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms.
In Competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three - or four - digit numbers.
In Serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless.
In The Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors.
In the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving.
In The Republic of Ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the national aquatic centre in Dublin.
In the summer usa diving sanctions the summer nationals including all three events with both junior and senior divers.
In the transition between two positions the diver may for example bend their legs or curve at the waist, and points will not be deducted for doing so.
In The United Kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year.

Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet.
Master S ' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs.
Most divers have pre - dive and post - dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus.
National Championships take place late in the year, usually during November.
Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum.
One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.
Outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water.
Scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team's overall meet score.
Scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team's overall score.
Since the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform.
The ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training.
The body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side, and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive.
The competitive diver will attempt the highest dd dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores.
The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.
The diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.
The eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required dives and six optional dives.
The exact origins of the sport are unclear, though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races.
The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool, and they score the diver which is nearer to them.
The first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive.
The first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.
The Global governing body of diving is fina, which also governs swimming, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming.
The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list.
The latter applies only to platform competitions, whereas the other five apply to both springboard and platform.
The limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.
The NCAA limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions.
The NCAA will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.
The opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down.
The Raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted.
There are six "groups" into which dives are classified: forward, back, inward, reverse, twist, and armstand.
There are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful.
There is a general misconception about scoring and judging.
The result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers.
The rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry.
The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score.
These are currently the fina recommended minimum depths.
These competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school - age children.
These scholarships are usually offered to divers with age - group or club diving experience.
The soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height.
The third digit represents the number of half - somersaults.
The Tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist.
The total is then weighted by and multiplied by the DD.
They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive.
This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced.
This change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.
This is very painful and distressing, but not life - threatening.
This tradition evolved into ' fancy diving ', while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as ' plain diving '.
To win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet.
To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers.
Usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry.

After the death of Aknatan, she must have borne the post of Samaraj Yadikari/national captain for Tutankatan.
Since the names of the Kings of Amarna have been erased from history , the only ancient record containing information about this is the record of Manatho.
Her successors have used similar first names and she has not been given a royal burial.
Her strategy succeeds and a Hitait prince called Sanansaa, will come to Egypt and will marry her and claim ownership of the throne.
Her primal clergy may have been in the service of her hostel church, located at Thebes, the religious capital.
It is controversial that it was a co-governance of her state during which time it took control of it.
If they had added a new crown to her statue, it was a powerful testimony of the fact that Nefarti had acquired a new name and post.
Her age is not a barrier to that position, because Tutankhan has also become a ruler at that age.
Perhaps the authority of the ground was not in Akhenaten's hands at the time, but perhaps because it was in his mysterious co-ruler's hand.
Perhaps this would be a memorial chapel complex.
She succeeded him as an undefeatable empress in the name of Ancpheruru.
She seems to have a rather gentle principle about the Amun Priest.
In her royal cemetery, it mentioned that she died  during her childbirth.
After she was appointed to the throne after her husband's death she used the royal name Ankhekhepura.
It depends on her identity to indicate whether she ruled the kingdom before or after Smennaker.
According to Allen, if the female indicators are not taken into consideration, the above three names are known as the King of Neferneferuatan.
Alan suggests that she may have been a three year old at  time when she was first shown by Meketaten.
Very rarely, it can be seen that after these names with feminine characteristics, the term 'reasonable' has been used.
The Egyptians have tried to conceal the facts about the Amarna kings from the future.
Leading scholars among the Egyptians have different opinions about this.
The reason for that is, back then the goods contain name "Ankkeparure" declared as belong to Smenkre.
Each expert suggests different names to different people, and this debate is not yet ended
It is said that she (Hutsheppasut) died nearly that time.
If that were so, the scene here would be of another member of the Meritatan royal family.
It should be a few years after stopping the work at the cemetery.
Also, there are no 'short' named individuals with the name 'Nefereneferuatan'.
Later, during the reign of King Horyambe, the whole Amarna reign was subjected to disgrace.
Also she did not have the requirement to use a pharoh name such as dual Kartushaya in working on behalf of her husband.
It also portrays an offering of a sacrifice to the owner of the grave by him and his royal wife who holds the Meritaten position
There are hardly any evidence about Tutankhamun in Amarna city.
Hence, he must have taken individual control and changed his name to Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten
Eden Dodson's "Amaratha Sansette" book is considered as the most modern assumtion concerning the order of sequence and incidents.
On their side there are four cartouche with enough space to put the names of two kings .
His disclosures were later confirmed by James Allen.
After his death she took over pharaoh's power and ruled officially in the name of Ankhakeperure Nefarnefaruatan.
He said that the meaning of Ankhkheperure changes according to the way it combine with Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten.
In his book "Egyptian history" Kings were divided into dynasties.
He took over the name Smenkhkare along with her throne name 
However there there is no date mentioned in the scenery in Merirege Merirege's gravestone and there is no mention of Acknatan in it.
Gabold states that according to Smenkhare wine records, it can be seen that Smenkkhare suceeded to the throne after Aknatan.
Since Meritaten's name is depicted as the main queen along with Akhnaten's name in Tutankhamen's tomb, it is implied that she carried this position after Nefertiti.
An inscription on the priests found in the grave of Tutankhamun:
Due to the Tootenkamen lived up to this time and,due to he is a person from the royal family, the queen Meritatan might take actions to prevent his succession.
Dodson deduces that Nefertitt is the mother of Tutankhan.
Dodson writes: "... the next debate is clearly about her origin."
Dodson presumes that although she was senior, she might have nominally shared reign years with Tutankhamun.
But since she was unable to rule the state, she was brought down from office to king's wife.
But this object could have belonged to one of these two people.
But these images do not seem to be of Tutankhamun's or his wife's, it is  suggested that they are the images of Smenkhkare and Meritaten.
But at present his book cannot be seen , and only the quotations made by other writers to his books remain.
But the theory about the Smenkar's ruling period is still debatable.
Even though there were joint administrations in the New Kingdom, this is what Menon expressed about not having dual-dating (double dating).
If not, since Tutankhamun ascended the throne after her, his officers might have burried her with the funeral kit of another monarch.
Rewis sees this as an important part to solve Nefertiti's problems.
The successor of the Neferneferuaten erased most of the information about her from the history.
It can be seen that the Sub-king of Neferneferuaten had refused to gave her a royal burial.
Allen pointed out later that Neffernerophuton's opposals could be divided into three kinds
These are the evidence to prove the existence of Neferneferuaten, her gender and her identity.
Marc Gabolde is the person who strongly believes that the King Neferneferuaten is Meritaten.
Nefertiti was a previously proposed name for King Neferneferuaten.
Later, Marc Gabolde the French Egyptologist, noted that some of the features found in Tutankhamun's tomb were originally made for Neferneferuaten.
Since the (...) inscription is described in her years of ruling, she is believed to have often been alone in control
Most Egyptologists accept that she was a woman, and that she was not Smenkkare but another king.
Mark Gubbarld on several of her papers and at least on one of her books ( in french) has named herself as Meritaatan.
Mark Gubbard claims that Tutankhaman did not ruel Amarna for more than several months.
According to Miller, "It is written with the sad mood of incompatibility in this strategy.
According to Miller here the word " 'servent' is used in a more insulting nature rather than for its true meaning.
A similar situation can be found in the text mentioned concerning Hatshepsut in Penyati tomb
Without grand sons and daughters there are no facts to build arguments regarding her age.
One can state that Mursli is trying to cleanse history and putthe whole responsibility of this farce onto the Egyptians.
Though certain facts are accepted as the truth in this assumption, the argument for Nefertiti being Tutankaten's mother has been proven to be false. 
By this evidence is supplied for his short term ruling period.
The important factor in this theory lies on her name: it is not a very believable fact that a person changes their name to ascend the Nefernefaruatan position.
This shabert shape consists of two parts, while it is also said that there is another piece that fits between these two.
This helped dating ancient Egypt using a modern method.
This was used to represent Molinekia and her daughter.
This is a simple, rational thought used to describe the nature of different names.
Because of the repression of Smenkkre and Nefarnefruaatan theory like this,there is opening of paths to give new definitions to the evidences.
If her whole body was replaced here,it means that Neferneferuatan was appointed as king instead of Nefertiti.
Here the name Neufertener is used in place of Neuferteni
Although the child's names are not given, it is possible to identify the child as a girl
When considering the alternate meaning of this, it is revealed that there could have been an opposition to Neferneferuaten's appointment, or that the uprising of such an opposition could be expected.
These include "desired of the Aten" and "The Ruler"
According to this it is clearly evident that there were two co-rulers.

The NCAA will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.
The opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down.
The Raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted.
There are six "groups" into which dives are classified: forward, back, inward, reverse, twist, and armstand.
There are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful.
There is a general misconception about scoring and judging.
The rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry.
The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score.
These are currently the fina recommended minimum depths.
