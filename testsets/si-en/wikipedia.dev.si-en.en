The received oxygen is used at this point and metabolism breaks that into Carbon-dioxide.
Its base area has been produced upwards while the end has gradually narrowed down.
As a result heart beat is increased.
They are delayed by inflammation through the tubules that means that the sinusoidal duct will increase their lifetime during their positive loading.
They are connected to the conscience of the heart along with three frontal cusps known as the frontal, pre and lateral muscles.
Atria open to the ventricles through the atrioventricular valves.
The gland which is situated in between the auricle gland is called as the aural gland.
Because the atria and ventricles are interconnected, the relaxed atria collect blood during the ventricular systole.
Types of cardiomyopathy are described according to the nature they effect the cardiac muscle.
conditions that cures with time are called as mild conditions
Ischemia occurs in heart muscles when there is a blockage in blood vessels because of a damage in the tissue.
A coronary artery is a large vein that supplies blood to the right lower auricle.
Atherosclerosis condition also causes coronary artery disease.
Structure of the heart provides a significant limitation on making heartbeats, because collagen does not conduct electricity.
Mitral and tricuspid valves also close when the ventricle pressure is higher than the atrium pressure
Acute or cardiovascular disease, inflammatory diseases of the valves and other diseases(e.g.
When ventricles systole, blood flows to the pulmonary artery or the greater aorta.
When the ventricle relaxes , as a response to lowered pressure  the Pulmonary valve and aorta close.
When the ventricle relaxes, blood will flow from artery to the ventricle.
A special membrane called perkin fibers help to transmit this signal to the ventricle.
The time period which takes to fill the ventricles is a main reason which affects this. 
The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers
As the male has only a little time when the sacs are being rapidly contracted, the pre-load is small.
The pressure caused by the ventricle contraction opens up the aorta and the pulmonary valves.
In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis
Right auricle collects blood continuously from two main veins called superior & inferior Vena Cava.
The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle.
The right auricle and the right ventricle are connected through a tricuspid valve.
The right vessel runs through the right ventricle and the diaphragm, which is on the right atrium. 
Pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery
Now the oxygenated vascular blood moves through the veins and eventually moves towards the right heart along the veins and femur.
As with all cells in the body, it is essential to provide oxygen, nutrient and remove metabolic waste from the heart tissues.
This is hardly ever used at all as its specificity and sensitivity is low.
But, this would affect the size of the heart, the physical and mental conditions of a person, sex, contraction time period, preload and afterload.
But many other medical professionals also contribute to the treatment of heart disease.
A coagulation screen is often required to ensure that the right level of anticoagulation has been given.
This fluid can be removed through a syringe.
vascular resistance affects how much force the heart should use to pump bllod to the hear during the systole.
By the end of the fifth week, the septals is complete, and by the ninth week, the heart valves will complete forming
Usually, heart capacity is measured using echo-cardiogram.
The papillary muscles are connected with the valves from the  cardiac wall by a cartilaginous structures named cardiac tendons.
A person's pulse is usually determined by checking the rhythm and the strength of the pulse of radial artery which is located at wrist.
As the vibrations of the heart is transmitted to the chest It can then be heard by a stethoscope.
The pulmonary valve was placed inside pulmonary artery.
fluctuation of the fluid in the superconducting fluid is called a proton density.
A double membrane sac called pericardium  surrounds the heart 
when the muscle relaxes the calcium ions are removed from the protein.
When the cell begins to have sufficient charge, the potassium and the calcium ions enter or out of the cell.
These receptors help regulate blood flow.
Most of the times two tests are done for Troponin.
To learn the state of many heart valves and in treatment, blood testing is extremely important.
Even slight increases in Manya vein pulses are observed
The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle.
Heart tentacles and infantry are controlled by the intrinsic nerve and the closing nerve that influence the carotid centers of the heart and spinal cord.
Two openings above the aortic valve supply blood to heart muscle.
This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta
Those vessels are pulmonary vein, pulmonary artery and aorta.
There are four chambers in human heart as well as other mammals: right atrium and left atrium are located above right ventricle and left ventricle. 
A part of this is called the absolute refractory period.
After a short time the calcium tube closes and the potassium tube opens.
In contrast to this Fish have two heart chambers.
Consequently. the left atrium and left ventricle together is metioned as the left heart.
One example of a murmur is Citil's murmur.
Because of this oval hole, foetal blood can directly  flow from right atrium to the left atrium
Mitral valve is located separating these two chambers.
The process is called depolarization, which occurs spontaneously.
Conditions such as angina pectoris and heart attacks may occur due to this.
This suggests that the contraction force is proportional to the initial length of the muscles
The electrical impulses generated by this stimulates the heart to contract.
This re polarization duration is short and, the speed of depolarization and compression rises.
This cycle starts by the contraction of the atrium and ends with the loosening up of the ventricle.
This layer can be caused by blood from an injury or another liquid.
This Inflammation condition affects the functioning of the heart as a functioning pump.
This starting condition is very important for the development of fetuses and pre-conceptional development.
Due to this complex storm nature blood is pumped more effectively  into the heart.
This contracting cells connect to each other by Intercalated discs.
This signal travels through Bachman bundle to the left atrium.
This circulation involves a circular flow from a body and molecular biology pulmonary circulation, which is done by the lungs.
Due to this coordination the blood can be pumped to the body efficiently.
This structure is a tissue that cannot transmit the signals located within the heart.
Wrapped around these layers is located the double membrane known as the pericardium.
The impulses which travels through this are made through the systole pair in the spinal cord head .
These neurons form a network called neuroplexus which is located beyond the heart.
These nerves can affect the heart rate, but does not control it.
The inputs to cardiovascular center are received from different receptors.
When this becomes critical, conditions such as cardiac arrest and a sudden stop in cardiac output may occur.
This is an involuntary striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen
This is connected to the myocardium through a thin connective tissue.
This created and sustained by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in the wall of the right atrium.
This occurs after a short time after pottasium ions leave it
This is an oval shaped foramen located in fetal heart.
Surrounding this the pericardial cavity exists and also it consists of a pericardial fluid.
This pumps the blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system.
This is usually a deep rooted condition and may increase gradually with aging.
This is represented by the longitudinal sinus and posterior inter sinus on the surface of the heart.
This is described under the Frank-Starling mechanism.
Such abnormalities are often determined by an resonance examination.
To prevent blood flow from ventricles the aorta and pulmonary valves close up.
The inflammation here is known as pericarditis.
It will be investigated whether this will have a peak or any significant rise.
There are also three cusps, none of which are connected to any papillary muscle.
When the electronic signal move through the heart the heart muscle contracts.
It can be seen as coronary thrombosis here in the location of heart.
It does not have any confusions and will disappear in puberty.
More than three quarters of these are caused by coronary artery disease and stroke.
Therefore, there may be a heart failure in left or right side of the heart. 
Due to this the signal can only be transmitted through the atrioventricular node.
Because of this, the heart's function is affected by heart compression.
These are called as Left Coronary Artery and right coronary arteries.
These are slightly smaller than the contracting cells,  and the compression ability is limited since there are less number of muscle fibers.
For this coronary artery circulation is needed and it includes arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels.
This can lead to narrowing of heart valves or contractions ans relaxations of peripheral blood vessels.
Because of this a person's hands, joints and other faces will be marked.
Through blood transfusions, oxygen and nutrients which are required to metabolize the body's cells, diffusion from the blood, and carbon dioxide and waste are dispersed into blood.
Blood pressure is measured using a manual or automatic blood pressure unit or by using a more stranger measuring unit in the trunk.
The blood supplies the oxygen and nutrients to the body and, helps to excrete the metabolic wastes.
left atrium will receive oxygenated blood from the lungs through one of the four pulmonary veins
Mitral valve connects the left atrium and left ventricle.
The left atrium has an exterior sack called left arterial.
Same type of structure located in the left atrium is named as left atrial  device.
The left ventricle pumps blood into the body and to the aorta through the aorta valve.
The left vessel is associated with this third vessel, and it passes through the pulmonary arteries and the left Atrium.
Aorta branches into smaller arteries, arterioles, and finally blood capillaries.
Amplitude is the relaxation of auricle and ventricle and the instance where blood is flowing.
In the amplitude, when the ventricle loosen up, the atria compresses and the blood is pumped in to the ventricle...
the heart beat rate increase temporarily by exercising
Exercise and fitness levels, age, body temperature, basal metabolic rate, and even a person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate
In the respiratory process, carbon dioxide in the blood of pulmonary circulation mix up with oxygen in lungs.
The sino-cardiac throat contains a number of cells in the right-wall of the southern artery.
Sinoatrial node is located at the right atrium (at the right upper chamber of the heart). Near the connecting part of the upper respiratory tract.
Syno - Electric sign generated by the heart atrium knot travels in the radial path of right atrium.
During a Sino-cardiac digestive cell dysfunction, negative charges get collected on its membranes. 
Average pulse rate or the regular hear rate is called sinus rhythm.  
Normally it starts in the front of ascending main arterial and ends near the shoulder knot.
Usually right atrium and ventricle together known as the right heart,accordingly left side known as the left heart.
Normally, two sounds can be heard in a healthy heart.
A common rhythmic heartbeat is called the sinus rhythm, and it is established by the SA node which acts as a dynamic.
The electric activity of the heart can be measured by using electrodes on the surface of the body.
Other reasons are found by cardiac examination timely.
When the cell is highly charged, sodium tubes get closed and calcium ions begin to enter into the cell.
There can be no chest pain(Angina) or difficulty in breathing during exercise or rest or any disease feature shown due to stable plaques .
Common factors affecting the heart inactivity include coronary artery disease, valvular abnormalities, and heart muscle diseases.
Hear failure means the inability of the heart to pump adequate amount of blood necessary for the heart.
External methods such as heart catheterization are also important here.
When heart chambers get contracted, papillary muscles also get contracted at the same time. 
The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of a electric voltage in and out of the cell.
The cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat.
The stress of the hearts decreases, as the circulatory muscles relax, during the relaxation of the circulatory cycle.
Peptide can also be taken as a measurement for heart weakness.
Under heart examination, heart test, using hands to check the state of the heart and the use of a stethoscope to listen to the heart are considered.
There are only a few reasons identified that cause different age-related diseases in the heart muscle. 
The force generated by each contraction in the heart muscle is proportional to the preload
Two types of cells can be seen in cardiac muscles: within that muscular cells can be contracted easily.
The cardiac out put can be compliant according to the body surface area and,this is called cardiac index.
Heart sound should be tested in addition to diagnosis. 
Heart call is pathological condition of mild unusual heart sounds.
As these are extremely essential to identify heart diseases, they are called as live indices
The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors
Cardiovascular diseases does not show any prior symptom or may be it could be symptomatic, such as chest pain or short breath.
The heart has gets neural signal from the closing nerve membrane and the nerve sympathetic.
It is said that heart is the size of a squeezed palm.
Specialists in heart consultations are referred to as cardiologist.
As the heart is located between the two lungs the left lung is smaller than the right lung.
The heart is known as a muscular organ seen in humans and other animals.
Some diseases affect the pericardium which surrounds the heart.
Troponin can be considered as a sensitive indicator when determining if the blood flow to the heart is insufficient.
The upper part of the heart is a connecting point to several large blood vessels.
The upper part of the heart is positioned at the level of the third costal cartilage.
In deciding the conditions of the heart, a simplest method is to use a stethoscope to listen
If oxygenated blood flows directly from the right side of the heart to the left side, this can be identified at birth.
The under surface of the heart is located close to the spine while the frontal surface is located behind the sternum and costate cartilage.
The lower extremity of the heart is at the left of the sternum (like a centered line that goes.
Cardiovascular disorders which cause heart diseases is a major reason for deaths all over the world.
The heart's sinus rhythm maintains an acute heart velocity, and several factors affect this.
In all three layers  of the heart, there is a latent network called latrine in the bottom.
Even other blood tests are done to identify the risk factors affecting cardiac diseases and to understand persons' normal health status.
Specialist doctors that focus their attention on heart diseases are known as cardiologists.
Diagnosis of cardiac diseases is made by checking the history of the disease, doing heart test and through further investigations.
Well-practiced sportsmen could have a larger heart.

Usually when the emperor is male, the position of Huanhou (皇后) is given to his chief wife. 
Generally. it can be taught as connected to  high stress.
Obviously, He looks same as the prisoner of the palace.
Over the centuries, Emperor Wu was remembered as an example of possible mistakes in a woman's dominant position.
Due to expansion of civil service even the ordinary people can enter into state service and was able to gain an respectable post.
The historian of the Zong dynasty mentioned like this in his book, Sichi Tongjiyand.
Helan Minchi was deported and during that period he may have been killed or he may have committed suicide.
Animals who can tolerate extreme cold temperatures live in Tiga forests.
Epiphytics, lianas, mosses and lichens decorate stems and branches of those.
It can be seen in high latitudes and high mountain slopes .
It has been arranged in the manner of pine, canopy, sub-canopy and roof cover.
There are animals who have adapted to the environmental conditions in deserts.
The most highlighted fact is that winter is totally dark.
Among the bird species there are Macaws, Tucans, Eagles, and a giant pythons such as Anacondas can also be found in these forests.
Insects,lizards,rats,ground. squirrel,snakes,eagles,hawks like animals can be seen in deserts.
The conical structure helps to resist the wind and to make it easier for snow to quickly fall to the earth.
There are meat eaters such as leopard, tiger, bear and wild boar.
Evergreen oaks and trees such as Laurals grow in the water border.
While evergreen trees grow tall in tropical wetlands, vines and plants can be seen too.
It seems that Deciduous trees and coniferous trees mix and grow.
Reptiles like Python, Snake, Viper and birds like Peacock, Hawk, Jungle fowl, Owl and Eagle are commonly found.
The nature of the various types of plant associations on the earth, depends on various climatic features and interactions of various factors.
The floor consists with lots of degradable material.
Most of the time these type of forests can be seen in areas with "tropical wet and dry climate"
Many animals exhibit the colour of snow in the winter and brown colour in the summer. 
Can be found in the maritime areas of the Mediterranean climate.
seeds from dead grasses will grow well in the wet soil during rainy season.
Above mentioned plant reduces transpiration and shows different adaptations to store water in plants.
Although these grasslands are free from trees, trees can be seen in the waterways and forest boundaries.
These climatic factors are jet, light, wind, humidity, rainfall.
These major trees can be divided into sub-categories again.
These forests increases in biodiversity and abundance.
In addition to these plants, there are conifers such as Walnut, Maple, Cedar and Cypress.
These factors create the distinct features of a group of plants.
Plants in here are adapted to carry out the climate.
There are many evergreen plants here, and the deciduous trees can also be seen in the winter season.
The growth of plants and trees in this manner is known as ''plant succession''.
The trees that are growing under natural conditions of a particular area are called a "tree species"
All types of trees around the world, can be divided into three categories.
One can observe short trees, shrubs and grass where there is less rainfall and evergreen tree where there is more rainfall.
Plants grow well in the rainy season and shed leaves to take a break in the dry season.
It is difficult to access these because of the bushes and scrubs grow under huge trees.
There are lots of shrubs, such as Rosemary, Laurel, and Lavender, that have lots of flowers and fruity smell.
The plants are located apart and the special feature is that they are composed of deciduous trees.
The variety of trees and plants and the abundance of them are less than that of a tropical forest.
The nature of the plant's associations depends on various climatic features and mutual reactions of many factors.
There is evergreen forests and the characteristic of the forest is stratification.
Plant varieties such as bamboo trees, palm tree types, tulips, cotton, magnolias and camellias can be seen in areas that are bordered on the equator.
Due to the colder conditions in the temperate zone the trees shed leaves in the cold season.
Trees and plants grow without the influence of human are known as natural vegetation.
Then the work potential is transmitted to near by cells.
Then this signal travels through His bundle and through left and right bundles to the heart ventricles.  
nerves from the sympathetic trunk  increase the heart rate
The cells in the other cell-type conduction system are dynamic cells.
The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles
Ion transmission occurs from places where they are built up to where they are not.
In the upper right atrium, an auricular structure named right aural device can be seen.
Before birth, women and men have no difference between cardiac pulse rate
one valve exist between every atrium and ventricle and another valve exist within every ventricle
That is the inner most endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium
Those are, Interior serous tissue called Epicardium and exterior fibrous tissue.
That is epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium
That means when ventricles stretch more, it contracts more.
That is, the unique ability to begin a potential heart action at a constant rate. 
The increase in epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormone levels may also increase the heart beat rate.
This will allow potassium to move out of the cell.
Through this, the contractile impulse is rapidly transmitted from cell to cell and causes the whole heart to contract.
It begins to pulsate and circulate when embryo is in the third week.
The reason for that is to resist the high pressure occurs during the ventricle contraction.
The reason for that is the effect caused on heart muscles from exercises.
The reason is that more energy is needed to pump blood to the whole body.
It reduces the inactive pulse rate in the long term.
It begins to beat at the speed of the mother's heartbeat.
In that manner, muscles of the left and right auricles are contracted together.
In here,  oxygen flows into the blood and carbon dioxide is removed.
Here the obtained oxygen is used and broken down into carbon dioxide through metabolism.
Its base area is pointing at the top, and its tip is gradually thinned.
As a result, cardiac pulse rate increases.
What it means by them flowing via the errant canals is that when the sino - cardiac aural cells have positive charge in them the period that the "sino" stage prevails is increased.
The valves in between the arteries and ventricles are called the mitral valves.
As there is a co-relation between the ventricles and the auricles, the auricles rise and fill with blood when the ventricles contract in the systole.
Types of cardiomyopathy are described depending on the nature of their effect on the heart muscle.
Broken plaques will obstruct the blood vessels and the heart muscle would be affected by a condition of Iskemia.
A coronary artery is a large vein that supplies blood to the right ventricle.
Atharosklerosis state may also be a cause to create the coronary artery disease.
Structure of heart provides an important limitation on making heartbeats, because collagen does not conduct electricity. 
When Ventricles are relaxed,In response to low pressure, the arteries and the pulmonary valves are closed.
In the ventricles, the signal is transmitted by a special tissue called perkin g fiber.
The time taken to fill the ventricle is a main factor affecting his.
The right atrium continues to receive blood from the central veins, the two main veins of the body.
The right atrium and right ventricle are connected through tricuspid valve.
Pulmonary valve is located between the right heart and the great pulmonary trunk.
Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veinsthat ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.
Including all cells in the body, it is essential to supply oxygen, nutrient to the heart tissues and remove metabolic waste from.
The cretaceous screen is used to verify that the specified level of rectare has been given.
This fluid can be removed using a syringe
The vascular resistance affects the rate of pressure exerted by the heart to pump the blood in the leverage (echelon).
At the end of fifth week , septum get completed and, by the ninth week cardiac valves get completed.
The Papillary muscles join with the short valves in the wall of the heart through a cartilaginous connective structure named as chordea tendinea .
A person's pulse is usually checked by checking the radial artery pulse rhythm and strength near the wrist.
Due to the heart vibrations are transmitted to the person's chest then can be listen with a stethoscope.
The pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary artery.
Fluid can build up within the pericardial sack, referred to as a pericardial effusion
A double-lane strainer called an anthocyanin surrounds the heart, which is connected to the central arm.
During the relaxation of the muscle calcium ions are released from the protein.
Through a series of receptors, this receptor helps to regulate blood flow.
Mostly, there are two experiments conducted regarding troponin.
Testing blood is extremely vital for identifying heart conditions and do treatments
Mitral valve is located between the  left atrium and the left ventricle
The cardiovascular centres in the brainstem that control the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences to the heart through the vagus nerve and sympathetic trunk
The two openings which are situated above the greater aorta provide blood to the heart muscle.
Humans, other mammals and bird's hearts are divided into four: the upper left and right are atrium and lower left and right are ventricles
Part of this is called Absolute time.
After a short while, the calcium vessels close and the potassium vessels open up.
Similarly, the left auricle and left ventricle are sometimes referred to as the left heart.
Due to oval structure ,in the embryo heart blood can be directly passed from the right- atrium  directly to the left atrium.
By separating these two chambers is the mitre valve.
This can lead to an unstable umbilical incompatibility.  or heart attack.
This shows that the compression force is proportional to the initial length of the muscles.
This generates the electronic stimulus which allows cardiac contraction.
Anti-polarization time will be shorten by this while the speed of polarization and contraction will be high.
This cycle starts from contracting the atrium and ends with the relaxation of the atrium.
This fluid can be caused by the blood because of a wound or another pus.
This early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development.
Due to this complex hurricane like pattern the heart has gained the ability to pump the blood effectively.
These contractile cells are connected to each other through inter-fixed discs.
This circulation includes the systematic circulation from the body and the pulmonary circulation from the lungs.
Because of this coordination blood is pumped efficiently to the body.
This structure is a tissue in the heart which cannot transmits signals.
This is covered by a membrane called pericardium which consists of two layers.
The impulses that travel along these nerves are originated from a pair of cardiac tubule centres in the spinal cord.
These neves create a clusted of nerves at the base of the heart which is called cardiac plexus.
Eventhough these nerves affect the speed of the heart beat, it does not control it.
When it's aggravated, there may be conditions such as sudden heart failure.
This is an involuntary striated muscle surrounded with a collagen skeleton
This is connected through a thin tissue layer to the myocardium.
Creation and maintenance of this is done by sino-atrial node.
This also occurs a little while after the Potassium ions exit.
This pumps blood across the circulatory system through blood vessels.
Normally this is a deep roted condition, which can gradually increase with aging.
This is indicated by anterior longitudinal sulcus and posterior interventricular sulcus on the surface of the heart.
This is described under the frank-starling curve.
Such abnormalities are often determined by a re-acoustic cardiogram.
Pulmonary valve and greater aorta close to stop blood flowing again from ventricles.
The inflammation conditions caused  here is named pericarditis.
It is considered whether there is a significant growth in this.
There are also three nozzles, none of them are connected to any muscle.
Heart muscles get contracted when electric signals pass through the heart.
A three fourth of them were due to the coronary artery disease and Strokes.
Because of this heart failure can occur in the left or right side of the heart.
Therefore, the signal can be transmitted only through the atrioventricular node only
Therefore, the heart's function is affected by heart compression.
These are slightly smaller than the contracting cells, and as the muscle fibers are limited in size contraction is limited.
Scariose circulation assists this, and this includes the arterial, veins and lymphatic vessels.
For this heart strains become narrow (thanawaya) and peripheral blood vessels contract and rise as a result.
In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products
Blood pressure is measured by a hand operated or automated blood pressure meter or by designing an external measure higher than arterial pressure.
Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, and helps discharge metabolic products.
The left atrium connects with the left Ventricle through the Mitral valve.
Left atrium has an external sac calle left auricle.
The same structure that left can be found in the left auricle is called the left auricle device.
Left vessels joins with the third vessel and it runs along pulmonary artery and left auricle.
The aorta which is a large artery gradually branches into smaller arteries, arterioles and finally blood vessels.
Diastole is the process in which  atria and ventricles diastole and fill with blood. 
When the pressure within the ventricles falls below the pressure within the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves close.
by engaging in exercises, the heart beat rate will increase temporarily.
Rate of heart beat can be affected by exercise and fitness levels, age, body temperature, basal metabolic rate and even a person's mental condition.
During the process of respiration, the carbon dioxide in the pulmonary circulation exchange with the oxygen of lungs.
The sino atrial node is composed of a group of pacemaking cells found in the wall of the right atrium
The sinoatrial node is found in the upper part of the right atrium near to the junction with the superior vena cava
Sino - the electrical signal generated from the atrial node travels in an arial path along the right auricle.
Normal inactive heartbeat rate is known as sinus rhythm.
normally, the right atrium and ventricle together make up the right heart and the corresponding left side called as left heart.
Two sounds could be heard from a regular & healthy heart.
Ordinary rhythmic heartbeat is known as the sinus rhythm, and is established by sino-atrial knot that acts as a the pacemaker.
Using surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the electrical activity of the heart
Other reasons are identified by heart studies
Because of stable plaques  chest pain (angina) or difficulty in breathing during exercising or resting or any other symptom will not appear.
Common factors affecting the heart include coronary artery disease, valvular abnormalities, and heart muscle diseases.
Heart omission is the heart's failure to pump enough blood into the heart's necessities.
When cardiac chambers contracts,papillary muscles  contracts too.
Cardiac action potential is caused by the movement of an electrolyte between the inside and outside of the cells.
The cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat
The stress in the chords of the hearts decreases when the circulatory muscles relax during the relaxation phase of the heart cycle.
Brain-natural peptide can also be used to evaluate heart defects.
Under cardiac examination using hand to check the heart and listening to the heart using a stethoscope are included.
Should do a check in advance to determine the heart murmurs.
The heart call is a disorder or gentle abnormal heart sound.
heart diseases are most of the time are not infectious and factors like lifestyle and other factors affect this.
Cardio vascular diseases often do not show early complications,some times can see signs like chest pain and shortness of breaths.
The heart receives neural signal through the vagus and the sympathetic trunk
The heart is known to be the size of the palm.
Specialist related to heart diseases are called Cardiologists. 
Since the heart is between the two lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung.
A muscular organ found in humans and other animals is known as the heart.
Various diseases also affect the surrounding of heart which is pericardium (pericardium).
The upper part of the heart is the connecting point for several blood vessels.
Located in the  of the upper heart area.
Listening through a stethoscope can be depicted as one of the simplest methods to determine the condition of the heart.
If oxygenated blood mixes with deoxygenated blood in the heart it can be identified at birth.
The back surface of the heart is close to the spine, and the front surface is behind the sternum and the cartilage.
Cardiovascular diseases which mainly cause heart disorders was become a major reason for deaths all over the world.
Underneath every one of the heart's three layers, there is a closed network known as the plexus.
Other blood tests are also performed to understand the risk factors affecting Cardiovascular Disease and people's general health.
Heart diseases are diagnosed by searching the medical history , heart test, and by further research about it.
