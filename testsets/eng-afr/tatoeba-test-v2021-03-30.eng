I'm going to brush my teeth.
You can decorate the cocktail with a cherry or a pineapple.
When are you going to do that?
She'll try again.
Was the soup tasty?
What does he do?
Tom wasn't given the chance you and I were.
A lot of birthday cards will arrive soon.
He's a lone wolf.
Saturday is when my father is free.
What he said made us angry.
He doesn't just speak French, he speaks Spanish as well.
I don't think anyone noticed what you did.
That's a nice pair of legs.
One, three, and five are odd numbers.
Did they sign?
He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never cooks.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk proclaimed the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It's just not worth it.
We've arrived a little late.
No one will care.
Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The parcel weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
It'll be our secret.
This pencil is white.
He sometimes watches TV.
Drink!
Don't miss the opportunity.
It's a bit chilly.
He is better than me.
Tom showed me his new guitar.
It is easy to consider man unique among living organisms.
The sick person had the best of care.
You work too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not buying anything.
Tom wouldn't bother to lie.
"I have never thought about it", said the old man. "What should we do?"
Forget about them.
Tom didn't shoot to kill.
Mary is Tom's wife.
Where are the other girls?
Newspaper reporters were not permitted inside.
I like cold pizza.
He had no coat on.
He condemned racial discrimination as evil.
I drink water.
The food didn't taste that bad.
She is two years older than you.
I never said that.
I'm not blaming you.
She married him.
Were I you, I would start at once.
She has blonde hair.
Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you get back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot all about him.
The horse is in the forest.
More coffee, please.
Who's that woman?
All right. I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he's saying?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You should have attended the meeting.
Would you read my letter and correct the mistakes, if any?
My conscience is bothering me.
A lot of houses were washed away by the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick person folds one thousand paper cranes, her wish will come true.
Tom forgot all about them.
Don't be late for the train.
When you find something that you are good at and that you enjoy, it's a great thing.
You wouldn't believe me.
Tom won't be helping us tomorrow.
I was sorry to hear about her.
Whatever you do, don't drop your new phone.
Why don't you help me find some fishing worms?
This isn't a joke.
Tom won't be making any deliveries today.
The eye is the mirror of the soul.
The boy who writes best wins the prize.
Tom won't be staying with us next weekend.
I work at this company.
Tom can't swim.
You drink water.
She loves him.
Tom didn't leave.
Do you have a smartphone?
Do you know that boy who's crying?
Tom will help you.
You don't need a boyfriend.
Birds sing.
If the idiots would compete, you would be second because you are too idiot to be the first.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom didn't come.
I don't want to remember.
Lightning-fast!
They're in the library.
Tom had better not do that.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we will end up.
Tom got up early.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He didn't feel sorry for me.
What's your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Our teacher began singing a song well.
We won't be able to eat all this.
But you know well that this would have negative consequences.
He will never believe me again.
Tom turned on the right blinker.
The two towns are separated by a river.
We've decided not to fire them.
Can I get a coffee to go?
I met your girlfriend.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know anything about them?
Where is the PowerPoint presentation you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you get back to work.
I won't be bullied into doing that.
Everything we can imagine is real, but what is really real is the real question.
I live in Norway now.
Tom might not die.
I won't be able to help you.
No one tells me what to do.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can you write a letter in English?
My name is Tom. What's yours?
This is a souvenir from Hokkaido.
I've told you that before, haven't I?
Don't throw a stone at the dog.
This man's shouting at me!
Be more careful from now on.
Please go faster.
Where is the PowerPoint presentation you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The US will one day elect its first woman president, and there will be rejoicing in the long overdue occasion.
Thanks a lot, you just ruined my life!
We'll call you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I got letters from a person I've never met.
My dad's name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I am in a play.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak French well enough!
I won't be able to visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
A cat was on the table.
It was a humid, grey summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go inside.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I come over later?
Tom has been very tolerant.
I must go.
Tom wouldn't care.
Sami fixed that last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is ready.
I put on my socks in a jiffy.
Tom kept trying.
Tom won't risk it.
My horse is black.
If that's false, she's a liar.
I've been concerned about them.
My friend sent me a letter to find out how I was.
I'd like to mail this package to Canada.
Why does Tom have to do that?
Don't you add some sugar?
I don't scare easily.
She is doing her homework now.
What shirt will you wear to school today?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The walls were painted light brown.
You're afraid of him.
Tom won't see me.
Maybe I shouldn't be so suspicious.
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
He is a man of faith.
Tom won't die.
I don't want to see you.
He has a prejudice against jazz.
When was the last time you voted?
She is able to answer your question.
May I have a look at your ticket?
I wish you were close to me.
We think the reason for his success was because of hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I don't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams always come out differently.
Ping-Pong is also called table tennis.
I'm sure I won't be of much help.
The sky is blue, the sea is also blue. The sky and the sea are blue.
Robert was so busy he had to turn down an invitation to play golf.
Tom won't be here that long.
He is my brother.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
They're concerned about her.
The television costs more than the sunglasses.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
I'm used to it by now.
Can you make me a copy?
What's he doing there?
I'm finishing my homework.
Is it hot over there?
My house has two bedrooms.
Where's your luggage?
Who called these dead to dance?
Could you turn off the lights?
He reads the newspaper every morning.
She went on working.
He is young.
Tom was busy then.
Who had this ugly house built?
He can't speak much English.
I was just wondering if you have been able to find a place to live.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom won't back down.
Martha is an excellent pianist.
Let's stick to the point.
The news spread fast.
Do you have a match?
The thing that left the biggest impression from China, is the Chinese food.
Please hurry!
The dog jumped over the fence into the garden.
Can I take a day off?
The hot bath relaxed my muscles.
Read this book.
Does he write letters in English?
We have a big yard.
Don't waste your money by buying things you don't need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do it.
She has a house by the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
That's the last straw!
We know each other pretty well.
Thank you very much!
She looked ravishing.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He not only speaks French, but he speaks Spanish, too.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
There is always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money can't buy happiness.
Who said that? It's totally wrong!
Your name stands first in the list.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait that long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is pretty.
The sun having set, they left off their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She runs.
This factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that kitten?
He was a good king.
They said that they've always done that.
We are looking for each other.
I'm just looking.
I'm afraid Tom won't be able to come.
Tom said that he thought Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn't be surprised.
It is raining.
In the past, the boys were taught to fend for themselves while still very young.
Tom never would've done that.
There is a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
It was his decision.
I didn't really want to win.
I'm not afraid any more.
I had hoped we might become friends.
Tom is trembling.
My grandfather used to make furniture for himself.
He doesn't like traveling by plane.
We really have nothing to lose.
Sami is staying with a friend.
He asked my mum.
Does this make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
I am familiar with his music.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed at the direction of his thoughts.
No matter what you say, I won't change my mind.
That's pretty normal.
I love your son.
Tom won't be showing up at all.
I should have introduced myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to hide the pride he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said he didn't kiss Mary.
The bell is ringing.
We won't be able to get out of this cell.
I don't have time for you.
They said they've always done that.
My boss was satisfied with what I did.
I am a friend of Robert's.
I want to be her friend.
Don't move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember hearing about her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I'll be very careful.
Yesterday at this time, we were at the movie theater.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girlfriends.
Let's wait till he comes.
Tom dyed his hair dark brown.
That is what you get!
Will Tom die?
A dog was running after a cat.
I also kissed Tom.
Why don't you join us for dinner tonight?
This is a horse.
Tom was captured.
This isn't a joke.
You promised you'd come.
I'd be crazy to expect such a thing.
Santa lives at the North Pole.
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
I caught a cold.
Let's turn off the television.
I'm afraid I wouldn't be very good company.
You won't be able to help us.
You're the love of my life.
I thought you might back out.
Tom drinks more than anyone else I know.
I like leeks.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.
I've nowhere to sleep tonight.
I want Tom to go.
This song is easy to learn.
Where did you learn this?
You are stupid.
I forgot all about them.
She had chosen to succumb to parental pressure.
I have to help my mother.
He lives in a village near Osaka.
You are not a dog. Are you a cat?
What would you do if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be right back.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.
Sami should wait a little bit.
Are they friends?
Tom knows all about them.
It is risky for you to go into that area alone.
Sami hasn't noticed that.
Are you wearing gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my dad, do you?
I'll be right back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He is my neighbour.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel fronts the lake.
Tom's hands were cold.
She is well able to read.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a smartphone?
Mr Mitchel demanded that I pay the rest of the money by the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You are not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than him.
I put it back where it belonged.
I'm taking a book.
Tom left his phone in his car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a firefighter.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We aren't very hungry yet.
There is probably an easy solution to the problem.
I forgot all about her.
We've got to start doing that.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
How do you feel about her?
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot all about her.
Tom thought it was unfair.
I don't want to get married.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
He will be studying when you get up.
I have dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fighting lasted one week.
When was the last time you laughed?
Tom won't be making a speech today.
Why did you join the Army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You are too late.
What we know of health we have learned from the study of disease.
Tom sat by the window, reading a book.
We won't be here after 2:30.
I like to eat meat.
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you telephone him?
He's kicking me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is next to the butchery.
Please, forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food didn't taste all that bad.
I eat rice.
Excuse me! May I open the window?
This wall is taller than that one.
It's raining.
Tom will be late.
We dare you to cross that river.
I just bought a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The contest starts tomorrow.
They can overcome their fear.
This can't be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father has recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will beat you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom won't be getting any help from Mary.
I'm saving up so that I can go to Australia.
I know all about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he may say, don't trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up while it was still dark.
Find out all you can about her.
I've come to talk with you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we'd have to invent him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked my mom.
Late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and wet, and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing, especially at sea, a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board.
All cats are grey in the dark.
Quieter!
This is my home now.
A bird flies.
He turned up 30 minutes late.
He reached for an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
I wish you'd said that before.
I love my mum.
Tom won't object.
I'm a lot bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I am your father.
You will pay for it.
I looked for a place to stay.
Tom has a lot on his plate.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot all about her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities. Kyoto and Nara, for instance.
I'll make it back in time for supper.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you like.
This is really nice!
The river that flows through Paris is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally made it back.
