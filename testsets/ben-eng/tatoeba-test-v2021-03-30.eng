Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop screaming.
She doesn't like to leave anything unfinished.
Do you have a bigger bowl?
I found this book interesting.
I don't know the answer.
I love to travel.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
What does "Tatoeba" mean?
Is Tom well?
It seems that I've lost my keys.
Who sent you?
Stop that woman.
Did you read it all?
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Do you understand French?
I'll be back late.
Tom says he's going to resign.
Eat!
Tom's wounded.
Children love doing this.
I feel bad for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's the point in doing this?
What is the date today?
Good-bye!
She got angry.
I totally agree.
My father loves pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like apples.
Did you buy it today or yesterday?
Eat the bread!
What you said is not true.
They have two daughters.
Is there a discount for children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Watch Tom.
What's the price?
Don't look.
We agree.
Tom went outside.
Hi! How are you?
Tom certainly plays the guitar well.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
Tom threatened Mary.
Don't open that.
Come in.
Tom is teaching me French.
Do you mind my sitting next to you?
Then there is a problem...
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I just don't know what to say.
Yesterday was my seventeenth birthday.
Where would Tom go?
I'd like a luggage locker.
You must take this cough syrup.
Can you get a day off?
I'd like to change my ticket.
Tom is definitely not happy.
Eat anything you like.
They all screamed.
It's late.
Leave us.
I'm not thirsty.
I had a cat.
Don't stand.
What time does it open?
It's ours.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
May I look at your passport?
I'm at a loss for words.
How do you keep so calm?
Eat whatever you want.
Rome is in Italy.
Tom is tired.
I can manage this.
When will you return?
Can you speak French?
There is no way I'm letting you do this alone.
Mount Everest is, so to speak, the roof of the world.
I sat down.
Come back.
Tom tried to keep his chin up.
Tom's died.
Tom was crying like a baby.
Forget him.
I can't tell one twin from the other.
I'm reading your book.
Nothing happened.
He was speaking.
Can I eat?
Tom is taller than Mary.
The baby is screaming.
I always feel sleepy.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.
He spent the evening reading a book.
I've won.
Take my handkerchief.
I will not tolerate this.
Goodnight!
They all screamed.
Science has many branches.
No I'm not; you are!
Watch out for cyclists and pedestrians.
You are always complaining.
What for?
I'd like to open an account.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
French isn't difficult to learn.
I've got a cold.
I bought a pound of meat the other day.
Hold your tongue!
Is everything okay?
Lincoln died in 1865.
We have failed.
What is my room number?
He hasn't arrived yet.
Find Tom.
I don't want to go with you.
Hurry up, Tom.
The church bell is ringing.
Allow me to go.
I accepted his invitation.
They have twin daughters.
Do you have a car?
You are very brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bicycle?
The most important thing you can do now is to remain calm.
Where is the duty-free shop?
Look at Tom.
How many nights will you stay?
I go to school on foot.
My throat is a bit dry.
I have a new red car.
Call me.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
You're not the first person to tell me that.
She is eating.
Tom swims well.
Doesn't it work?
She doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Call me.
Do you have a car?
Do you eat meat?
Is there another way to get there?
Nobody here does that.
You're not paying attention.
Could you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please accept my sincere apologies.
Do you have anything to declare?
I don't understand you.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Is Tom all right?
You're doctors.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
What are you doing?
One language is not enough.
Don't move!
They yelled.
My father is always getting angry.
All Tom wants to do is fish.
He lives near here.
I like him.
That was important.
Tom kept his eyes closed.
Where are your things?
Tom squeezed the lemon.
How many people in your party?
You should sleep.
I want Tom brought here now.
He will be ten next April.
Tom continued yelling.
He knows where we live.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
You can eat whatever you like.
I worked as a waiter for three years.
Tom was there.
You run.
Kiss Tom.
We can't sleep because of the noise.
She can speak French.
I received your letter.
I agree.
I see.
Tom is not happy about this.
I like him.
You are rich.
I don't want to go to sleep.
My mother loves music.
Is this the way to the station?
Do you have a bicycle?
You are always complaining.
Do you eat meat?
My joints ache.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you play the piano?
Look at Tom.
I got a call from Tom today.
My hobby is listening to music.
I want to buy pineapples.
What's your name, please?
Don't yell.
This river flows into the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you yelling?
I like to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do all this alone?
I saw him running.
I don't feel like eating now.
Control yourself.
I know Tom was a friend of yours.
Stop gossiping.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
How can I get to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's yelling.
I'm a little busy here, Tom.
He's eating lunch now.
I found his house easily.
I give you my word.
That is mine.
We'll win.
You can eat anything you want.
I can't find my luggage.
When does the train leave for Boston?
How deep?
I ran outside.
I don't care what he does.
Here is your bag.
I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you all right?
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
Trust me.
I apologise for arriving late.
She can say whatever she wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
Are tickets for the concert available here?
Tom was talking.
I am your friend, right?
How long does it take to the train station by taxi?
Tom will scream.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
I'll be back to get you in 20 minutes.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
I accepted his invitation.
What's the meaning of that?
I saw Tom last night.
You didn't understand.
They all screamed.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Which tooth hurts?
The woman eats bread.
Tom wanted you to have this.
I've finished my work.
My father can fly an airplane.
Who doesn't want to win?
She eats fruit.
Attack!
Tom screamed loudly.
Tom said Mary had given him permission to leave early.
Is this book Tom's?
How tall you are!
It is midday.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps?
I heard yelling.
Are you coming down?
I'm lazy.
Tom lied about his age to get into the club.
You can stay as long as you like.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I didn't notice.
Do you eat meat?
I'd like a shave.
Don't stop here.
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
I want your opinion.
It is important to remember who your friends are.
This material stretches easily.
Could you please repeat what you just said?
I totally agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get lost!
Would you like to come fishing with us?
How old was he?
Tom is teaching me French.
It looked cheap.
Add more water.
I love to travel.
I shouldn't have logged off.
Why?
Tom is breathing heavily.
I know that we still love each other.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
What have you found?
Sit here.
The hospital is crowded.
She's asking how that's possible.
I told them to send me another ticket.
I don't believe it!
Tom'll speak.
She explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
Here is your bag.
Read this first.
How old is your father?
I found my mother busy ironing out some shirts.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not yelling.
What's the meaning of this word?
Wait outside.
Could you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I'm not denying that.
Puzzles are fun.
They need friends.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
Tom threatened Mary.
If he had taken his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't scream.
What is the next stop?
Why aren't you coming with us?
My throat hurts when I swallow.
I'm dancing.
We often eat together.
He's a doctor.
Is he American?
I'm pretty tired.
Tom died three days later.
Tom slept on the train.
I lost.
He speaks French.
How much is the bus fare?
The date and place of the meeting have been fixed.
Call my husband.
The government lightened taxes.
Tom stays with us.
What's your full name?
Tom used to play the guitar.
Rules are rules.
I will gladly help you.
Do you understand?
I don't know if I have the time.
How much does it cost to get in?
We want complete sentences.
I saw them.
He eats too much.
I'm a free man.
Tom lives there.
How do you keep so calm?
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
See below.
How old is the universe?
Somebody came.
Start now.
He tries.
You're probably wondering how I found out about that.
Don't stop.
Everybody saw it.
We're here, too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy books?
Do you know what he said?
How embarrassing!
I just ate.
Call the hospital.
My baggage is missing.
Let me speak.
The door is open.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father is going to China.
I haven't eaten.
Tom lies.
Don't underestimate us.
I'll be back by midnight.
Come with me.
Step aside.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Where's the knife?
That was an evil bunny.
I prefer black.
I am counting on you.
Do you have any cough medicine?
I'm only kidding.
They screamed.
She's asking how that's possible.
I forgot to telephone him today.
I saw him wash the car.
Tom sighed.
She is younger than me.
How long have you been living in Boston?
How can I get to the station?
Tom thought that the amulet would protect him from witches.
To me, it is easier writing about death than about life.
I heard you scream.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He hasn't come yet.
My father is at home.
Look! There is a cat in the kitchen.
I'm a student.
My father is frank.
I think you both know Tom.
How many nights will you stay?
I said nothing.
You ought to ask him for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
Everyone was screaming.
Who cares?
Hurry up, Tom.
We traveled in South America.
What's your favorite television program?
They've got guns.
My luggage is in the boot.
You really are hopeless.
What do you want?
He can say whatever he wants.
At what time does it close?
Nobody's there.
You need a friend.
My neck hurts.
Be quiet.
Contact Tom.
I'd like you to talk to Tom.
I respect elderly people.
Spanish is her native language.
They don't care.
When were potatoes introduced into Japan?
Tom has never been so happy.
Don't sing.
They need friends.
I heard you screaming.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Watch out!
No one man could do it.
I totally agree.
Which hat is yours?
She can say whatever she wants.
I only have one blanket.
Don't speak to Tom like that.
He was giving a speech.
What languages are spoken in America?
I teach English.
Let us in.
He was giving a speech.
She hasn't come yet.
Is that your book?
I was away.
Tom grew up in Boston.
There's nothing I can do.
Would you like some more?
It's already seven.
I haven't done this for years.
How much money would you like to withdraw?
Democracy encourages freedom.
I like tea.
How much is it?
I can beat you.
Tom shouted.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I can only speak French.
I don't want you to go.
My father is busy.
It's already seven o'clock.
I was in Rome.
Hurry up.
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
The police warned us to keep back.
You're a doctor.
Just try to keep calm.
I'm really happy for Tom.
What is his age?
I do not think it will rain tomorrow.
Could I have some towels?
It's not always so easy to do the right thing.
What time does the airport bus leave?
She can speak French.
This is your key.
I can't.
A car hit Tom.
How weird!
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
He can speak French.
One of the disadvantages of living alone is that you have no one to talk to.
Have you ever been to Boston?
That's a bad sign.
You can study here.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
Come at two o'clock.
I know Tom is tired.
I want some money.
Tom has died.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll keep watch.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Contact Tom.
It's been snowing all night.
Which floor is it on?
I need a taxi tomorrow evening.
I heard you screaming.
I don't see you.
I don't understand what you are saying.
What time do you go to bed?
You've got to do something about this soon.
I make €100 a day.
It's midday.
Turn down the volume, please.
Have you gone mad?
They yelled.
Turn left.
I hit Tom.
The library is to the left.
What's the meaning of this word?
Mary is screaming.
I teach English.
Eat whatever you like.
There's no doubt.
Children like cake.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Tom died.
Tell me which you want.
I still haven't found my contact lens.
Tom used to be scared of dogs.
Tom saw him.
Your bicycle is similar to mine.
Why do you want to leave today?
Sit down.
Drive carefully.
I watch television.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to have this.
What have you brought?
He told me he would go to Venice.
Please listen carefully.
Can you breathe?
He's younger than me.
I do not talk in Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It is midday.
What has happened?
I agree with you.
What is its cost?
How could they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What fun!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going on Monday?
They screamed.
Tom Jackson has written three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm just joking.
I'm not proud of that.
He runs.
The train arrived on time, so we didn't have to wait at all.
I am not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new girlfriend?
You may write in any language you want. On Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
I give up. No matter what I do, you never seem to be satisfied.
He can come.
He is a very important person.
This train stops at every station.
I didn't notice.
I'm not hungry now.
Where's the mistake?
I can't attend the meeting.
He's a doctor.
I'm getting off at the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You ought to ask him for advice.
Mark graduated from Harvard in 1991.
My son can read a clock.
I am looking for a good hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back at ten.
Don't delude yourself.
I don't want to look at Tom.
She is a doctor.
Goodbye!
You look sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I need to book a seat?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Waiter, please bring me some water.
Let's find out where Tom is.
My mother plays the piano well.
Can you speak French?
We're going to eat now.
We'll win.
I have been to Rome.
Will you fill out this form, please?
We saw it.
I'm happy to see you again.
They don't care.
At what age do you want to get married?
I was late to school.
Forgive Tom.
Who would want to hurt Tom?
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts.
Forget him.
I'm optimistic.
Tom kept yelling.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
He can speak French.
How old is this church?
I want to go to Australia once again before my passport expires.
Sit right there.
You may go there.
I don't want to get involved in that sort of thing.
How many nights will you stay?
Is your husband at home?
She can speak Japanese.
Tom is driving.
We love coffee.
Let's listen to what Tom has to say.
Tom loves me.
What did you forget?
I live here.
Tom has been crying almost every day.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
Tom brought this.
I like him.
I'll cook.
Could you repeat that, please?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Grab my hand.
How could they forget us?
It's because you don't want to be alone.
Would you like to come shopping with me?
How old are you?
Don't go in the kitchen.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit wherever you like.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We are Arabs.
Tom is wounded.
Where do you live?
Smile.
I lost your phone number.
Everybody's here.
Would you like something to drink?
I can swim.
Nothing remained in the refrigerator.
Nothing happened.
Everybody lies.
I am your friend.
Time is up.
Try hard.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
He was giving a speech.
I like him.
How tall you are!
I did my work.
I want the blanket.
I was coughing.
I'm not feeling well.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Aren't you a doctor?
I saw him running.
Tom is a boy's name and Mary is a girl's name.
Tom is in trouble, isn't he?
What's your name?
Let's head out.
How much does that cost?
Do whatever he tells you.
It seems to me that the train is late.
It is midday.
I have two nieces.
Keep it.
Nobody is speaking.
Tom is speaking.
I am sneezing.
What am I eating?
Keep Tom away from me.
What's your father's name?
I'd like to withdraw some money.

People from Madrid are weird.
Humans can't see ultraviolet light.
Let me speak.
Tom likes chess.
I would like you to come with me.
Tom frowned.
Tom got mad.
I don't like coffee.
Sit here.
Eat the bread!
I heard you screaming.
Call me.
Welcome.
I would like to buy some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this seat vacant?
We're winning.
My brother is two years older than I am.
Stop!
This hotel was built last year.
Eat everything.
I want a guitar.
Stop that woman.
What'll you be doing at this time tomorrow?
Don't speak.
You may write in any language you want. On Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
They live there.
This is her house.
Four hundred million people speak English as their first language.
This house is my grandfather's.
Where can I buy envelopes?
Forget him.
I've forgotten her name.
He eats nothing other than fruit.

Who ate?
Where can I buy tickets?
How old is your grandfather?
She can speak Japanese.

Tom likes chocolate cake a lot.
I'm going to go.
Have fun.
Last night I arrived late.
Have you got cough or cold?
Eat what you want.
Don't call me.
Is it far from here?
Where is the boy?
What time does the train for New York depart?
I'm exhausted.
I like him.
Do you want to learn French?
Do you understand what I want to say?
Nobody understands me.
Go away.
Niue is a country.
He's sleeping like a baby.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you help me, please?
She's younger than me.
Winning is never easy.
I'll arrange it.
Do you have time?
I've been hoping you would drop in.
Tom coughs a lot.
I am busy.
You may go home now.
He's younger than me.
I believe Tom is doing well.
I'll return to Australia in two days.
Tom told Mary that he was going to kill himself, but he didn't have the courage to do it.
Would you like to come fishing with us?
Although it is not a bad thing in itself, in a lot of cases, many people are watching too much television.
You ought to ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I have a cold.
I apologize.
I'm still your friend.
I can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
Drive carefully.
I eat.
I don't want to go shopping alone.
What is the distance from here to the station?
She got sick this weekend.
Tom kept knocking on the door, but nobody came.
He is a doctor.
Stop yelling.
I have a headache.
Go to the hospital.
The ambassador returned.
Pass me the salt, please.
The pen is broken.
Tom always keeps his promises.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
I refuse.
Wait outside.
I'd like a taxi now.
Keep quiet.
Who's she?
It has happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
Let's give it a try.
Tom's tired.
Do not forget about us.
Tom continued speaking.
I am south of the north.
You look very tired.
Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
He is eating.
She got sick this weekend.
I'll see you next month.
We need to get in touch with Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that magazine?
At seven I'll be back.
Is the lake deep?
I was late.
Call Tom.
What is the price?
Tom saw him.
What time's your plane?
Tom is tall, but not as tall as I am.
That's my wife.
I'm not very good at swimming.
Where is the tourist information office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
She didn't tell me her name.
Well, see you later.
Do you live here?
What's happened?
The room charge is $100 a night plus tax.
I'm not very good at French.
My father is going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want this.
I am your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll assist you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was concerned.
There's one cup on the table.
I'll be back within an hour.
I need to get off this ship.
That's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim smiled sweetly.
I don't live in the city.
Women change the world.
Please hurry.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Tom began screaming.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
This will cost €30.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
I like yellow.
Tom has decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you shouting?
Could I have the check?
Do you have a larger size?
Tom earns twice as much as me.
I want this.
I guess you don't need my help.
Tom waited outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the museum open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Are we eating out tonight?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom has been hurt.
He coughed.
Is my laundry ready?
Where can I buy it?
I need to send a fax.
He eats too much.
He taught me how to write.
Call my husband.
I used to be able to play that song.
I was astonished.
Where's Boston?
Call us.
The rules are simple.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're in better shape than I am.
He hasn't arrived yet.
I can't bend my right arm.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
Tom seemed quite surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married.
Success depends mostly on effort.
Tom laughs a lot.
Tom shook his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I found my shoes.
I was amazed.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
Do turtles have teeth?
Communications broke down.
Can I get a blanket?
Have you ever broken a bone?
I want to get off at the next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Really?
He hasn't arrived yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I want to say?
Have you ever ridden a horse?
He was speaking.
I have two nieces.
What are your thoughts on that?
I had nothing to say to Tom.
Try hard.
Tom laughed.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in America?
I'm exhausted.
She has two daughters.
I'd like you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his promises.
He is an experienced teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom's here.
Everybody desires happiness.
I forget your phone number.
Tom lost.
You are tired, aren't you?
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Go.
Everybody saw it.
What time does the bus leave?
Since Tom was speaking in French, I couldn't understand what he was saying.
I want this guitar.
She is a doctor.
What's your father's name?
I want to know who started it.
Don't go in the kitchen.
Don't move!
May I eat?
Who ate?
Any child can do that.
Tom doesn't want to see you.
Eat something.
The war ended in 1954.
She's my wife.
What's your age?
We wanted to talk about Tom.
Do you understand me?
Buddhism originated in India.
He's sleeping like a baby.
Why do you want to leave today?
Why are you shouting?
I asked Tom where he'd gone.
Happy New Year!
"Do you speak German?" "No, I don't."
Tom doesn't use Facebook.
Everyone was satisfied.
How much does it cost for one person?
Would you like to come inside?
Start now.
What time does your plane leave?
I'll be back by evening.
Stay here.
Say it.
Come with me.

He eats nothing other than fruit.
I can swim across the river.
I agree completely.
Tom saw it.
How many nights will you stay?
She acknowledged having made a mistake.
I don't know anything about Japan.
I was very scared.
Tom shouldn't have left the window open.
Water is life.
I was astonished.
Tell Tom.
I don't like this.
I usually eat outside.
Call the doctor!
Why did this occur?
Go over there.
Tom is a Canadian citizen.
Take it.
Tom saw them.
It's pitch black outside.
My father loves pizza.
Do you have time?
Tom's yelling.
Wake up.
Can you speak French?
Look there.
Tom saw it.
The balloon will burst.
He can read.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
There are too many things to do!
I'm not a bit tired.
I haven't tried.
I don't care.
I don't want to go alone.
You may go there.
My motorcycle is new.
Maybe it will snow.

How did this get started?
I like him.
I want to improve my Italian.
She has two children.
Leave Tom.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
Everyone changes.

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
Tom coughed.
When is the museum open?
He's eating lunch now.
What does this mean?
Where's the entrance to the museum?
I want more.
I heard screams.
Call the police!
Valentine's Day is celebrated all around the world.
Everyone's there.
Who's she?
Where do you want to go?

I see something.
I need ice.
I'll come along.
She has two daughters.
Do you eat meat?
French is my native language.
This book is also available in French.
You look sick.
You can't lift the piano.
Eat the bread!
I couldn't stop myself.
No one will know.
Tom tries.
He is an experienced teacher.
I'll buy it.
Tom kept knocking on the door, but nobody came.
In life there are ups and downs.
Are seats available?
Do you understand French?
You're in no position to make any demands.
He eats nothing but fruit.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Don't go.
Don't sing.
Would you like to dance?
How's your daughter?
Where can I claim my luggage?
Tom now knows everything.
Stop here.
The reservation is already made.
Your time is up.
There's no way I'm going to leave you alone here.
Speak with me.

Watch this.
Tom told me all about you.
Eat the bread!
I have caught a cold.
How much do I owe you?
She got angry.

London is the capital of England.
I couldn't stop.
He lives near here.
You were Tom's only friend.
Tom kept an eye on the children.
Would you like some more?
It's very hot inside.
Sit down!
Do you understand now?
I'm not cooking.
I heard coughing.
That's rather amusing.
There's a mistake in the bill.
I'm speaking.
I'm pretty tall.
It's hot today.
I saw him jump.
Why are you screaming?!
I don't know who killed Tom.
Is he a teacher?
I don't want you to go.
Go over there.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
She's a good person.
Go.
They quarreled.
Tom resumed speaking.
Did you get Tom's message?
I'm ready to begin.
I am staying at a hotel in New York.
Who are we?
Earthquakes and floods are natural disasters.
Who wants some hot chocolate?
I don't like you anymore.
It is midday.
Leave it.
My back hurts.
My mother tongue is Japanese.
They screamed.
"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
You are tired, aren't you?
Are you all right?
What do you want to be?
Give Tom a kiss.
I'll stay here till you get back.
Is this your car?
Let me go!
He speaks French.
Why are you screaming?!
Don't fight.
I'll certainly come tomorrow.
What time do you eat lunch?
Stop shouting.
Come again.
I like rice.
Please speak slowly.
You can eat all you want.
They have twin daughters.
They yelled.
A lot of people attended Tom's funeral.
It looked cheap.
This is my daughter.
Can it be phrased in another way?
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Do you still read books?
He came.
Where is the entrance to the museum?
You ought to see a dentist.
When do you want to go?
I'm cold.
Tom is hurt.
I'd like a taxi at nine in the morning.
I believe in you.
We're inside.
Very well. And you?
Ken beat me at chess.
What time do you usually get up?

Is he a doctor?
Everybody ran outside.
Tom doesn't have any proof.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
How old are you?
Good morning, everyone.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I've been there.
Who are those guys?
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He decided not to go to the party.
I don't know.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom isn't at home.
I'm not sure as to when he will turn up.
Tom came right away.
Tom was such a happy person.
We were studying all afternoon.
My knee hurts.
Help us.
He stood up.
This is your key.
I know that story.
He runs.
I can come at three.
Please eat something.
Sit down.
Does Tom help Mary?
You are not eating anything.
He can come.
Listen.
Tom ate breakfast alone.
Let Tom speak.
Tom is 100% correct.
I thought Tom was in Boston.

I'm going to Hokkaido.
Drive carefully.
Who are you?
Don't underestimate me.
I'm able to swim.
Everyone is tired.
I didn't complain at all.
All three have resigned.
It's a pity when somebody dies.
Tom hardly ever keeps his word.
He knows where we live.
I have two nephews.
Don't underestimate me.
Take us there.
Your bike is better than mine.
I am not feeling too well.
I go shopping every morning.
That book is written in French.
I don't want to go to work.
Tom doesn't want to hurt us.
I haven't slept.
You didn't understand.
I'm checking out.
Mr. Suzuki studied French before he went to France.
Where is the bus terminal?
You are not eating anything.
You are in my way.

Walk more slowly.
If the world weren't in the shape it is now, I could trust anyone.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I did not understand.
Close the door when you leave.
To me, it's important.
I have a good French dictionary.
Please put the meter on.
What happened?
I have nothing to declare.
Stop right here.
Trust Tom.
Tom will speak.
Would you like to come in?
I don't want to eat anything right now.
I'm still your friend.
Tom will never be able to keep up with us.
This is a hospital.
Consult a doctor.
What a lovely day!
The woman is eating bread.
Do you know what he said?
I'm screaming.
I want to ask Tom something.
I signed the contract.
You must show your passport.
Your daughter is not a child anymore.
I left the door open.
Where is the entrance to the museum?
Nobody lives there.
I came back.
I think Tom is Mary's older brother.
Tom is going to sing.
They're moving toward us.
Get some sleep.
My father is a teacher.
Ask again later.
I will return to Australia the day after tomorrow.
Everything has its limits.
Even Tom was somewhat impressed.
We both know that's a lie.
Answer me.
Do you need a deposit?
Do you want to eat now or later?
The experiment failed.
I can't live that kind of life.
I will go on foot.
Americans call football soccer.
Try hard.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
Stay there.

Come at two o'clock.
May I talk to Ms. Brown?
Tom doesn't look very happy.
I am eating a cucumber.
Control yourself.
Tom is coming.
Tell me which you want.
Eat the bread!
It is just a matter of personal taste.
Nobody understands.
Come again.
I would like an air-conditioned room.
He was speaking.
Go home.
Is there a hospital near here?
You can dance, can't you?
Sit there.
Tom worked there.
How old is that?
Stand up.
I'll be back in a month.
This is my brother.
I am your friend, right?
Call the hospital.
I'm awake.
Tom was crying last night.
He's kicking me!
I was negligent.
It's almost six.
I met a guy named Tom in the park.
Kiss Tom.
We're screaming.
How much will it be?
My name's Tom.
Turn right at the next corner.
I want time.
I like both.
It's too low.
Do you have a vacancy?
Tom tried to keep his chin up.
She's asking how that's possible.
Go inside.
Don't ask.
I thought Tom would love it.
Patience is essential for a teacher.
She explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
You can dance, can't you?
Come here.
Please wake me at six.
You deserve the prize.
Tom kicked Mary.
What are your thoughts on that?
The hospital opened last month.
There still weren't any visible signs of spring.
I'll stay here until ten.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
I forgot his phone number.
Tom stopped screaming.
This tape recorder will make it easier for us to learn English.
I don't know who killed Tom.
Your answer is right.
Who wants tea?
Do you have any vacancies?
Stop here.
Wait over there.
A lot of people say Tom is the best player on our team.
Someone screamed.
I've forgotten his name.
Tom keeps his word.
She knows where we live.
Australia is rich in natural resources.

I can go.
Finish it before you go to bed.
When do you usually go to bed?
What's the admission charge?
He is a doctor.
Is it a direct route?
Don't fight.
Please show me the green shirt.
Everyone screamed.
Who is she?
I'm pregnant.

I'd like to confirm my ticket.
Is this enough?
I want to cry.

Good night.
Can you get my bill ready?
I'll call first.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Tom has decided to keep a diary.
Nice to see you again.
Tom rides a scooter.
I suddenly feel very much alone.
It was entirely Tom's fault.
How far's the airport from here?
We write our own songs.
You called?
Tom has given us so much.
Show me a cheaper one, please.
Don't speak.
What's this?
I'm quite tired.
There was a bridge there.
How do you write your last name?
You are my daughter.
He stood up.
How long does it take from here to the station?
How do you pronounce this word?
Do you have any cough medicine?
I'm not your enemy.
Tom saw it.
I found my hat in Tom's car.
We have to try.

I feel well.
Help!
I stayed.
Welcome to Wikipedia.
I don't know what you mean.
Tom coughed loudly.
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.
He told me he would go to Venice.
Tom's dead.
He looks pale.
He tries.
Don't you forget that.
You can stay here as long as you like.
They say love is blind.
Consult your doctor.
Who'll drive?
Are you doctors?
He told me he would go to Venice.
Their parents tried to keep them apart.
I will be late.
Good morning!
Help!
I like maths.
Is this your book?
I won't lie.
Answer me.
Everybody saw it.
What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
Just sign here.

We're trapped.
It isn't mine.

They yelled.
He lives near here.
Stop yelling.
This is very good soil.
Are those yours?
He is having lunch now.
Stand up.
I am coughing.

I get it.
It is very near.
I've made that same mistake.
Hello, how are you?
Tom saw you.
Do you have any others?
I don't see you.
Tom was shouting.
What are you talking about?
Winter is coming.
Susan was terrified.
I forgot his phone number.
Don't shout.
I understand.
Take me to the hospital.

Are you all ready?
Tom ate.
I'd like you to talk to Tom.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
Anybody can make a mistake.
Is this book yours?
I like to eat apples.
That's the difference between you and me.

Tom understood.
Forget him.
Stay there.

Those two pieces fit together.
Don't sing.
What's up?
That's MY line!
I like yellow.
How much does that cost?
Can you recommend a hotel?
May I see your passport?
What is the time now?
I want to buy a pineapple.
You go first.
The summer vacation is over.
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
Get lost!
How long do you study French every day?
Are you sick?
This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
I am able to read English.
I understand your language.
Of course!
I don't think Tom likes you.
Are your hands clean?
The room was filled with cigarette smoke.
The servants' screams awakened everyone.
They visited me occasionally.
We would like to stay here tonight.
Step outside.
Tom is screaming.
Who wants to talk to me?
Nobody was injured.
Visit our website for additional information.
You're screaming.
How old are you?
Consult your doctor.
Do you understand what I mean?
Those who want to stay can stay.
Don't call me.
Leave us.
I don't know if I still have it.
This drives me nuts.
I'm starting to learn French.
I'm bad at sports.
I didn't hit anybody.
Try it.

Welcome.
Tom tried.

Where are the photos?
What'll Tom bring?
What's your full name?
How can I get to gate A-1?

The glass was broken by someone.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
The students laughed.
Tom's shy.
There are three buttons.
I found no shoes completely to my taste.
I'm catching the 11:00 train.
Tom kept knocking on the door, but nobody came.
She can speak Japanese.
I've given up on trying to surprise you.
Tom's an irritating person to work with because he'll never admit it when he's made a mistake.
Speak!
Oil floats on water.
Got it?
Tom is in heaven now.
Never mind!
We are lost.
Do you have a car?
Stop Tom.
Tom lives here.
Who wrote the letter?
I want to hear who won.

It's what I'm used to.
Take good care of yourself.
Hit Tom.
I asked Tom where he'd been.
Leave Tom.
He has two daughters.
That's mine.
You look sick.
I'll never tell.
The road was very bumpy.
I can speak Chinese, but I can't write it.
Why don't we go home?
What actually happened?
The pillow isn't clean.
I want to be more independent.
It doesn't surprise me.
They're inside.
I yelled.
I haven't downloaded the file yet.
You called?
I have returned.
I'm ready to go.
Why are you shouting?
Why are you shouting?
Tom began screaming.
Can you wait a minute?
We were waiting for them.
Tom's injured.
I missed my stop. How long does it take to reach the next stop?
I'm OK.
Come outside.
What's your name?
They say this old house is haunted.
That is my brother.
I'm still your friend.
I have three options.
Wash before first wearing.
They seem American.
"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
I've forgotten her name.
Are you all ready?
I would like to eat now.
Of course.
I heard three explosions.
Sit there.
Call us.

Do you have something to declare?
Some beaches had failed to comply with environmental regulations.
He had one daughter.
What will you eat?
My watch isn't working properly.
How old is Tony?
Tom's dreaming.
I love you.

We're stuck here.
No one is laughing.
What a scream!
I'm too busy.
There's no more time.
Everyone knows it now.
Tom is yelling.
I can only speak French and a little English.
I saw him jump.
I eat pasta.
You run.
Show me.
You need a new girlfriend.
She's my wife.
It wasn't until I heard him speak that I recognized him.
Mary ran.
He has two daughters.
Are you there?
Where can I catch the bus to the Tokyo station?
Can I walk there?
I never liked biology.
What's this called in French?
I haven't forgotten.
Do you know what he said?
Do you have my book?
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
Tom kept an eye on the children.
Would you like to come?
Are you worried?
She went to Paris to see her aunt.
I can manage it.
What does the word "Tatoeba" mean?
Leave me.
It is mine.
I've forgotten her name.
I've studied it.

I'll pay the bill.
My hip hurts.
We like coffee.
Santa lives at the North Pole.
Tom is also a vegetarian.
Tom came back to Boston last October.
I screamed.
Let's see what Tom is up to.
Is this your car?
Get Tom.
What was inside?
The bus stop is five minutes' walk from here.
How much did you eat?
I got it.
Got it!
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
Got it?
Tom certainly isn't as smart as Mary thinks he is.
Your book is on the desk.
How are you, Mike?

Leave me.
Coffee keeps me awake.
I am working.

How is your daughter?
Tom will return tomorrow.
Everyone saw it.
I used to play tennis.
She eats nothing other than fruit.
Stop there.
I'm coming back.
Stop!
Hold my hand.
Do you want to eat now or not?
Let's talk.
There's room inside.
I had a horrible dream last night.
Just try to keep calm.
Don't you think that Tom is a little young for you?
Keep Tom inside.
Spanish is her native language.
Refrigerators help to preserve food.
I will be back soon.
He only eats fruit.
She was raised in France.
Show me your passport, please.
How do you keep so calm?
Open your mouth!
Tom teaches me French.
I'm reading.
How can I get to the train station?
What is your father's name?
I am eighteen years old.
Don't scream.
Take me to the hospital.
You go first.
You called?
They all screamed.
You go first.
Anyway, if it just stops raining, then we might be able to go out.
Calm down.
You ought to ask him for advice.
I tried.
Who are you?
Tom's injured.
I'm not jealous.
School starts next week.
I don't get it.
Never mind!
I was there.
Who is he?
Does this bus go to the museum?
I'm clean.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
You shouldn't have gone into the forest alone.
I wanted five pineapples.
I thought Tom was different.
My stomach hurts after meals.
I am your friend.
How did you come to know her?
How long have you lived in Boston?
Tom's strong.
No way!
Bring it closer.
What am I writing now?
No one laughed.
He likes Italian food.
Do you have this in any other colors?
Can he speak French?
We've found Tom.
I was negligent.
Do I have to change trains?

I don't want Tom to find me.
Look who's here.
I can ski.
Tom was arrested for drunken driving.
Tom and Mary both are artists.

Ask again later.
That's rubbish.

What is the meaning of this word?
She is having lunch now.
Good night!
Go inside.
Keep an eye on the door.
I am a doctor.
He hasn't arrived yet.
I changed my name to Tom Jackson.
I'm reading your book.
Go.
I'm just looking around.
Here is your key.
He decided not to go to the party.
The museum is closed now.
My arm hurts.
Everyone saw it.
Like it or not.
He's sleeping like a baby.
Who are those guys?
Do you understand what I want to say?
Could you speak more slowly, please?
It's still mine.
Don't come.
You're not going to get away with this, Tom.
Tom's sick.
You may choose whichever you want.
Tom was helping me.
Forget him.
Let's wait here.
What time does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
Tom keeps his word.
I'd like you to call me Tom.
Tom bought some potatoes.
Tom is wounded.
You go first.
We've just had dinner.
School begins tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What floor is it on?
Football is a sport.
The sky is clear.
Hello!
I really appreciate your kindness.
He told me he would go to Venice.
What is your phone number?
She walks.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Stay here.
Have I arrived too late?
Forget him.
I can't say.
Language is a means of communication.
Tom knows it.
I never listen to Tom anyway.
What time does the next train leave for Tokyo?
Tom is taking a big chance.
Are those yours?
What are you talking about?
I will work.
What is your name?
I agree with you.
You are rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to go swimming.
I'm not the owner.
Many thanks.
She hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
There's so much I want to say to you.
Snow reflects ultraviolet light.
Step outside.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Don't you have a bicycle?
I'm not sure as to when he will turn up.
You're screaming.
He coughed.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everybody saw it.
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
My son came to my room.
I'm a student.
I'll be present.
Do you have your passport?
Please correct my pronunciation.
Do whatever he tells you.
You look very tired.
Tom started to scream.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's just wrong.
Tom always keeps his promises.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We'll just have to ask Tom to do it for us, won't we?
Could I have these clothes ironed?
I am going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for that.
Someone coughed.
I went to the bakery.
I learned to live without her.
My father is very nice.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Please hurry.
Tom was very busy with work.
I'm not proud of how I acted.
I yelled.
We'll work.
He came.
I don't agree with him.
Come towards me.
I'm screaming.
My watch isn't working properly.
Forget Tom.
What a nerve!
Is this Tom's book?
He got angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
It's time to go.
He neglects his studies.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy foods.
My mother loves music.
He loses his temper easily.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Whose is this?
Can I work here?
One problem still remains.
My hobby is collecting old bottles.
I like math.
I don't want to go.
When does the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bicycle?
Would you like to come?
My mother can play golf very well.
She knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom isn't here now.
Come again?
He acted as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come quick!
Stop shouting.
Was Tom there?
I donated blood this afternoon.
My back still hurts.
Where's Tom gone?
They seem American.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted her invitation.
My father drives very well.
I'll get lonely.
You need friends.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his last name is Jackson.
You've known Tom a lot longer than I have.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My luggage hasn't arrived yet.
Tom isn't here yet.
Please wait till he comes back.
Tom hardly ever keeps his word.
Eat something.
Is anybody home?
What do you do?
I think Tom is doing well.
Where can I get stamps?
I'm going to scream.
Can he speak French?
Tom may not want to do that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Would you like some more?
Another day passed.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where do I claim my baggage?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who would believe me?
She is a doctor.
You may speak.
I deserved that.
Nobody is indispensable.
Do you live here?
Everyone else laughed.
How many nights will you stay?
Have you ever seen the person in this photo?
I lost my luggage.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom up.
My son is studying economics.
From the look of the sky, it may begin to snow tonight.
How much will it be?
You know very well what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop coughing.
I just want Tom to be happy.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
Why are you yelling?
Stop Tom.
My elbow really hurts. I guess I should go to a hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Is Tom home?
Tom always keeps his promises.
I eat pears.
I'm your friend.
How long did you stay?
Who has come?
A river separates the city into east and west.
Come and see for yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom also plays guitar.
Do you have any plans right now?
He's eating lunch now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You ought to ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much are these potatoes?
What is the charge for extra luggage?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
Please hurry up.
Eat anything you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken a bone?
She got mad.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right foot.
I have a dry cough.
How old is your grandfather?
May I ask a question?
What's that?
Here is your key.
We've seen worse.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He is eating.
Rabbits like carrots.
You didn't understand.
My jaw hurts.
Sit at the table.
She is younger than me.
What is your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
May I use a credit card?
Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
This book is only available in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay by credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to the Jacksons' house.
She was wearing a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone screamed.
Is there a discount for students?
I eat noodles.
Tom is in the house.
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
Would you like to come inside?
Speaking.
We like playing soccer.
What would you like to eat?
Good evening.
He only eats fruit.
I need new soles on these shoes.
Everybody liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Attention please!
He runs.
Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow.
My right shoulder hurts.
My father was busy.
Everybody's ready to go.
I missed the 7:00 train.
He had one daughter.
She's my wife.
Let's chat.
Do you have a pen on you?
Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
What time do you usually eat lunch?
What does that word mean?
How much will I receive?
Do you speak English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is taller than I am.
Tom's parents were also singers.
Here is your bag.
Tom's alive.
He looks pale.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom got angry.
What is its cost?
You can eat all you want.
Leave it.
I have a slight fever.
Can you speak French?
He is a doctor.
Fill it up.
What is your age?
Get Tom.
They yelled.
You're screaming.
I do not think there will be rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like astrology.
She was raised in France.
He did not work on Sunday night.
He taught me how to write.
Happy birthday!
This is not your book, it's mine.
Thirteen people were killed.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
Tom's father is a musician.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's one o'clock.
I'm never wrong.
Where is the boarding gate for UA 111?
I'm lazy.
Why are you screaming?!
Tom wants his umbrella back.
When do you usually go to bed?
The two countries negotiated a treaty.
I only speak French with Tom.
Tom winked.
Can you gift-wrap this, please?
Tom is now in prison.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
She smiled.
She hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
She's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'd be grateful.
The terrorists released the hostages.
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time.
I have lost my wallet.
She's a good person.
We've done that.
The government lightened taxes.
Leave town.
Count to thirty.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
He can speak Japanese.
Did you see him go out?
What time does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't want anymore.
I'm thirsty.
We traveled on foot.
I want it.
I need those documents.
Tom yelled.
Tom hardly ever laughs.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom is crying.
How much does it cost?
I am well.
They are doctors.
The plane arrived exactly at nine.
I don't know what you mean.
The audience was mostly businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom is probably sleeping.
I'm quite hungry.
Tom has won many races.
He knows where we live.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom washed the potatoes.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll be outside.
My mother cooks well.
They screamed.
The experiment was successful.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will be allowed to keep the gold that he found.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17, too.
Here's your key.
Leave Tom.
Drink up your milk.
We're both named Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the vase?
Tom has been injured.
Follow Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom has been wounded.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We made too many mistakes.
Why are you yelling?
What is your father's name?
Look there.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the pharmacy.
Happy Canada Day!
I'm going to be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom nodded his head.
Are we prepared?
I like Tom's blue pineapple.
He was very patient.
What's your age?
Listen carefully.
Would you like to come shopping with me?
Go slow.
They live there.
I'll scream.
Everyone is tired.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm shy.
Tom seemed genuinely surprised when I told him that Mary had left town.
I heard screaming.
What time is your plane?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I found the book interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I got up at 8 o'clock today.
Turn on the light, please.
Tom is hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Are those yours?
Who is she?
This is the shortest way to the station.
Tom tried to hit Mary.
How did you come to know her?
That's not possible.
What time does the train arrive at Yokohama?
What time is it?
Don't change sentences that are correct. You can, instead, submit natural-sounding alternative translations.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anybody left me any message?
I want to cook for you.
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
We failed.
This room has air conditioning.
Did you read it all?
Tom visited Boston.
Speak clearly.
Don't open that.
Tom saw her.
It may snow in the evening.
I'm not proud of that.
Is anybody there?
Mistakes happen.
I'm not young anymore.
She is eating.
It's only blood.
Would you like to come fishing with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Just a minute.
Tom was wounded.
Mary explained it.
I'm not denying it.
Don't look.
Finish this as soon as possible.
Use this.
What time does this train reach Yokohama?
I don't get it either.
I got up at seven this morning.
I'm in the house.
Slow down.
Merry Christmas!
I went inside.
Me, too.
I'm not very busy.
It's quite nice.
Do it again!
Tom started coughing.
They're children.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
I know this.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet hurt.
Ask Tom.
I wonder what I should get you for your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you yelling?
Stay right there.
Eat whatever food you like.
We used to play in the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy a ticket?
I have finished my work.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally found my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you all right?
I've never seen Tom happier.
Don't enter.
We're lost.
Tom is screaming.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I am sick.
I'm just looking, thank you.
It is unfortunately true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do I look?
Tom is not happy to be here.
She got mad.
I don't like to drink coffee.
Speak more slowly.
May I have your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here's your mug.
We don't care what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We'll never be able to play any better.
We're shy.
The bill could be paid today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You may go there.
We both know this isn't right.
Eat whatever you like.
I've got wine.
Why was Tom crying?
