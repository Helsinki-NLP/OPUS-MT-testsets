That's what I don't understand. 
I bought this camera yesterday. 
Tom'll pay. 
Not bad. 
You can stay with us for the night. 
All of a sudden the sky became dark. 
Do you think I don't care? 
This is really delicious. 
The picture is in this book. 
My mum has three dogs. 
This damned computer won't work. 
I've learned to live with the pain in my back. 
I have already done it. 
A cat was sitting on the chair. 
Why are you giving up so easily? 
Her daughter fried the meat. 
I'm used to staying up late. 
Tom is a communist. 
I like your cat, but she doesn't like me. 
What kind of places would you like to see? 
He is liked by everybody. 
It was a very beautiful flower. 
He believes whatever I say. 
He denied that he was the thief. 
I'm sure he will come. 
I don't agree with you. 
We used to be best friends. 
She looked pleased with her new job. 
Never have I been so happy. 
How long did you live there? 
Tom needed money. 
I have to find her. 
Tom was my first boyfriend. 
Two years ago I could not play basketball at all. 
I'll do it later on. 
Only you answered the question. 
Those ladies and gentlemen who live in the suburbs of Yokohama, if it is convenient to you, please come. 
I was in the bath. 
We've already mentioned Tom. 
Who is the man sitting at the other end of the table? 
If you need me, I'll be in my room. 
My father is very infirm. 
Tom is the best player on the team. 
Start writing. 
You don't know what he told me. 
My mother left me a message. 
The birds were hungry. 
Can't you read? 
What kind of help do you need? 
I want to live in Brazil. 
Oh my God! What are you doing? 
We eat fish raw. 
Tom isn't unemployed. 
Don't make me laugh. 
Do you want to hear what that person said about you? 
Teresa is a Portuguese name. 
When will your mum return from the hospital? 
She is not my sister, she's my wife. 
Please sit down. 
He is opening the window. 
I am happy. 
Why did you stop then? 
The situation is critical. 
Where do you see the books? 
I'm useless. 
In basketball, tall players have an advantage. 
I live in Athens. 
Everything you've heard is true. 
Excuse me, what time is it? 
Tom has to go home now. 
My mother is dead too. 
To my surprise, she could not answer the question. 
Is she here yet? 
You shouldn't read other people's private letters without permission. 
I'm dead against the plan. 
I can cross the river by swimming. 
I ordered new furniture. 
Painting was the great love of his life. 
Pollution causes damage to the economy. 
He has agreed with me. 
The eyes are windows to the soul. 
You are as white as a sheet. 
I took the book. 
The river flows into the sea. 
Please shut the door. 
It was just a joke! 
I'm very busy. 
Translate this book into English. 
You cannot kill yourself by holding your breath. 
You are as white as a sheet. 
The doctor examined the child and said she was healthy. 
You don't eat anything. 
Don't run around the pool. 
Be creative. 
Scientists interpret it differently. 
Do I curse too much? 
Turn off the light, please. 
She's not a hero. 
What did you do that for? 
Do you think that we'll find her house? 
Which team is ours? 
She played the guitar and he sang. 
You're weird - I like you. 
Keep away from the fire. 
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow. 
The walls of my room are green. 
The calculator is a wonderful invention. 
Did he really do that? 
I saw her enter the room. 
There are a lot of books in his room. 
When did you find this? 
The one who has everything can lose everything. 
Are you hungry? 
You never get my jokes. 
I found a pair of gloves under the chair. 
He returns tomorrow. 
I need a stamp. 
I can't just leave you here. 
Life's too short to drink cheap wine. 
If the machine is damaged, you are responsible. 
This is my cow. 
They are much taller than us. 
She had, I thought, no reason to do what she did. 
Weren't you tired? 
Good evening, how are you? 
She's very pretty. 
I said that to myself. 
People ought to work. 
"Shut up," he whispered. 
As he often tells lies, he is not to be relied on. 
What do you want to say? 
Leave me alone! 
I do it without any problems. 
Mark took his stuff and left. 
Finally we have learned the truth. 
You look stupid. 
Tom currently teaches English in Japan. 
Tom complained about the noise. 
Nobody came. 
Whose bicycle did you want to borrow? 
Have you told anyone where our hideout is? 
I came to Japan for the first time. 
Look at what Mary is doing. 
He knows how to play poker. 
Thank you very much! 
It is finally all over. 
I don't like school. 
The bird was looking for worms. 
I'm proud of my son. 
Mary burst into the kitchen. 
I don't have the slightest idea. 
Don't be in such a hurry. 
Why are you so angry? 
There are many words that I don't understand. 
May I have a cup of tea? 
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow. 
My dream is to study Tatar in Kazan. 
I am a university student. 
I'd like to buy a map. 
You'll have to drive. 
Bring your brother with you. 
Betty always managed to get what she wanted. 
You didn't tell him anything? 
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen. 
She knows exactly what she wants. 
Hello! 
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week? 
Good morning. It's time to wake up. 
The baby cried all night. 
She didn't like city life. 
This size is too large for me. 
That won't change anything. 
Do as you want. 
The man you saw yesterday is my uncle. 
I don't like winter. 
I gave Tom a chance. 
We played golf in spite of the rain. 
What kind of test is that? 
He told me his life's story. 
I decided to be happy because it's good for my health. 
I'll wait here until he comes back. 
The teacher teaches. 
What do you see in him? 
What do you see? 
It's not what you think! 
You can buy yourself a dog in that store. 
He likes sweet tea. 
You must do it yourself. 
It's simple and intuitive. 
How many hours a week do you work? 
Yes, two. 
They don't help. 
Please get in touch with me as soon as you arrive in Boston. 
She asked me who had arrived first. 
Sooner or later, we all are going to die. 
How long will it take? 
It's a shadow. 
Where is the German embassy? 
Be friendly. 
This rose is beautiful. 
But he knew it couldn't last. 
Probably not. 
I also want it! 
She's looking but she doesn't see anything. 
Today, he is not allowed to eat anything sweet. 
She is eating. 
I'd like to travel around the world. 
Do you like Italian? 
I got five years in prison. 
I'm a loser. 
Any universe simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind able to understand it. 
We didn't need to hurry. 
Pardon me? 
It doesn't matter which team wins the game. 
He runs. 
This dress is too big for me. 
Go and stand next to your car. 
Bring her a plate of salad. 
We are at war. 
She has not replied. 
I heard that Mary wants a divorce. 
Is this a stallion or a mare? 
Father is coming home tomorrow. 
This mountain is snow-covered the entire year. 
Never lose hope. 
Can you pass me the salt? 
This book belongs to the library. 
I want to die with Getter Jaani. 
We make milk into cheese and butter. 
Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning. 
You guys get the best shots. 
How can you say that? 
Pay attention! 
It is plain that you have done this before. 
Did you receive the letter? 
Two years ago I could not play basketball at all. 
What's the difference? 
You're to blame. 
She turned down my request. 
Which one do you prefer? 
I like Korean cuisine. 
I was invited to dinner. 
You're still green. 
There is nothing here. 
You never can tell what'll happen in the future. 
We made some squirrel-shaped cookies. 
Everyone loves puppets. 
What did I do to deserve this? 
See the example given above. 
Her hat looked very funny. 
I wanted to become a philosopher. 
You're not fast enough. 
We left the door open. 
Can you come at nine? 
Why did you call? 
They discussed the problem. 
If I hadn't had his help, I would be dead. 
He was almost asleep. 
I have one brother. 
What have you come here for? 
Do you like this color? 
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here by now? 
A million people lost their live during the war. 
Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard. 
She greeted him cheerfully. 
They need our help. 
Did you get Tom's message? 
I don't like the way he talks. 
I don't even know what's happening to me anymore. 
I learned a lot from him. 
He killed that man. 
Don't expect too much. 
The brown hat is old. 
He plays golf every Sunday. 
Be creative. 
I couldn't understand what he was saying. 
Lock the gate. 
I'm always tired. 
He's a weird guy. 
Go back to your seat. 
Be friendly. 
Isn't it a lovely morning? 
That's quite a story. 
I'm getting more and more gray hair. 
He turned off the light. 
I'm an insomniac. 
The sky is blue. 
The old woman fell and could not get up. 
After the movie they fall asleep. 
You can use my dictionary. 
I want to talk with your uncle. 
Tom likes you. 
He rarely stays home on Sunday. 
When would you like to see him? 
Tom started yelling for help. 
His son is eight years old. 
If I had wings, I would fly to you. 
Where the hell are you going? 
He promised me that he would be more careful in the future. 
At what time did you hear the gunshot? 
I forgot to buy one pillow. 
I've heard quite a lot about you. 
Don't go out now. We're about to have lunch. 
Italy is a very beautiful country. 
It's a snowman. 
Eat the bread! 
Even though he lives in the United States, Tom can't speak English. 
The school is five kilometers from my home. 
I gave my weapons away. 
Who ate all of our food? 
I know that her bread will be tasty. 
Please come. 
Women change the world. 
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground. 
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom. 
You may sit down on the chair. 
We need more sugar. 
The smell of roses filled the room. 
Evil sometimes wins. 
Tom has already drunk three cups of coffee. 
I don't understand German. 
Yes, please. 
I'll assist you. 
You are to blame. 
What are you looking for there? 
What does it mean? 
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest. 
Who's there? 
I am learning Japanese. 
It's pointless. 
It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent. 
Tell me how you solved the problem. 
Would you like to dance with me? 
Even if I wanted to, I could never explain what happened in there. 
I'm afraid of heights. 
I don't know where to go. 
Let's go if it's not raining. 
Who's coming with me? 
I agree. 
Compare the facts. 
I'm not hungry right now. 
I will go to France on holiday. 
You may sit wherever you like. 
You're an engineer. 
The door opened slowly. 
That's quite a story. 
Do you play any sports? 
It is high time you started a new business. 
Let's wait here. 
The girl I told you about lives here. 
Please just leave. 
I can't believe that she is older than my mother. 
Look back and you'll see a black cat. 
His family moved around quite a lot. 
Do you know him? 
I don't know whether to turn left or right. 
I'll clean up the kitchen later. 
He came from a tiny mountain town. 
I talked to friends. 
All of your cats are grey. 
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together. 
When we go to bed, we say "good night". 
The scandal ruined his career. 
Cats are complex individuals. 
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread. 
I suggest you ask Tom. 
This bag is not small. 
There is nothing wrong with this. 
If you invite him, he'll probably come. 
I know that you know that I know. 
Come home before six. 
The bread is fresh. 
I'll be back in half an hour. 
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore. 
Are you a lawyer? 
Where is your school? 
The candles made the room bright. 
Excuse me. 
Fold the paper in the middle. 
What does he say in his letter? 
The woman is eating bread. 
I'm eating an apple. 
The lonely man derives pleasure from observing ants. 
Who's the man sitting at the other end of the table? 
Are you pregnant? 
Now I'm really tired. 
His pace quickened. 
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me. 
Why do you need a new umbrella? 
He drew a straight line on the wall. 
Do you need a car? 
Take off your hat when you enter a classroom. 
They do nothing but complain. 
She was in a hurry. 
Please get in touch with me as soon as you arrive in Boston. 
Tom got up at 7:00. 
This one is for us. 
I'm listening to the radio. 
The boy wants to know the truth. 
Tom ate the whole pizza by himself. 
You've got to take care of yourself. 
You need patience, Tom. 
How are you? 
Your journey starts here. 
Can you believe what he said? 
Tom asked where you were. 
I'd love to help you out, but I'm terribly busy. 
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary. 
I think we should call Tom. 
Don't miss the bus. 
All the apples are there. 
You'll have to pay. 
At what time should we go to the station? 
The more I think about it, the less I like it. 
I'll drive you to the new store. 
Everybody knows her. 
She is unbelievably naïve. 
Where in Turkey do you live? 
Tom has disappeared. 
I can't. 
Get out of the classroom. 
There are three dogs sleeping on mum's carpet. 
Tom has already finished the work that he needed to do. 
If you can't have children, you could always adopt. 
That's exactly what I thought. 
Running as fast as she could, she still failed to catch the bus. 
They need friends. 
Beef, please. 
Could you gift wrap it? 
Do you enjoy living like this? 
It's very hot today, isn't it? 
Do you really have no home? 
Do you play chess? 
Her boyfriend is Turkish. 
Answer me. 
My mother can't come. 
There are a lot of breweries in Bavaria. 
Do you know if he has a girlfriend? 
I have no family. 
The parents expected too much of their son. 
What do you wish to order, gentlemen? 
He made it. 
He entered my room without permission. 
You can't just leave. 
Come on, get a move on! 
You may sit down on the chair. 
Where do you live if you have no home? 
Our union can be perfected. 
He told me that I could use his car. 
Almost all the students like English. 
It was such a hard test that we did not have time to finish. 
That is all. 
You need to work fast. 
If you believe society hasn't made anything worthwhile, then you might believe also in mass destruction. 
English is spoken around the world. 
All their efforts were in vain. 
Where's a mirror? 
This girl sings pretty well. 
Life is unfair. 
Each person paid a thousand dollars. 
Jill is the only girl in our club. 
The students don't have to go to school today. 
The sun disappeared behind a cloud. 
His parents were pleased with his success. 
This is now our home. 
I’ll call them tomorrow when I return home. 
He helped me fix my watch. 
Nobody forced you to help me. 
John doesn't know what to do next. 
He was suffering from a bad headache.

I asked her to dance. 
Have you already done your homework? 
John is professor of French literature at Oxford and his wife is French. 
Did you understand what he said? 
What's the colour of her hair? 
The sooner you return, the happier your father will be. 
Are you ready to start your journey? 
Your watch is ten minutes slow. 
They've fooled you. 
I thought you said it was yours. 
How much money do you have hidden under your bed? 
We believe in God. 
I'm Irish. 
This is the man I've been waiting for. 
He did not pay the debt and disappeared. 
Mr Brown speaks Japanese very well. 
No, he's not my new boyfriend. 
Love watching baseball and football. 
Everybody but Tom smiled. 
The queen stood beside the king. 
This bridge was built two years ago. 
He's my first love. 
You must keep your promise. 
Tom seems different today. 
How much is the rent for this room? 
We have to get the hell out of here. 
Tom doesn't want to ever do that again. 
I asked her to wait a minute. 
How long ago did you start learning Esperanto? 
They're not a threat. 
Her advice influenced me to go abroad. 
You are the only one who can help me. 
What places does that tour visit? 
It started raining hard. Because of that, we played inside. 
Your carpet is completely white. 
But I don't want to. 
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight. 
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer. 
I resemble my mother. 
You look very lovely tonight. 
Doctor, can you hear me out? 
You understand, don't you? 
I expect that I will see him on Monday. 
Tom changed clothes. 
The oven's hot so be careful not to burn yourself. 
Did you find your letters? 
For the love of God! 
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not. 
The shop sells expensive accessories for women. 
I don't like to make a mistake. 
This is not theirs. 
I'm not used to getting up early. 
Stay where you are. 
The house is hers. 
The doctor advised him to stop working too much. 
Are you certain? 
You were busy. 
I can't live like this anymore. 
He will do anything to make money. 
I just want to talk. 
What kind of music does Tom like? 
That tree grows next to her house. 
Don't talk in the reading room. 
How are you doing, miss? 
I exchanged yen for dollars. 
I hate winter. 
I think Tom is going to try to kill Mary. 
There are only two correct answers. 
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money. 
When and where did you come to know her? 
Where did you curse them? 
Tom didn't appear. 
Don't be so serious. It's only a game. 
He told a funny story. 
I don't have time right now. 
Tom is the captain of our team. 
This carpet is very long. 
Listen to what the teacher says. 
Why does nobody eat my potatoes? 
I asked Tom to play the guitar. 
What does it remind you of? 
She translated it word for word. 
What a wonderful night! 
I can't find Tim. 
She named him Charles. 
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl. 
Life is beautiful. 
She's driving them to school. 
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable. 
No one believed what you said. 
I didn't know what to say. 
Do you think I should go alone? 
Just answer the question. 
I never want to owe money to anyone. 
Look at the train going over the bridge. 
I'm not the only one who likes Tom. 
I'm really bored right now. 
No, I don't think that I am to blame. 
Where are we? 
I am forty-five years old. 
Her hat looked funny. 
Don't scold her. She's too young to understand. 
I bought this suit just for this occasion. 
It's similar. 
Be careful, OK? 
It's the only explanation. 
I can't believe I'm actually here. 
Do you know the way? 
I like it very much. 
Tom will need help. 
I have printed 100 pages. 
I see and hear. 
Don't forget the ticket. 
Raise your hand before you answer. 
Change the flag, please. 
Isn't it true that you own a gun? 
I was in bed all day long yesterday. 
The war brought their research to an end. 
When spring comes, the days get longer day by day. 
I'm listening to the radio. 
Sweet dreams! 
Leave my car alone. 
This is Tony's book. 
I should have come earlier. 
Tom eats only what he wants to eat. 
Who stole the apple? 
He lost his ticket for the movie. 
What would you do in his position? 
I don't like summer. 
By the way, what is your address? 
She was lying face down on the bed. 
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants. 
That's what I've always said. 
He heard him cry at midnight. 
Please bring me a glass of water. 
He grabbed her hand. 
Eat the bread! 
If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. 
This time you should do it by yourself. 
I received the hospitality of the family. 
You don't understand. 
She has green eyes and light brown hair. 
Does Tom have experience? 
She left her umbrella in the train. 
I am a vegetarian. 
It is necessary for you to go there. 
What's the reason? 
I can't see anything from here. 
Since I didn't receive a reply, I wrote to her again. 
He's standing behind the wall. 
Don't expect too much of me. 
They missed a good chance. 
Fight for your right. 
He always speaks to me when he meets me on the street. 
Look at the book on the desk. 
I had one beer and pretended to be very drunk. 
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard. 
Somebody opened the door. 
Do you have any questions in this lesson? 
We saw her enter the park. 
It doesn't look like you're busy. 
You didn't seem to want that book. 
I have a red bicycle. 
He's short and fat. 
I want to go to Tokyo. 
The trip was exhausting. 
He is much smarter than I am. 
Tom still doesn't look too interested. 
It is terrible weather today. 
I didn't want this to happen. 
The dog is trying to escape. 
As l was saying, I won't do anything. 
There is a small brown dog under that table. 
Stop them. 
Ann likes chocolate very much. 
I know that Mike likes basketball. 
I have to peel a whole bucket of apples for a jam. 
He died of old age two years ago. 
Take the chair to your room. 
The taxi abruptly turned left. 
Yes, I understand. Thank you. 
I'll join in ten minutes.

She worked hard. 
Don't be afraid of change. 
Please open this box. 
Is eating fish good for you? 
My baby wants to talk. 
I asked her what kind of music she liked. 
There are no witnesses of the accident. 
Is she satisfied? 
But he knew he had no choice. 
Do you remember this game? 
She disappeared with no documents. 
I'm often here. 
She continued her talk. 
Mike can't play baseball well. 
Camels are often used to travel in the desert. 
Mary is a bookworm. 
Have a nice weekend. 
I saw a car through the window. 
Are you ready? 
I'm happy because I am not a woman. 
Stop wasting time and get back to work. 
The more, the better. 
Ten years is a long time. 
Is this your car? 
I can't believe you're still hungry. 
It is only normal to want to be happy. 
We've got to move very carefully. 
Did you get Tom's message? 
I had an ache in my arm yesterday. 
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money. 
I don't have a computer at home. 
My father does not eat much fruit. 
Can you give me a discount? 
She kissed me on the cheek and said goodnight. 
My friend is here. 
Where are you living now? 
The older you are, the more difficult it is to learn a language. 
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes. 
Not all people like dogs. 
I'm going to stay there for a couple of days. 
I feel unwell. 
Why did you say such a stupid thing? 
You can't defeat me. 
I don't think I could do that. 
Is this the real truth? 
She is crying. 
See you in hell. 
He is my father. 
He doesn't want to wait for you. 
Tom took his family to the zoo. 
Tom refused to go to the hospital. 
It's exactly half-past eight. 
This car was made in Japan. 
Is this your first time in Japan? 
Tony was happy. 
My father asked me to open the door. 
Make his identikit! 
Your brother wasn't at school today. 
Tom will never let you down. 
I was in Canada then. 
I made this food myself. 
Write it in pencil. 
Somebody wrote my name on the wall. 
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong. 
They don't have any sugar any more. 
I love your daughter. 
Tom hopes he won't be eating leftovers again tonight. 
Someone opened the door. 
I'm not your mother. 
Why isn't Tom in the car? 
My name's Ricardo. 
When did you receive the telegram? 
You shouldn't swim in that pond. 
When will the snow melt? 
He thought that I was very tired. 
I think that she doesn't want to eat any more. 
You are either with us, or against us. 
Please help me. I'm dying. 
Tom knows that Mary likes him. 
I like this music. 
She was afraid of the dog. 
He was walking to the store, but stopped next to her house. 
The snow is falling fast. 
We're having lunch here. 
Of course I should read this book. 
Tom isn't currently in prison. 
Tom went with Mary to the museum. 
The ship disappeared beyond the horizon. 
Good morning, my sweet dog. 
God blesses those who repent. 
I can't work with you standing there. 
Marilla had problems with her lungs. 
We were one big happy family. 
What colour is the car which she bought for herself? 
The baby cried all night. 
Do you see me? 
She testified against him. 
My father grows rice. 
We speak Japanese. 
The result was disappointing. 
I came in through the window. 
The meat's not ready yet. 
Give me a piece of chalk. 
She needs to sleep more. 
Did you hear something? 
Is she your mother? 
It's become dark. Would you turn on the light? 
He doesn't trust the doctor any more. 
It was the first time that I visited the museum. 
We had a wonderful time. 
I think Tom is going to want to sit down. 
What a wonderful family. 
Are you still in Florida? 
You shouldn't have eaten the fish raw. 
Get ready! Tomorrow is the last day. 
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything. 
When was the last time you saw Tom? 
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. 
They talked about love. 
Tom doesn't want to ever do that again. 
I don't understand. 
Left to himself, the child would feel very lonely. 
I know no one here. 
The team lacked mobility. 
The cat crossed the street. 
There's a mirror. 
Why don't you want to help the police? 
I'd like to see your father. 
Please continue. 
He was busy. 
I am a widow. 
I saw him. 
I study Lojban. 
"Good morning", said Tom with a smile. 
My arm hurts. 
He needs a ladder. 
You shouldn't go. 
You should not trust him. 
In one week there are seven days. 
You have to choose your own path in life. 
Without air and water, nothing could live. 
He slipped and nearly fell. 
They work eight hours a day. 
I eat and drink. 
I do it every Sunday morning. 
She quickly opened the letter. 
Are you busy at the moment? 
I'll take back all I said. 
Where did you get all those keys? 
I came in through the window. 
Take Tom to the hospital. 
I have a white cat. 
He hastily wrote down our names. 
Our son died during the war. 
He is unsatisfied with the result. 
It's clear that you're wrong. 
I can't tell who will arrive first. 
I don't want to talk to you, because you broke my heart. 
Don't trust him. 
We may as well all go. 
Who's the person sitting at the other end of the table? 
The idea is very attractive. 
They are going shopping. 
Everything genius is simple. 
Her students study too much. 
Tom raised his hand. 
Put on your shoes. Let's go out for dinner. 
The birds flew to the south. 
The tea is very tasty. 
I don't agree with him. 
I am to blame. 
Not bad, but I'm a bit tired. 
This is a great idea. 
He is very proud of his toy. 
This will do us for the present. 
I'm not afraid at all. 
The woman wants to know the truth. 
Is this word in common use? 
Lithuania is joining the European Union. 
I want to be a linguist. 
Where is the cat? 
I'm sorry for what I've done. 
She became a postman. 
I learned how to ride a bike when I was six years old. 
He took out a piece of chalk. 
Let me do this. 
I like jazz music. 
I am convinced that he is innocent. 
Open the window and let in some fresh air. 
Have you ever sewed on a button? 
It snows hard. 
Did you see my mother? 
I know what his name is. 
Tom doesn't want to live like that. 
Do you approve of what she is doing? 
He came here before school was over. 
Do you know their address? 
What the hell are you doing? 
Tony looked down at his dirty old shoes. 
Her cat was lying on my pillow and didn't want to come off it. 
There are a few good hotels in town. 
Who is this letter from? 
He doesn't want to study today. 
We're all different. 
You don't know how much I love you. 
I wrote a long letter to her. 
He was not able to do what he wanted. 
I feel a little weak today. 
Life is interesting. 
Has she come? 
I do not like to make mistakes. 
Be careful, OK? 
I bought a camera for 30 dollars. 
It's great out here. 
This is not a method, this is provocation. 
Answer in English. 
He wants to see us again. 
The water here is very shallow. 
Where do you live? 
My friend doesn't use sugar. 
I fell off the ladder. 
He knows how to interrogate people. 
Bob was washing the dishes at that time. 
My brother is two years older than I, but he is three centimeters shorter. 
I can only tell you what I know. 
I'm thinking about you. 
What's your home address? 
He will be free tomorrow. 
Have you seen my wife? 
Your daughter overheard us talking. 
Tom will die soon. 
I'm used to staying up late. 
I have met him before. 
Look at the house with the red roof. 
My apartment is on the fourth floor. 
She was already pregnant. 
We are basketball players. 
These clothes suit you. 
Don't blame it on her. 
Did you know you are stronger than you think you are? 
I love her so much that I can't leave her. 
Can you go with us? 
I don't care for him. 
Tom could think of no reason why he needed to go home early. 
Raise your hand. 
He did not sell the house. 
No one has ever seen God. 
She saw somebody waiting for her next to the school. 
It doesn't look like you're busy. 
Where is Mary? 
The new contract enables us to demand whatever we want. 
Tom is still a prisoner. 
Go and open the door. 
I said I would ring again later. 
My God, help me! 
She told him that she was happy. 
She needs him more than he needs her. 
Enjoy your holidays. 
Tom, I'm back. 
Did you want to see me? 
This is not an error. 
The airport is quite far from the city centre. 
You can turn the radio off now. 
You can turn off the radio now. 
You're a really sweet person. 
Ankara is in Turkey. 
You're a really sweet person. 
I have been to Boston several times. 
You're a really sweet person.
