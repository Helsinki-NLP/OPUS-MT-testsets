Thousands in Central Park panic after barrier collapse
The collapse of a police barrier sent thousands of people fleeing in a panic in Central Park, afraid of possible gunshots at a politically-charged show.
Big-name personalities from Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake to Janet Jackson and John Legend urged spectators to get involved in the nation's troubled politics.
Authorities quickly assured the crowd they were safe after the barrier fell Saturday evening.
Burning social justice issues dominated the event that started on a sunny afternoon.
About 60,000 people filled the park's Great Lawn for the Global Citizen Festival, also awaiting Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars.
Some speakers asked the audience to call their Congress members to react to this week's Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Alastair Seeley continues British Supersport winning run at Assen
Alastair Seeley has continued his winning form in British Supersports
Alastair Seeley took his third win in five British Supersport races by taking victory in Saturday's 12-lap sprint race at Assen in the Netherlands.
The Carrickfergus rider took the chequered flag by 0.05 seconds from fellow Yamaha rider Jack Kennedy.
The 38-year-old also won races at Silverstone and Oulton Park this month.
Seeley is competing for the Northern Ireland-based EHA Racing outfit for whom he won a race at the North West 200 international road races in May.
The former British champion and Kennedy were involved in a race-long scrap and despite the Dubliner's last-ditch attempts he was unable to squeeze past the Northern Irishman.
Seeley's team-mate David Allingham was seventh in Saturday's Supersport race.
Scott Swann was eighth in the British Talent Cup race.
Glenn Irwin was fourth quickest in qualifying for Sunday's two British Superbike races on his Be Wiser Ducati as he aims to improve on his current fourth place in the championship standings.
It was revealed earlier this week that Irwin would switch to the JG Speedfit Kawasaki team for the 2019 season.
Toomebridge pilot Michael Laverty was 13th on his Tyco BMW and Andrew Irwin 14th on the second of the PBM Ducatis.

Doughnut seller Lina Ognissanti to be honoured by Bedford mayor
Image caption Lina Ognissanti sells ice creams in warmer months and doughnuts during the winter
A woman who has sold doughnuts and ice creams in a town centre for more than 40 years is to be honoured with a private mayoral reception.
Lina Ognissanti, who runs Dinky Donuts and an ice cream stall on Midland Road, Bedford, has been invited to afternoon tea, along with her family.
Almost 3,000 people signed an online petition to get her an award or recognition.
Mrs Ognissanti said it was an "honour" to be thought of so highly.
The Mayor of Bedford, Dave Hodgson, said Mrs Ognissanti, along with her children and grandchildren, had been invited to his parlour to view the civic regalia and historical artefacts and to have afternoon tea.
"Lina has a special status in Bedford, and her stand is an institution in the town centre," he said.
"I'm delighted that Lina has accepted my invitation and I look forward to welcoming her to the parlour in order that we can show our appreciation for her contribution to the town."
Mrs Ognissanti thanked the "lovely" people of Bedford for thinking of her, and said: "It is a great honour, and really nice."
Sarkab Mahmood, who started the petition, said he had not expected such a huge response.
On hearing about the reception, which is set to take place by the end of the year, he said: "I am really happy for her, it is all down to Lina being such a great person."
Rolling with the Ulster Lambretta Club
Lambrettas were an essential accessory in the mod scene of the 1960s.
The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts of the Italian motor scooter.
Around 100 scooters from all over the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh this weekend, 70 years after the first Ulster Lambretta Club was formed.
Chris Wilson, one of two members of the original club, bought his first Lambretta for around £40 in 1966.
"A scooter was just to me a form of transport, but then there was the option to use it for other things.
It was a bit of sport.
I never did get into the mod scene and I'm probably far too old now for it," he said.
"Basically it was relatively cheap, relatively reliable and they were available for the right amount of money and once you had one there were other things you could do with it other than just riding from A to B."
He used to race Lambrettas in time trials around the TT circuit on the Isle of Man.
The first Ulster Lambretta Club wound up in the early 1970s but it was reformed 12 years ago.
"It started to die out around 1971, the interest in scooters, other forms of transport and the Troubles didn't help with clubs in general, so I thought, 'No that's it, finished'," Chris said.
"And then sometime back there were showings of the interest in it and it seems to have grown and grown."
Philip Steele is the membership secretary of the Ulster Lambretta Club which currently has 97 members.
"Everyone's got their own take.
Obviously there'll be guys influenced from the whole mod scene, that's where a lot of it started.
Other guys are into the racing scene, rockers, there's a mixture of everyone in it here.
Some people are just into the vintage thing.
Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same.
You can either keep them original and potter along at 35 or 40 mph they were originally designed to go around the small streets in Italy, but some of the guys have tuned these things.
Some of these bikes here probably could do upwards of 100 mph, the super tuned ones. "
There were a few breakdowns and push starts over the weekend.
And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as the Lambretta's Italian home, the sun was shining as the scooters toured around County Fermanagh.
Ruth Davidson calls for Tory Brexit 'silence'
Ruth Davidson has called for a "period of silence" among her Conservative colleagues to allow the prime minister to get a Brexit deal "over the line."
The Scottish Tory leader said the two years following the EU referendum had provided enough time for debate.
Her comments follow Boris Johnson's description of the Chequers plan as "deranged and entirely preposterous."
She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland it was now time to get behind the prime minister.
As Tory activists assembled in Birmingham for their party conference, she said: "There's been time over the last two years for debate.
The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year.
Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country.
In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one."
Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.
Theresa May later insisted she did believe in Brexit, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union.
Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 "the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event."
Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: "In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want.
I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for."
M8 fully reopens after police incident
The M8 motorway in Glasgow has been fully reopened after being shut by a police incident.
Police said the route was closed in both directions at junction 15 Townhead shortly before 07:00 amid concern for the wellbeing of a pedestrian.
The closure resulted in the route being at a standstill for three hours and traffic disruption in the city, which is hosting the Great Scottish Run.
A 20-year-old man was later taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for checks.
Christine Blasey Ford's friend clarifies statement about alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh
Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while they were both teenagers, has written a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee to clarify that although she does not remember the house party where the misconduct allegedly occurred, she believes Ford's account.
Keyser had previously released a statement through her attorney saying that she did not remember the party in question, and that she does not remember ever meeting Kavanaugh.
In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee Thursday, Kavanaugh often brought up Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, although he omitted that Keyser said that she believed Ford.
President Trump instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation within one week on Friday, after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and other moderate senators called for a weeklong delay on a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation to give time for an investigation.
On Saturday, Keyser said through her lawyer in a letter to the committee that she was willing to "cooperate fully with the FBI's supplemental investigation" into Kavanaugh.
"However, as my client has already made clear, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford," the letter from Howard Walsh, Keyser's attorney, said.
It continued that Keyser "does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account."
"However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question," the letter continued.
Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh's who was allegedly present during the assault, has also said that he will cooperate with the FBI investigation.
Wrongfully convicted Chicago residents recall life under corrupt cop and his "gang"
The top prosecutor in Illinois is trying to turn the page from a dark period in Chicago police history.
It's believed that one bad cop preyed on innocent residents of a housing project, rounding up dozens of people on bogus charges.
So far, 42 wrongly convicted people have been exonerated.
An empty lot is now all that's left of the Ida B. Wells housing project where a group of corrupt Chicago cops preyed almost risk-free on residents for most of a decade.
Sergeant Ronald Watts was their ringleader.
Residents have accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, filing false police reports, planting evidence and assault.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those exonerated so far by Cook County state attorney Kim Foxx.
"If you didn't cooperate with him, you was going down.
You was against him.
You was against his operation and his way of getting money," Cleon Glover said of Watts.
"I was terrified.
I was trying to get away, get out of that neighborhood.
I had nowhere to go," Willie Martin said.
Lawyers from Foxx's conviction integrity unit are reviewing 30 to 40 additional cases connected to Watts.
Ida B. Wells housing resident Landon Allen said a lot of people spoke up about Watts.
"Everybody spoke up," he said.
"But it didn't matter."
As Clarissa Baker, another former resident, pointed out, it was their word against a sergeant with a badge.
"He has his own gang.
So who would believe us?"
Baker said.
Joshua Tepfer of the University of Chicago's exoneration project says the answer until recently was no one.
"They let it go on because they viewed these people as disposable and they didn't care because they're black people in the housing projects who in their minds were guilty of something anyway," Tepfer said.
"Sgt. Watts went to prison in 2013 and served 22 months for trying to steal from an FBI informant.
Martez Wise went to prison too - because of Watts.
During that time I had just had my son.
I was away from him for four years.
He barely even know who I was because he was just born, so I had to re-bond with him," Wise said.
"Four years taken away for nothing."
72-year-old Fidelity bets on the future with blockchain, virtual reality and AI
Fidelity recognized the potential in blockchain before it became the corporate buzzword of 2018.
CEO Abby Johnson led the charge into cryptocurrency, one of the riskiest and most volatile asset classes of the past year.
"A few plus years ago, myself and a few other senior executives here were just curious about what was going on, particularly with bitcoin," Johnson said.
We started getting together to say 'we're got to understand this.'
The curiosity led them to start bitcoin "mining," at a location in New Hampshire when the crypto's price was around $180.
Flash forward to December of last year when bitcoin rose to almost $20,000, "behold - the price goes up and all the sudden we're making money, which was never the intent," Johnson said.
She did not specify how much bitcoin has been mined, or how much money Fidelity made.
There's clear interest in the topic by Fidelity employees.
Its blockchain club for employees called "bits and blocks," hosts seminars, office hours and meet ups, now has roughly 2,600 members.
The company has an arrangement with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, it started facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin.
Many other potential uses for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been scrapped by now or "put on the shelf," Johnson said.
We're trying to listen to the marketplace.
In the meantime, Katie Chase, the head of strategy for Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and head of the Blockchain Incubator (which is a part of FCAT), is exploring uses for both public blockchain and enterprise blockchain.
Chase could not comment specifically on the projects but said she's seen massive interest from clients and partners, as well as their own employees.
"It's still very nascent.
All of the stuff that you're reading about, if you dig under the covers is still in the proof of concept stage," Chase said.
We tried to apply blockchain to some use cases where we learned a lot but the technology isn't mature enough to solve these problems."
For now, the group is more focused on what some of those barriers are, she said.
They're looking at how to "tokenize" physical items, like a piece of art for example, or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space.
"Those are on the shelf, but we think they'll eventually come off," Chase said.
"Fidelity will be well-equipped when they do."
She used the example of Pebble watch, a failure by retail standards but something that paid off for Fidelity.
Her group had created an app for the smartwatch, which shut down three years after raising millions through a crowdfunded kickstarter campaign.
When the Apple Watch finally came to market, Fidelity was ready.
It used the app developed for Pebble to quickly go live on Apple's new product.
"We were not betting that the Pebble watch is the next big thing - but in case we have people wearing these things on their wrist, we wanted to be there too," she said.
"It gave us the learning for when the smart watch did go to mass market, and we were able to be there."
Earthquake, tsunami strike island of Sulawesi
A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, September 29, triggering a tsunami and leaving nearly 400 people dead.
Hundreds were also injured, and the death toll was expected to rise.
Electricity and communications have been cut off, making it difficult to assess the damage in the city of Palu and nearby fishing community of Donggala, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency says.
California HS students spell racial slur on lettered T-shirts
The Escondido Union High School District this week confirmed that about 10 students at a senior event "made a poor decision" by participating in the stunt involving the racial slur, CNN affiliate KGTV reported.
"We are a campus that prides itself on inclusion and embraces diversity," Principal Adriana Lepe-Ramirez said in a statement.
"We will not tolerate actions that send messages of racism and promote divisiveness."
The statement said Escondido High School, district officials and local police were investigating the incident, the station reported.
"Parents and guardians of the students involved are being contacted by school administrators, and appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken," the statement said.
During the senior picnic, students at the school north of San Diego wear lettered shirts and are photographed spelling out words while standing side by side, the station reported.
The words are usually approved ahead of time but some students spell out their own words after the official photo is taken.
The district statement said the activity was "not aligned with Escondido High School's culture, values or history."
"We all need to understand the power of our words and actions, and we must take responsibility for the decisions we make each and every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"At Escondido High School we will continue to work every day to build a culture of family and unity across our community."
Cade Pannell, a former student who saw the offensive photo on social media, told KGTV the image made him angry.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
"Whether they thought it was a joke, it's not.
And if you do think it's a joke, I think that's very ignorant of you."
Shaquille O'Neal's Son Shareef to Undergo Heart Surgery, Miss 1st Season at UCLA
Shareef O'Neal, son of Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, will miss his freshman season at UCLA because of a heart problem.
Per TMZ Sports, O'Neal will have surgery to correct the issue that was discovered when UCLA doctors were conducting a routine checkup.
"Thank God the UCLA medical staff caught it early," O'Neal told TMZ.
"During rehab, I'll be attending my classes and being a normal student.
I'll be back in no time."
O'Neal officially signed a letter of intent to play at UCLA in August, adding another marquee name to one of the nation's best freshman classes for the 2018-19 season.
"Shareef has made great strides throughout his high school career," Bruins head coach Steve Alford told reporters last month.
"He's an outstanding addition to our incoming class and brings a terrific combination of size, skill and athleticism.
We love the length and height of this year's team, and Shareef is really going to add to that dynamic.
He has a terrific frame, one that will allow him to continue improving on both sides of the floor."
O'Neal, 18, is a 4-star prospect who ranked as the No. 8 power forward and No. 41 overall player in the 2018 recruiting class, per 247Sports.
Before committing to UCLA, O'Neal led Crossroads High School to a 25-9 record during his senior season.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with beating up his father
Track Palin, 28, was arrested on three charges, including assault
Sunday's incident is not his first arrest related to domestic violence
The incident happened at the Palin home in Wasilla, Alaska, where Track Palin bloodied his father, Todd, in a dispute over a truck, according to court records.
The 28-year-old was arrested on three charges, including assault, after the incident Saturday.
The dispute began when he called to say he wanted to come get the truck, and his father refused, according to court documents.
Track Palin was arrested on charges of first-degree burglary, fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal mischief, and his father suffered injuries to his face and head, the court filing shows.
Track Palin called the officers on the scene "peasants" and told them to abandon their weapons when they attempted to communicate with him, the documents say.
At one point, he got onto the garage roof before eventually being detained, the court filing says.
Sarah Palin said her son was "freaking out" and "was on some type of medication," according to the court documents.
Track Palin also told the police he had consumed a few beers earlier, the documents say.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence assault involving a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," the former Republican vice presidential candidate and governor of Alaska said at the time.
"And it makes me realize, more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America's finest that we have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them."
Elizabeth Warren says she think about presidential run after the midterms
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," the Democratic senator told a town hall crowd in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"So here's what I promise: After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."
Warren, who is defending her seat this year against a challenge from Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, had previously downplayed expectations of a run saying she is focused on her work in the Senate.
"It is really important that we focus on midterm elections and stop acting like the only important shiny object in the room is 2020," she told reporters during her speech at the National Press Club in August.
"The important fight coming up right now is midterm election, and that's true in Massachusetts, It's true all across this country."
Warren has long been considered a potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee to take on President Donald Trump.
However, she would likely face a highly contested primary race, as several other high-profile Democrats are mulling runs for the highest office, including former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.
Third mystery death is linked to celebrity mental health clinic in less than a year
An exclusive private psychiatric hospital is believed to have suffered a third suicide in less than a year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.
Shaquelle Vidal, 23, the daughter of a TV comedian, died on April 7 after spending almost a month as a "voluntary" patient at the Nightingale Hospital in Marylebone, West London.
She was the girlfriend of James Lyle, 57, a millionaire hedge fund boss and former Conservative Party donor, who met the five-figure cost for her care.
The trainee chef's death came almost exactly six months after that of socialite and artist Daisy Boyd, 28, the granddaughter of River Cafe co-founder Rose Gray.
Miss Boyd, who had struggled to deal with her split from publishing heir Dan Macmillan, 43, died on October 5 under the influence of cocaine smuggled in by a visitor.
Two months earlier, Alan MacDonald, 61, a film set designer, took his life four days after being discharged from the hospital.
In May, the Care Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale for doing too little to combat "illicit substances" being brought on to the premises.
Shaquelle, the daughter of BBC's Mock The Week panellist Ava Vidal, went into the hospital on March 11.
Katie Gollop QC told a pre-inquest hearing at Westminster Coroner's Court last week that she had gone "AWOL" on March 29 and when she returned a week later, her mental state had deteriorated.
Ms Gollop, acting for Ava Vidal, said: "My client would like to piece together what was happening to Shaquelle... to understand who it was she was in contact with, and what she was doing."
She referred to Mr Lyle as Shaquelle's "boyfriend."
Comedy director John Gordillo, 52, who was described as Shaquelle's "unofficial stepfather," said: "I know Shaquelle was still in contact with James Lyle, and he was based in New York at the time."
Mr Gordillo told the hearing that on April 4 he called the hospital "more than a dozen times" in 20 minutes after Shaquelle rang him to claim she wanted to buy and take cyanide, but that no one answered.
"It seems to me that, had someone picked up during that period, what followed could have been avoided," he added.
On April 5, a doctor at the hospital assessed Shaquelle as being "acutely psychiatrically unwell."
Less than 48 hours later, she hanged herself using a laptop cable.
A Nightingale spokesman extended sympathy to her family and friends and said: "Our hospital is committed to providing high standards of care in a safe and therapeutic environment."

Led Zeppelin face new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff for song Stairway To Heaven
Led Zeppelin facing a new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff from their hit 1971 classic Stairway To Heaven
The British band are accused a plagarising part of their hit song from 1971
Appeals court overruled 2016 verdict group did not copy from band called Spirit
Michael Skidmore, trustee for songs of Spirit guitarist, filed suit back in 2015
The song goes on a bit - and it looks like the plagiarism case surrounding Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven is going to be another long-player.
The band are facing a new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff for their 1971 ballad.
A US appeals court has overruled a 2016 verdict that the group did not copy the opening of their hit from music by the band Spirit.
It was said the judge in the trial had made errors, including misleading jurors about copyright law.
The case was sent back to court.
Michael Skidmore, trustee for the songs of Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, originally filed the suit in 2015.
Police chase ends when Michigan cop runs down murder suspect as he shoots at officers
A Michigan man suspected of murdering his girlfriend has been arrested after leading police on a chase that ended when he was mowed down by a police car.
Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected of shooting dead his girlfriend Tia Mae Randall, 27, Thursday in Wyoming, Michigan.
He was arraigned Friday in a hospital where he is being treated after an officer ran him down with a police SUV as Nolin shot at them while trying to flee on a busy highway.
Nolin has been charged with five felony counts including assault with intent to murder and fleeing police.
'Arraigning at the hospital certainly isn't the norm, but it's not unheard of either,' Wyoming Police Capt. James Maguffee said.
'He is getting the treatment he needs, but we need the wheels of justice to turn.
Judges will often make the accommodations to make that happen.'
The body of Nolin's girlfriend was found Thursday morning at Creekside Estates mobile home.
The mother-of-two was killed by a single gunshot and police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
Police then released an alert for the public to be on lookout for Nolin, giving a broad physical description of him and his 1996 black Dodge pickup truck.
He was spotted in his trick and as police tried to pull him over Nolin hopped onto US 131.
Nolin crashed his truck into a concrete median then got out and ran on foot down the highway.
As he ran, Nolin shot at the officers chasing him.
One cop took the police SUV and ran Nolin down from behind.
The event was captured on video by an onlooker.
He was transported to the hospital where he is in serious but stable condition and will remain until he is discharged and transferred to Kent County Jail.
'It shows the willingness of our police officers in West Michigan to put themselves in harm's way to protect this community,' Maguffee said.
'They got the guy in custody in an appropriate time frame and in an appropriate way and we're very proud of them.'
In all, Nolin is charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder, fleeing police, carrying a concealed weapon and felony use of a firearm.
He has yet to be charged in the death of his girlfriend as the homicide investigation remains active.
'There's absolutely an underlying homicide investigation that continues and we'll be close to wrapping that up and we'll present that to the Kent County prosecutor at the appropriate time,' Maguffee said.
Judge heaps praise on brave homeowner who knocked burglar's teeth out during break-in at his home
A judge has praised a householder who confronted two thugs trying to break into his home - giving him "full marks" for bravery.
Despite one offender swinging a plank of wood at him, 63-year-old David Oldham refused to be cowed.
Instead, the university estates manager fought back, punching both offenders and knocking one of the men's teeth out.
The criminals fled but blood left on Mr Oldham from the scuffle led to one of them, Craig Ford, being identified and arrested four months later.
Sentencing Ford, who lost a tooth after being hit by Mr Oldham outside his £400,000 detached home in Ormskirk, Lancashire, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, told him: "Mr Oldham gave you more than you bargained for because when he confronted you at the side of his house, disguised so only your eyes and nose were visible, he punched you.
And not only did he punch you but when your accomplice, who had been breaking in upstairs, jumped down from the roof he punched him as well.
Jailing Ford for three years and four months on Friday, the judge said: "You've learnt two lessons, I hope.
One is you do not mess with David Oldham, and two, you don't mess with the police.
For your pains in committing these offences you now have one tooth less than you had before and you got bitten by a dog.
It is the least you deserve."
He added: "Full marks to Mr Oldham for the way in which he responded to what you did."
Derek Jones, prosecuting, said that at the time of the burglary, Ford was on licence from a three-year sentence imposed in 2016, also for burglary.
Liverpool Crown Court heard Mr Oldham sprang into action when he heard noises outside his home at about 7pm on April 5.
Mr Jones said: "Mr Oldham, a man of some substance, bravely went out to the side of the property and was confronted by the defendant who moved towards him.
Fearing for his safety he punched him once to the face which knocked him to the floor and also knocked a tooth out.
The other intruder then jumped down from the roof landing in front of Mr Oldham who instinctively punched him to the face."
Mr Jones said the accomplice picked up a plank of wood and swung it at Mr Oldham, and Ford said: "Shoot him, he's knocked my teeth out."
The accomplice said to Mr Oldham: "We'll just leave it now if you let us go," and he and Ford fled the scene.
Police caught up with Ford when they raided a house in Wavertree on August 2.
Ford kicked out at a police dog, which then bit his shoulder.
The second burglar is believed to be still at large.
Ford, 25, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to burglary, assault by beating, and driving dangerously while disqualified and without a licence.
Blow for Boris as Tory activists CLAP attack on him in conference hall
Boris Johnson suffered a blow today as Tory activists clapped a vicious attack on him as 'irrelevant and offensive'.
Despite Mr Johnson wooing the grass roots with his hardline approach to Brexit, the brutal assessment from former trade minister Digby Jones went down well with members at conference in Birmingham this afternoon.
Meanwhile, David Davis swiped that Mr Johnson was focused on 'headlines' rather than sound policies.
And a Cabinet ally of Mrs May added to the woes by telling MailOnline that he was only making so much 'noise' because he did not have the 'numbers' for an all-out leadership bid.
The backlash came after the former foreign secretary launched another vicious attack on the PM's Chequers plan for Brexit - branding it 'deranged' and 'preposterous'.
Mr Johnson upped the ante by pointing out that she was a Remainer during the referendum two years ago - whereas he is a true believer in the project.
And he urged the government to back ambitious projects like building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
But a defiant Mrs May shot back that her critics were 'playing politics' and insisted she is 'not bluffing' about driving a hard bargain with the EU.
Speaking during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show to kick off Tory conference, Mrs May said: 'I do believe in Brexit.'
Lord Jones, a former Labour trade minister who now sits as an independent, pleased the crowd by praising the opportunities of Brexit.
But he prompted applause by referring to alleged remarks by Mr Johnson when he responded 'f*** business' in response to questions about the concerns they have raised.
Without naming Mr Johnson, Lord Jones took aim at the 'irrelevant and offensive person he really is'.
'Business is so important that when I heard a former foreign secretary say "f*** business," it showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is,' he said.
'I take great exception to that.'
Lord Jones also hailed the response by Mrs May - who watched the speech from the hall - to 'bullying' by EU leaders over her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit.
Earlier, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also took aim at Mr Johnson, pointing out that he had stayed as a senior member of the government during the Brexit negotiations.
A Cabinet ally of Mrs May played down the intervention, telling MailOnline that Mr Johnson does not have enough support among Tory MPs to oust the PM.
They said: "It is not that damaging to have stories like this in the papers today.
He is making a lot of noise, but Boris does not have the numbers in the parliamentary party, and he knows that is the case.
There is a big contrast between the respectful stance David Davis has taken, arguing his case, and the way Boris has pursued his own personal ambitions.
Business Secretary Greg Clark lashed Mr Johnson for attacking business for being sceptical about Brexit.
Speaking on the fringes of the Tory conference in Birmingham, Mr Clark said Mr Johnson's jibe was "totally the wrong thing to say."
He said: "I was surprised that anyone could even think like that.
There is no successful economy anywhere in the world that does not have successful and flourishing businesses.
In an interview with Sky News' Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis admitted that the next couple of months would be 'really scary' as the EU tried to force deep concessions from the UK.
But he said the government had to hold its nerve and push for a Canada-style agreement rather than Chequers.
He also delivered a stinging barb when asked about Mr Johnson's attractions as a Tory leader.
Ridiculing Mr Johnson's proposal of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said 'one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas'.
He added: 'We have a very knockabout friendships, but quite a lot of his ideas are good headlines but not good policies.'
Bulgaria spends £80million of European taxpayers' cash on bungled restoration
Bulgaria spends £80million of European taxpayers' cash on making ancient castles look like 'cheese and cardboard' in bungled restoration
The Balkan nation has spent £80million of the EU's Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning to former glory, construction work has made a mockery.
Local government near the Krakra fortress have vowed to undo shoddy work.
The Bulgarian government has spent tens of millions of EU money on botched restoration job on medieval castles.
The Balkan nation has spent £80million of the EU's Regional Development Fund to fix ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of returning them to their former glory, construction work has left them as laughing stocks.
The expensive reconstruction work has left the relics looking like they are made of 'cheese and cardboard' and this has turned tourists off the site.
The medieval for of Krakra in Pernik, western Bulgaria and the Roman fort of Trayanovi Vrata near Ihtiman among others have drawn the ire of conservationists after they were rebuilt with polymer concrete, often used to make pavements.
The Telegraph reported that both the EU and the government have privately admitted that lessons should be learnt from the debacle, according to a report.
'It's weeping - a weeping fortress,' Stella Duleva, a conservation architect, said of the Trayanovi Vrata.
'It had survived 16 centuries, and now it's ruined.'
Such was the backlash of the restoration of the Krakra fort in Pernik that local authorities have said they will dismantle the additions in 2019.
The Pernik fortress has been dubbed 'cardboard castle' because of shoddy moderations.
The Byzantine fort of Yailata has been dubbed 'cheese fortress' after it was rebuilt with smooth white blocks that clash with its weather-worn facade.
The strange debacle comes as the European Union faces fresh scrutiny as to how its development funds are spent.

Hammer thrower, 24, hits out after stranger on a train platform 'body shamed'
A British female athlete has today hit out after being 'body-shamed' by a stranger on a train platform.
Jessica Mayho, who won silver in hammer throwing at this year's British Athletic Championships, says she was abused at Leeds Station on Friday afternoon.
Miss Mayho, aged 24 and standing five feet 11 inches tall, said a man pushed and verbally abused her while she waited for a train.
The attacker then made comments about her 'big body' on the platform just before 5pm.
But the rising athletics star, who is aiming to compete for Team GB at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, confronted the man.
Miss Mayho, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: 'I stood up for myself whilst the rest of the busy platform avoided eye contact.
People like this can scare you and also knock self-confidence but this is MY body and MY machine.'
The young athlete received an outcry of support on social media after posting about her ordeal on Twitter.
Andy Lewis MBE wrote: 'Big body!!!!
Was he drunk or visually impaired?
What a fool, nothing wrong with you Jess.
Don't let one small minded idiot have any of your time.'
Gavin Gray added: 'Find it disgusting.
Not just him but the bystanders who ignored what went on.
Glad you're ok.
You are an inspiration to the next generation.
This says 'Be proud of who you are and if you have a problem with me eff off!.''
Miss Mayho, who works at the University of Leeds, was introduced to the hammer throw as a teenager by one of her older sister's coaches.
She has since claimed second place at the Muller Senior British Athletic Championships held in Birmingham in July this year.
This British silver medal came just a month after she was crowned North of England champion.
She has been approached for further comment but declined.
Facebook faces a fine of up to £1.25billion after at least 50million of its users were hacked
Criminals exploited security flaw to access at least 50million Facebook accounts
But the huge breach was only announced on Friday, three days after it happened
Facebook now bracing itself for a massive fine under new European data laws
Facebook could face a fine of up to £1.25 billion after at least 50million of its accounts were hacked.
Criminals exploited a security flaw to access the accounts, putting huge amounts of sensitive, personal information at risk.
But Facebook only announced the breach on Friday, three days after it happened -and was last night still unable to say how many British accounts had been affected.
As the hunt for the hackers continued, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner - which regulates the web giant's European data compliance as it is headquartered in Dublin - criticised the company, saying: "The notification lacks detail."
Facebook is now bracing itself for a massive fine under new European Union data laws that can require firms to pay out up to four per cent of its global turnover.
Facebook generated £31.2 billion in revenue last year.
The crooks gained access to accounts through Facebook's "view as" feature which allows users to see what their profiles look like when others view them.
The journalist and publisher Vladas Dargis has died
V.Dargis was born on 2 August, 1926 in the village of Pakempiniai in Akmenė district.
At the end of the Second World War, in 1944, avoiding the Soviets, he traveled to the West from Kaunas, where he studied and lived, and in 1947 he settled in England.
In 1992 he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.
In 1952-1957 V.Dargis was the head of the publishing house “Nida Press” in London.
In 1954, he founded the "Nida" book club there and led it until 1957 and again from 1983 to 1991.
The newspaper "British Lithuanian" (later "European Lithuanian") and other publications of Lithuanians in Great Britain were printed at "Nida" book club printing house.
"Nida Book Club" had released the latest works by Lithuanian writers living in the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Germany.
In 1959-1961 V.Dargis worked as the newsreader, director and journalist of the U.S. radio "The Voice of America" (Munich).
V.Dargis worked for the Board of Directors of the Lithuanian House in London for a long time, to which he was elected in 1956-1957, in 1982 he was the director of the press department, in 1984-1986 - the chairman of the board, and in 1984-1987 he was the administrator responsible for the renovation of the Lithuanian publishing house in Great Britain, served as the head of the affairs in the Lithuanian House.
In 1974-1976, V. Dargis was a member of the Lithuanian Union Council in Great Britain (LUCGB), in 1982 he was elected as a member of LUCGB Board for information and communications with divisions, since 1983 he was the Vice-President for Cultural Affairs, and 1985 to 1989 - the Vice-President for Press and Information.
In 1987, V.Dargis became the editor-in-chief of the British Lithuanian weekly "European Lithuanian", and served in this position for almost ten years.
On his initiative, on 9 January, 1990, “European Lithuanian” was first published in Vilnius.
The weekly newspaper was published in the capital of Lithuania from autumn of 1992 and had been reaching Lithuanians in many countries of the world for three years.
At the beginning of 1994, as an addendum to the "European Lithuanian", the monthly "Lithuanian Dreams" was launched on the initiative of V.Dargis and at his own expense, and it was distributed free of charge together with the "European Lithuanian" among the Lithuanians of Belarus.
At the founders' decision, the publication of "European Lithuanian" was returned to Great Britain at the beginning of 1996.
While living in Great Britain, V.Dargis always hoped to return to independent Lithuania, therefore he welcomed the restored independence of Lithuania.
By written word and public activity he did a lot in fostering Lithuanianism, promoting the Republic of Lithuania and contributing to the preservation of its name in the world during the years of occupation.
The family of V.Dargis informed that the viewing of the deceased will take place at the Vilnius Funeral Home, Hall 2 (Olandų St. 22, Vilnius).
A final farewell will take place from 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 November. The burial ceremony will take place on Wednesday, 7 November.
“MG Baltic” case continues with listening to the recordings: the defendants discussed Gabrielius Landsbergis
The hearing started with listening to a recorded conversation (which took place in November, 2015) between the former vice-president of “MG Baltic” Raimondas Kurlianskis and the former labourist Vytautas Gapšys.
From the recording it is difficult to understand exactly what the accused people are talking about.
In fact, it can be heard in the recording that R.Kurlianskis and V.Gapšys are speaking about Christmas festival, and the name of the current leader of the Conservative Party Gabrielius Landsbergis is mentioned several times, but it is difficult to understand exactly what they are talking about.
The allegations are made both to natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, the charges were filed against three legal entities and five natural persons: Labour and Liberal Movement Parties, "MG Baltic" group, former leaders of liberals and labourists: E.Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšys, former member of Parliament and liberal Š.Gustainis, member of Parliament G.Steponavičius and former vice-president of “MG Baltic” R.Kurlianskis.
The Labour Party was accused of bribery and influence peddling, the Liberal Movement was accused of bribery, influence peddling and abuse of power, and "MG Baltic" is suspected in bribing these parties and influence peddling.
Officials suspect that politicians have taken or negotiated bribes with R.Kurlianskis, the former vice-president of “MG Baltic”, and then offered or supported the initiatives in Seimas and other institutions that were favourable to the group.
The former chairman of the Liberal Movement, E.Masiulis, is suspected of influence peddling, bribery and unjust enrichment, the former vice-chairman of this party, G.Steponavičius, is suspected of abuse of power, and a former member of the Vilnius City Council Š.Gustainis - of bribery.
V.Gapšys is suspected of bribery and influence peddling, and R.Kurlianskis - of bribery and influence peddling.
Poll: who has the biggest chance to win in the second round of the presidential election?
The poll regarding the second round of elections included four top candidates: economist Gitanas Nausėda, the Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, who has not proclaimed himself as the candidate, and two candidates who had participated in the initial elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) - Member of the Parliament Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
In fact, on Sunday it turned out that I.Šimonytė received TS-LKD support and V.Ušackas has withdrawn from the election campaign.
According to data, if elections were held in the near future, G.Nausėda would win the second round of the presidential election in all cases, but the head of “Vilmorus”, sociologist Vladas Gaidys says it is too early to make conclusions.
"Nausėda stands out (from others - DELFI), but it is very important to watch, whether we talk about the parties or about people, what is the dynamics.
The double increase for Šimonytė was apparent between the surveys, and there was a halt for Nausėda. Ušackas’ results even decreased.
Thus, this increase is very important”, says sociologist.
In addition, according to the results of the survey, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided who they will vote for, or they are not planning to vote at all.
If I.Šimonytė and S.Skvernelis meet in the second round of presidential elections, the struggle would be tense - 32.7% would vote for I.Šimonytė, and 30.9% for S.Skvernelis.
In fact, even 36.4% of the people said they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know who to vote for, or they would not vote at all.
Sociologist V.Gaidys once again emphasized that we are not seeing a full picture so far, because not all candidates who would apply to the less successful electorate of Lithuania have proclaimed themselves.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, so where are their candidates?
For example, where is a candidate of the social democrats? They had a candidate for 30 years, won’t there be any now?
When they proclaim themselves, it will be clear what are their chances compared with other candidates.
Therefore, the less successful part of Lithuania is less reflected so far”, says V.Gaidys.
In turn, Mažvydas Jastramskis, a political scientist at Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI), says that it's still too early to make conclusions, and all three candidates, excluding V.Ušackas who left the fight, look similar.
"From my research experience, these differences do not mean anything.
A difference of 5 percentage points really does not show the advantage of any candidate.
The only thing I could see that Nausėda would look good against Ušackas (...) again, bearing in mind that if those people actually came to vote.
Nausėda also looks good against Skvernelis, but we are comparing apples and potatoes now, because, for example, Nausėda has already announced that he will participate, and Skvernelis has not.
Moreover, the poll took part before the initial elections by conservatives, how would it look after the elections?", says a political scientist.
According to him, G.Nausėda has a small advantage, but once all candidates have proclaimed themselves, it can decrease.
"The situation is quite similar.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - the results are quite even.
I would like to remind you that Roland Paksas had a 5% support half a year before the 2003 presidential election, and then he won the election.
It's not possible to make any predictions", says Jastramskis.
DELFI reminds that candidates for the presidential elections so far are the following: economist G.Nausėda, member of the Parliament I.Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist and member of the Parliament Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Movement Petras Auštrevičius, member of the Parliament Naglis Puteikis and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accused Israel of trying to launch a cyberattack
“A regime, whose record in using cyber weapons is clear from cases such as (spreading) Stuxnet (computer virus), has tried this time to damage Iran’s communication infrastructure,” said Information Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi on his Twitter account.
He was referring to “Stuxnet” virus attack in 2010, which damaged nuclear facilities in Iran.
It is believed that this malware have been developed by Israel and the United States.
“Thanks to vigilance of our technical teams, they returned empty-handed.
We will follow up this hostile action through international forums,” said M.J. A.Jahromi.
His deputy, Hamid Fattahi, said that technical teams had intercepted multiple attempts to infiltrate their systems early on Monday, and attackers had been “strongly warded off”.

The accident happened at around 10.40 a.m.
The man (born in 1945), who was swimming in the pool, suddenly felt ill and submerged under water.
The man was quickly removed from the water, but he was already unconscious.
It was attempted to resuscitate him.
The ambulance arrived shortly, and the medical personnel also tried to resuscitate him, however, they did not succeed in saving his life.
He died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.
Antanas Sakalauskas, head of the wellness club "Impuls", commented on the accident.
"According to our information, a 73-year-old man visited our wellness club on Fabijoniškių street together with his wife on Monday morning.
The client was swimming in the pool for about 30 minutes, then he stopped to have a rest at the rope separating the lanes of the pool, and after a few minutes suddenly collapsed.
The people nearby - the client who was swimming in the common lane and the guard of the pool - reacted immediately, pulled him out of the water and started to resuscitate.
The man was being resuscitated up to the arrival of the ambulance.
The club’s employees immediately called for emergency medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
The medical personnel restored the man’s pulse and respiration, and transferred him to the ambulance.

We express our sincere condolences to the deceased man’s family for their loss.
According to the preliminary data, the incident could be caused by the client’s health problems.
According to the information submitted to the general practitioners, he had diabetes.
We would like to remind that in case of serious health problems, it is always very important to evaluate one’s possibilities responsibly and to consult with doctors as well as specialists in wellness clubs.
There is a guard in the pool premises of all wellness clubs, whose main task is to watch the pool, its access, and to ensure safety of the clients; he is distinguished from other employees by bright clothes.
Such pool guards have radio stations, and can immediately contact the administration and reception, respond to their inquiries or call for help.

According to LNK press release, the Lithuanian lost her right to take care of her son and to see him four years ago based on the decision of the Norwegian Child Welfare Services "Barnevernet” and the courts.
The woman’s story has caused an international scandal followed by the media.
Citizens organized pickets both in Lithuania and Norway regarding the boy’s return to Lithuania to his grandmother.
However, publicity did not help Gražina and her family to get back the son who has Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, the woman tells how she has been living separated from her son for the last few years, and how the meetings between her and her child take place after a two-year break.
At the time when Gražina was deprived of the right to take care of her son, the boy was 8, today he is 12, at the start of adolescence.
For the first two years Gražina did not see her son at all, it was forbidden.
Later, Gražina was given the right to see her son twice a year, for only one hour.
At the last court hearing, which took place several months ago, the number of meetings was increased to three times a year, and extended to two hours.
Each time, meetings with the son resemble visits to a penitentiary - they are being watched by officers, and going to the meetings reminds of a secret operation.
"The son has changed four families already and no longer speaks Lithuanian", Gražina will open her heart this Tuesday evening; her story on a TV show on LNK.
Eligijus Masiulis will not get the money that was confiscated during the search
The Court of Appeal announced on Tuesday that it would reject the complaint of the defendant’s lawyer.
The order is final and can not be appealed.
E.Masiulis, the former leader of the Liberal Movement, who is tried in a political corruption case, approached the Court of Appeal, asking to return his personal money that was taken from his and his spouse's wallets during the search.
In total, more than 242,000 euros were taken from E.Masiulis during the searches.
This money is subject to a temporary restriction of ownership right which is continuously renewed.
The restriction was last extended by Vilnius District Court on October 15.
E. Masiulis did not ask the Court of Appeal to return all the money – he wants to get 800 euros that were taken from his spouse’s wallet as well as 690 euros, 130 pound sterlings and 1,600 US dollars taken from his wallet.
Former politician says that the money was intended for the planned trip to the USA.
E. Masiulis’ lawyer Mindaugas Bliuvas, at the Court of Appeal on Monday, asked for the return of the money, as the spouses had well-paid jobs and could have such amounts of money.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to reject the complaint.
"The decision of the Vilnius District Court is legal and valid, there is no further restriction on the property specified in the accusations.
The court have justly stated that it had formed the basis for confiscation of the property as well as the extended confiscation of the property", said J.Laucius at the hearing.
On October 15, Vilnius District Court decided not to return more than 242,000 euros to E.Masiulis, the accused in the political corruption case.
This money was found during searches at home and in the car of the former politician who is accused of corruption.
The panel of three judges stated that it was clear from the file that the ownership rights were restricted only to the funds that constitute the subject of the criminal offenses incriminated to E.Masiulis.
"Given the scope of the restriction, it follows that the ownership right of the accused is not restricted in a disproportionate manner or that the restriction has been applied for too long," stated judges Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčienė and Ugnius Trumpulis in their decision.
The judges pointed out that E.Masiulis was charged with serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex, therefore, in order to ensure possible confiscation of the property and extended confiscation of the property, it is necessary to extend the temporary restriction of the defendant's property.
Prosecutors state that Raimondas Kurlianskis, the former vice president of “MG Baltic”, gave a bribe of 106,000 euros to E.Masiulis for taking decisions at the Seimas that are beneficial to the group.
Both defendants say that money found at E.Masiulis - 90,000 euros - was a loan from R.Kurlianskis.
According to the case, 242,400 euros, 130 pound sterlings and 1,600 US dollars were found at E.Masiulis during the searches.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer tried to recover the money more than once, but the courts rejected their requests.
Former politician has said that part of these funds belong to other individuals and were to be invested in real estate, or that it was his family's money.
He also argued that there is no evidence that the funds were received in a criminal way.
In the past, the Court of Appeal had declared that the charges against E.Masiulis show that the money could have been received when he was accepting the bribe, which was more than 100,000 euros.
Law enforcement claims that the remaining cash taken during the search could have been obtained from undefined sources of income, could be not declared, not confirmed by the documents and not legal.
The charges in the political corruption case were filed against three legal entities - the Labor Party, the Liberal Movement, and “MG Baltic”.
In addition to E.Masiulis, charges were also filed against former labourist Vytautas Gapšys, former member of the Parliament and liberal Šarūnas Gustainis, member of the Parliament Gintaras Steponavičius and former vice-president of “MG Baltic” Raimondas Kurlianskis.
R. Kurlianskis is accused of bribing former members of the Parliament E.Masiulis, Š.Gustainis and V.Gapšys.
Americans detected dangerous maneuvers of the Russian fighter
During a 25-minute intercept, the US Navy said the Russian SU-27 sped directly past the front of the aircraft.
The Russian jet flew past it a second time, applying its afterburner while conducting a banking turn away.
Passengers reported turbulence during the first pass and vibrations during the second.
While the Russian military is within its right to exercise within international airspace, this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect them to behave within international standards set to ensure safety and to prevent incidents, including the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (INCSEA), says US Navy in its report.
“Unsafe actions‎ increase the risk of miscalculation and potential for collisions”, it is noted in the report.
Russia's Ministry of Defense acknowledged the incident, however, it stated that the SU-27 kept a “safe distance” from the American plane.
Parent’s expenses are not declining: up to 50 euros per month is spent for extra-curricular activities
According to the survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company “Baltijos tyrimai”, a poll carried out at the end of August revealed that this year one third (32%) of parents spent less than 100 euros on the purchases for one school-age child before going back to school, one fifth (21%) spent 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) - 151 to 200 euros, and less than one fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros at the end of the summer to prepare their child for school.
Parents, whose children started their first year of school, spent about 220 euros on average on their child’s school necessities, while other parents, whose children had already completed first grade, allocated less money for their child - about 160 euros on average.
However, spending does not decrease as the school year continues, as parents often have to spend on their children's activities and tutors.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the cost for one activity varies from 20 to 100 euros in the country.
Parents, who have schoolchildren, were asked to tell the average amount they plan to spend on one child's extra-curricular activity per month.
One quarter (23%) of the respondents was planning to spend up to 20 euros per month on a child's extra-curricular activity, another quarter (26%) claimed they would pay up to 50 euros; three out of ten (31%) would spend between 50 and 100 euros per month for a child's extra-curricular activity, and one sixth (17%) of parents indicated that they plan to spend 100 euros or more.
In fact, school-age children in Lithuania receive a non-formal education basket, which is 15 euros per month.
However, the money can only be used for one activity, and if the cost of the activity is higher, the difference must be paid by the parents.
If a child attends several activities or there are several schoolchildren in a family, the cost of extra-curricular activities can double.
Justina Ambrasienė, marketing manager of the consumer credit company “Vivus.lt”, says that saving money for children’s activities can be a big challenge for families with low or average income, especially if there are several children in the family.
At the beginning of the school year, parents were thinking where to get money for exercise books, stationery or new sportswear.
Now the main concern is how to keep children busy after school without spending a lot of money.
We notice that parents' expenses especially increase in August, when it is necessary to get ready for the new academic year, but later they also remain higher than during the summer, as parents tend to invest in the activity of their offspring.
Often, when they lack funds and after responsible assessment of their possibilities, they even decide to borrow", says J.Ambrasienė.

Today, the fourth exhibit of the mobile street exhibition "Bye old things, hello new things" is running on the streets of Kaunas - the old trolleybus was decorated with a drawing and the inscription “Sienografo užrašai”.
A new fun trolleybus was announced by Kaunas City Municipality.
“This old “Škoda” has also changed its boring green color to a much more colorful and distinctive look.
It is also a participant of the exhibition "Bye old things, hello new things", explained municipality representatives next to the uploaded photo.
The exhibition of mobile street art "Bye old things, hello new things" is dedicated to parting with the old trolleybuses that will be replaced by new ones next year.
Next year, the old “Škoda” trolleybuses will go to well-deserved retirement, and will be replaced by 85 new and modern “Solaris” trolleybuses.
The portal reminds that the first trolleybus with street drawings appeared on the streets of Kaunas a month ago.
Several well known accents of Kaunas street art are shown on the trolleybus - the old man's tobacco pipe and the elephant.
Within a week after the first appearance, the second creation of street artist Timotiejus Norvila - Morfai went out to Kaunas streets.
A fun yellow car is painted on the trolleybus, often referred to simply as a "beetle".
"The idea was to make the trolleybus site-specific.
This drawing looks very entertaining, especially because it matches with the wheels of the trolleybus.
When the wheels roll, it appears to be a part of that car.
When we painted the wheels in white, we made them look like retro style, and the whole combination became very harmonized.
While the trolleybus’ tires were not painted, it was definitely not so charming”, the street artist told the portal “kauno.diena.lt” earlier.
On October 27, the magnificent drawing also appeared on the third trolleybus.
It is painted in white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.
This colour is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body there is one of the houses on K. Donelaičio street, and on the right is the central post office.
“The “Beetle” is still my favourite”, said Morfai while painting the third trolleybus.
Going to buy new ones
“Kauno diena” reminds that last week Kaunas public transport company “Kauno autobusai” signed a 29.4 million contract with the Polish company “Solaris Bus & Coach S.A.” stating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
"Kaunas has invested the largest amount in public transport renewal in its entire history.
This agreement will allow to replace the old trolleybuses of the “Škoda” brand, which has been serving us for many years, and to offer the most comfortable services to our passengers.
New low-floor modern trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient cabin air conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver’s workplace.
The new technology and parallel upgrade of the contact network as well as street repair will allow trolleybuses to run more reliably and much faster.
And, of course, modern trolleybuses will improve the image of the city", said Mindaugas Grigelis, General Manager of “Kauno autobusai”.
First new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited Meghan Markle’s mother to spend Christmas together
Duchess Meghan has charmed the British Royal Palace.
This is proved by the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: The British monarch invited Doria Ragland, the mother of the Duchess of Sussex, to her Sandringham House for Christmas, announced the British media.
Even the parents of the Duchess Kate had never had such an honor.
Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton and her other family members have so far been invited only to the traditional Christmas service with the royal family.
An undisclosed source revealed to the newspaper “Sunday Express” that invitation to Doria Ragland is “a sign of Queen’s respect for Meghan”.
It is said that Doria fascinated the Queen during the royal wedding in May with “her calm”.
An invitation to celebrate Christmas together fueled talks that D.Ragland plans a longer stay in Great Britain.
It is speculated that she wants to help her daughter before and after childbirth.
Meghan and her husband Prince Harry should have their firstborn in spring of 2019.
Exhibition “Woman’s World” is coming back to "Žalgiris" arena
With the autumn routine and more savage weather, the exhibition "Women's World" that is being organized for the 16th time makes one feel impatient - women declare a long weekend, because four days of the hottest fashion, style and beauty news are coming - on November 8-11, in Kaunas "Žalgiris" arena.
Over the years, the face of the event has changed, and the exhibition no longer means an ordinary shopping, but the tradition of having time to oneself.
Often it becomes the place to meet friends and a reason to spend a day with sister or mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn how to shine everyday, find the irreplaceable products, hear or try out various procedures that stop the aging process of the skin.
All this, and more, is promised by 415 participants of the exhibition who will wait for the visitors on all three floors of the arena.
For three days, workshops will be held on beauty and health topics, and on Sunday women will hear tips on creating an exclusive image from the lips of stylist and blogger Viktorija Šaulytė.
Many women in business face situations, when stress impairs stable emotional and physical condition.
For this reason, Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and its Women's Business Network had the idea to hold a conference “Entrepreneurial And Happy. No stress”, where discussions and practical examples will encourage to help oneself in tense situations and to look at life more creatively.
Like every year, the exhibition is full of events for the masters of beauty.
The long-term partners of the exhibition, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Specialists, will give an opportunity to study hair dyeing and modeling subtleties from the international academy "Vinokurov & friends" and their charismatic duo - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas for two days.
For those who want to make a further progress, a bridal image creation contest and competition of masters “Art Battle” will be held, which will not leave anyone indifferent.
A cherry on a cake will be a celebratory fiesta "Happy Birthday, Lithuania" held by the representatives of the beauty world for the 100th anniversary, where one can admire a never-before-seen show - from body painting to dancing.
Another tradition of the "Woman's World" will not be forgotten - the presentation of the latest designers’ collections at "Fashion and Beauty Show" on Friday, where the most stylish people will gather.
And those who like handicrafts will be welcome at the "Dekostudija" creative workshop, where they can create original articles for home interior or to decorate gifts in a more interesting way.
On the last day of the exhibition, all long-haired ladies are especially welcome, as the traditional contest “LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018” will be held, where the new record of the longest hair is recorded annually.
Prime Minister: the salary of teachers has increased by 117 euros after the introduction of full-time payment
Since the introduction of full-time payment model in September, the average salaries of full-time teachers of the country have increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It's too early to say how many advantages or disadvantages it (new order - BNS) has.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their salaries grew by more than 117 euros on average”, said S.Skvernelis to the journalists at the Government on Monday.
He called the plans of the Lithuanian Education Employees Trade Union (LEETU) to go on strike regarding the full-time payment "a democratic right", but emphasized that strike should not interfere with the educational process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permissible and possible.
If they think that the strike is necessary - it is their right to decide.
Again, we would not want this to impact children and pupils.
If there is a strike, this must be done in accordance with the applicable law", said S.Skvernelis.
In June, Seimas approved a model of full-time payment for teachers, which is being introduced in phases since September.
Payment for teachers by a lesson was changed by hourly payment - a teacher's full-time job is 1512 hours a year.
Teacher's working hours are divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
The union led by Andrius Navickas calls this reform an absurd, they are angry that it was adopted on the basis of the "bulldozer" principle and announced an indefinite strike that would start on November 12.
LEETU demands the immediate abandonment of this "minute" salary system and the introduction of a full-time model with a maximum of 18 contact hours per post.
Also, to increase the fixed part of the salary by 20%, and to reduce the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of teaching funds has been criticized, because, according to the trade union, there are not enough funds for home schooling, dividing classes into groups, qualification, education aid, and the classes in large cities remain overfilled.
The Ministry of Education and Science argued that full-time payment for teachers' work will help to regulate the workload of teachers and compensate for all work for the school community.
It is anticipated that work for the community can make up to half of all hours per year in a teacher's full-time employment, which would constitute up to 40 percent of all hours in the first two years of work.
It is established that the teachers' working time per week is 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact hours per week are required for teaching mandatory subject (subjects).
In May, about fifty secondary schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions, and about 1 thousand teachers participated in a two-hour strike initiated by LEETU.
In total, there are about 53 thousand teachers in Lithuania.
Calls to be ready: the crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown in the economic growth and even a crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than the decade ago, said Vitas Vasiliauskas, the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, in a broadcast “The Position Of Business” of the radio station "Žinių radijas".
"I cannot say that the crisis is already around the corner, but there are signs of a slowdown in the economy.
This year, our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, and next year we plan a 2.8 percent growth.
The main message that I would like to say to the public and business is to be ready for everything", said V.Vasiliauskas.
In his opinion, no crisis is the same, so the preparation for them must be different.
Then, during the crisis a decade ago, the government thought that the revenue generated by the emerging economy would be eternal, and the expenditure was planned accordingly.
Therefore, in 2008, following a crisis, there was a dramatic reduction in costs.
Now, according to V.Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the preparation for crisis is better.
"It is true, we see that the assessment of the situation between the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already exceeding the potential and need to press on the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so", said the chairman of the board of the Bank of Lithuania.
V.Vasiliauskas assesses the readiness of the authorities of the country for the coming crisis 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, being such small and open, Lithuanian economy is very strongly influenced by external factors.
The current hustle of the big elephants - the USA, China, and European Union - will surely impact us, too.
Therefore, we need to be very careful.
It is possible to say that we can solve everything in a small economy, but I do not believe it", said V.Vasiliauskas.
What to expect in the future for those who have big loans?
According to V.Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly arranged a short-term strategy, and changes in interest-rate decisions can be expected not earlier than in the summer of the next year: "At the moment, the main goal is to try to manage expectations."
The trend, which is the most worrisome to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is a decrease in labor force in our country.
"The decrease in labor force also largely determines the loss of economic competitiveness.
In addition, it is a decrease in bread eaters.
Migration this year has somewhat balanced this process, but it is unclear whether this is a long-term trend", says Vasiliauskas.
ELTA reminds that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow 3.4% this year, and 2.8% next year.
Swedish conservative leader will try to form government again
The leader of Sweden's conservative Moderates party will get a second chance to form a government, the speaker of parliament said on Monday, two months after elections produced political deadlock.
Ulf Kristersson's Moderates are part of the centre-right four-party Alliance which received marginally fewer votes on September 9 elections than the previous governing centre-left coalition.
Both blocs have struggled to form a majority after refusing to make a deal with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which has roots in the neo-Nazi movement.
U.Kristersson failed in his first bid to form a government on October 14.
Outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Lofven then said he had also failed on October 29.
In a bid to force the parties to reach an agreement, speaker Andreas Norlen said he would propose U.Kristersson to the parliament as a candidate for prime minister next week, pushing the issue to a vote for the first time since the efforts began to form a government.
"It's not clear in advance whether various parties are going to accept Ulf Kristersson as prime minister," A.Norlen told reporters.
But he stressed that "the process must move forward, the dynamics between the parties has to change.”
“The fruitless talks must come to an end", he added.
The date for parliament's vote is not yet known, but A. Norlen said November 14 was a possibility.
In Sweden, the speaker has four attempts to task a candidate to form a government that parliament will accept.
If all four attempts fail, then Sweden must hold new elections.
Nominating U.Kristersson is A.Norlen's third attempt.
U.Kristersson is under pressure from some sections of the Moderates and from Alliance partner the Christian Democrats to accept support from the far-right Sweden Democrats to obtain a majority, but he has so far ruled that out.
The Sweden Democrats, who won 17.6% of votes in the election and are the third-biggest party, have long been ignored by all mainstream parties.
The far-right party, which successfully used the voters' anger over immigration through the elections, after the arrival of almost 400 thousand asylum seekers since 2012, require influence in decision-making in exchange for the support.
But two other Alliance members, the Liberals and Centre Party, are vehemently opposed to that idea.
S.Lofven's Social Democrats, who have governed since 2014 with the Greens and with the informal support of the Left, have meanwhile opened the door for a cross-bloc cooperation, but only if he retains the post of prime minister.
The Alliance and Sweden Democrats have rejected that option.
Afghan government delegation to attend peace talks in Russia
Kabul’s government delegation will attend international talks on the war-torn country in Russia this month, officials said on Monday.
Taliban is still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it would host such conference on November 9 in Moscow, even as the United States tries to engage the Taliban in bilateral talks to end the 17-year conflict.
Afghanistan's High Peace Council, a government body responsible for reconciliation efforts with the militants, would send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, spokesman Sayed Ihsan Taheri told news agency AFP.
The Afghan foreign ministry, however, remained evasive about whether it would dispatch a delegation to the conference, which will focus on kickstarting peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
"We are still negotiating with the Russian officials," spokesman Sebaghtullah Ahmadi said. "We welcome any peace effort that is Afghan-led."
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the militant group was still considering whether to go.
Moscow has also invited representatives from the United States as well as India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet republics in Central Asia.
Pakistan, which has long been accused of providing support to the Afghan Taliban, would "definitely attend”, foreign ministry spokesman Muhammad Faisal told AFP.
The US embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Moscow meeting was initially scheduled to take place in September, but was postponed after Kabul insisted that the process should be Afghan-led.
The meeting comes at a sensitive time.
Newly appointed US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been trying to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate an end to the war, and there are fears the Russian multi-lateral meeting could derail those efforts.
A US government watchdog said last week that Kabul government's control of Afghanistan had slipped in recent months.
Cuban president meets North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, both hoping to get out from under U.S. economic sanctions, have agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations, North Korea’s state media reported Monday.
M. Diaz-Canel, who is in Asia on his first international tour since assuming office in April, arrived in Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
He was met at the airport by Kim Jong Un, who joined him on the ride into the city past cheering crowds.
North Korea’s state media reported that the leaders held negotiations at the Paekhwawon State Guest House, stressed their shared socialist history and vowed continued solidarity.
The official media did not offer many details, but said the talks proceeded in a friendly atmosphere.
The meeting with Kim Jong Un could be seen as a warning for Washington, which has been experiencing an increasing difficulty in its efforts to ensure significant progress on North Korea’s denuclearization issue.
Pyongyang, which has also been quietly cozying up to Moscow recently, has been hardening its rhetoric before the meeting in New York later this week between the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea main negotiator, Kim Yong Chol.
Over the weekend, Pyongyang used its official media to criticize the US for its continued sanctions - a political tool also extensively used by Washington on Cuba and Russia.
North Korea hinted it may resume nuclear development if Washington doesn’t change is tune.
Sanctions has been an important issue on M.Diaz-Canel’s agenda.
During his visit in Moscow last week, M.Diaz-Canel discussed a nearly 50 million dollar (43,8 million euro) arms deal with Russia, and won a similar vow of expanded political, economic and military ties from Vladimir Putin.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement denouncing U.S. “interference into domestic affairs of sovereign nations.”
The U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, initially imposed in 1958 and subsequently expanded, has remained in place.
Russia faced a dire U.S. and EU sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.
M. Diaz-Canel is to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will visit China, Vietnam and Laos.
Cars are not safe in storage sites?
On Saturday, a woman approached police officers asking to investigate this fraud.
According to the resident of Klaipėda, she left her “Hyundai Santa Fe” car made in 2006 at the end of September for storage at the site.
She noticed advertising online on November 3.
It turned out that the fraud sought to sell her vehicle for 3,800 euros.
According to the owner, the theft of the car is possible.
The man born in 1989 was trying to sell the vehicle.
According to police data, the person is not the owner of the site.
An investigation is conducted to investigate the circumstances of the crime.
Firefighters announced that on Sunday evening, at about 22 o'clock, the fire started on Bandužių street, on the seventh floor of the apartment building.
Garbage and a sofa was burning in the one-room apartment.
The owner was taken out of the apartment and examined by doctors, police said.
Scorched and smoldering things were thrown out of the apartment through the window.
During the fire, the staircase was damaged by the smoke on the seventh floor.
Record: the athlete swam around Britain in 157 days
British athlete has stepped ashore on the beach in England becoming the first person to swim around the coast of Great Britain.
A 33-year-old Ross Edgley spent 157 days in the water and covered 2,883 kilometres.
He swam in six-hour stints, sleeping in his support boat.
He was joined for the final mile by hundreds of fellow swimmers.
R.Edgley came ashore at Margate in southeast England - the spot where he began his journey on June 1.
The athlete, who had hoped to finish in 100 days, told his family members who gathered on the beach to greet him: "Sorry I'm late."
He said his main feeling on walking up the beach was relief.
“I was really worried that my legs would give way", said the athlete.
The World Open Water Swimming Association says R.Edgley encountered wild weather and was stung by jellyfish 37 times during this endurance challenge, which was sponsored by the energy drink Red Bull.
The organizers announced that R.Edgley doubled the record for the longest sea swim with breaks that until now was 73 days.
He also set the record for the fastest swim between Great Britain's southernmost and northernmost points, Land's End and John O'Groats.
The athlete completed this distance in 62 days.
Macabre secret of Kleboniškis forest: one suspect is already detained
It was a horrible finding of a passer-by, because the murdered person was not buried deep.
This was the only way to find out about the crime, since the victim of the murderers had no relatives and his missing was not reported.
According to the preliminary data, he had reached the age of adulthood not long ago.
Alike the suspects of his murder.
The Kaunas District Court allowed to arrest one of them for three months.
The second, who is suspected to have escaped abroad, where he is hiding from punishment for another crime, is still being sought.
Until he is found, law enforcement officers are reluctant to comment on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would agree with many things for my children
The group of the most prominent national artists appearing in the new rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the team of artists with one of the most important roles - famous woman will play the role of Juliet's nanny.
Povilas Meškėla, who will take care of the singing of artists, became an important part of the team.
“I think there are many and very beautiful love stories created since Shakespeare's times, but “Romeo and Juliet” will likely remain the symbol of these stories forever, and will be produced on different stages for a long time.
It will be interesting to become a part of one of these productions”, says I.Valinskienė about the new challenge.
Although this famous woman is well-known on the stage and has created many roles in various plays or musicals, she has not yet played a nanny.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed", smiles I.Valinskienė.
When the time was right, I would have gladly accepted such a proposal."
In fact, the character of a nanny in W.Shakespeare's drama is no less important, and some critics even consider it to be the most significant.
A nanny is not only a mediator, a helper - her character and the tone of speech, a feminine approach to feelings, and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives the plot more and different colors.
Moreover, the nanny is also important because she is one of only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The nanny’s character is not very close to my temper and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a different character than yourself is a fun part of the creative process.
So far, I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation", says I.Valinskienė, and she reveals that she would probably had done the same if she was Juliet's nanny.
“I think, the nanny listened to her heart.
Many women do that.
I would probably do the same.”
The legendary rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" by Kęstutis Antanėlis is created according to the famous drama "Romeo and Juliet" by W.Shakespeare.
The production, which is based on real facts, tells the tragic love story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of the story is determined by the conflict that has an unclear origin between the families of the young people - the Montague and the Capulet.
"At all times, all stories are possible.
There have always been and will be parents who are against the choice of the children.
Only today solutions to such problems are more diverse”, replies future nanny I.Valinskienė to the question, whether the story of Romeo and Juliet could repeat itself today.
For my children, I would agree with many things, also with daughters-in-law."
Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justinas Jarutis will play the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the rock opera produced by director and actor Ramūnas Cicėnas; Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas will also perform on the stage.
The new rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first to see a newly produced legendary work will be the audience at “Siemens” arena on December 28.
A day later, on December 29, the rock opera will be shown in the "Švyturys" arena in Klaipėda.

"We will try to get first points in the League of Nations, although we are facing very difficult duels in the rival fields.
At home, we lost with the minimum difference to the Serbs and the Romanians.
There was also a lack of success.
We hope to take revenge during the away match.
Though for the rivals these are decisive battles for the first place in the group and the opportunity to continue the fight for the right to compete in the European Championship", said Lithuanian national team coach E.Jankauskas.

Skamp presents a song whose video has already been turned down by one TV
“Skamp”, the band which is celebrating the 20th anniversary, started actively making music again this year.
Announcing a single anniversary concert "Skamp20" on December 26 in “Siemens” arena in Vilnius, the famous trio presents new works one after the other.
This time it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a brave song video clip.
"This song is about love, so I thought that the video should demonstrate all types of relationship, regardless of age or sexual orientation", says Erica Jennings about the idea of a new song and video clip, and she is convinced that any manifestation of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
In the video of "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" there are more than ten couples of different orientation and age: "We have always supported the LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will not need to discuss it", says Victor Diawara, who created the music at the beginning of the year during family vacation in Israel.
In fact, because to this video, “Skamp” have already received negative reactions - one of the country's most popular broadcasters refused it.
This tells a lot about our society.
TV will not show the video because it shows people kissing and it is supposedly inappropriate content for children.
And what about the fact that any time when you turn on the TV you can see fights and other examples of violence on the screen. Is it the right content?", asks E.Jennings rhetorically.
Vilius Alesius agrees with Erica: "It would be nice to see more people who are holding hands and kissing, regardless their social status, gender or age.
We have children and we want them to grow in an environment with more tolerance and less bullying.
We want to brighten the day of the audience and make them smile with a new song and video clip.”
"Skamp" has been known for courageous song texts since 1998, speaking on unpopular or sensitive topics.
All the best songs of the band - old and new - will sound loud and wide at the “Skamp20” concert on December 26 in “Siemens” arena in Vilnius.
Everyone is welcome with their families, and children under 10 years of age can enter free of charge.
An accident near the overpass of the clinical hospital: a cyclist suffered injuries

The officer on duty at Kaunas Police confirmed to the portal that there was a traffic accident near the overpass of the clinical hospital, at the intersection of Utenos and Eivenių streets.
During the accident a car and a cyclist collided.
According to the representative of Kaunas ambulance, a person who rode a bicycle suffered injuries during the accident.
Luckily, there were no severe injuries and no open wounds on the body.
A victim was examined by doctors at the site of the accident.
Drivers report that because of the accident it may be difficult to cross this road section.
President’s Office: LRT is not a property of politicians
While Seimas considers returning to the deliberations of the commission investigating the activities of LRT, the President’s Office fears that the governing party simply seeks to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians", said Mindaugas Lingė, the advisor of the President, to "Žinių radijas".
However, the advisor emphasized that it is possible to see an opposite process.
"It is possible to see that there is a wish to have more of this (political - ELTA) influence.
Therefore, we appraise this rather critically”, said M.Lingė.
According to him, the proposals of Seimas’ LRT commission are questionable and of doubtful legality, since they are aimed at the independence of the broadcaster.
However, M. Lingė emphasized, improvement of LRT management is necessary, and this should be done with expert assistance as well as by identifying concrete aspects that interfere with the smooth functioning of LRT.
He stressed that international institutions are already emphasizing that the activity of LRT should be supervised not by political, but competent institutions.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the commission investigating the activity of LRT.
These conclusions have received a lot of criticism.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT were evaluated very skeptically - to reduce the powers of the Council and to relate the terms of office of its members to the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
The European Broadcasting Union has considered this and expressed their concerns.
The opposition group of Seimas members appealed to the Constitutional Court in January on whether the special parliamentary commission investigating the activities and finances of LRT is not in conflict with the Constitution.
Good news for working abroad from R.Karbauskis
Seimas began to consider amendments to the Law on the Declaration of Residence, submitted by Ramūnas Karbauskis, Senior Member of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, according to which citizens, who work and pay taxes outside Lithuania, would be exempted from compulsory health insurance tax.
After the submission of the draft on Tuesday, it was supported by 56 members of the Seimas, 9 were against, 25 members of the Parliament abstained.
After consideration in the committees, the draft is scheduled for consideration in the Seimas plenary meeting on December 6. The Seimas also decided to ask for the Government's conclusion.
Under the proposed project, persons who pay social security contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the countries of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, are exempted from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the decision of the State Social Insurance Fund Administration.
Those who live and work outside Lithuania, according to the data provided and approved by the State Social Insurance Fund Board (“Sodra”) and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered as departed from Lithuania.
Services not used by a person are considered.
“There are additional opportunities to know the fact that a person is departed”, R.Karbauskis explained at the Seimas.
According to Antanas Matulas, Conservative Member of the Seimas, the proposed legal regulation would be unfair for citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
“A part of the Lithuanians living abroad are misusing it”, A.Matulas remarked.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas believes that thus we encourage the citizens to abandon the obligation.
In his opinion, it would be possible for the cheaters to use the health care system free of charge.
After the proposed amendments to the law, people, who have departed to live in other countries and pay social insurance contributions there, will not accumulate debts, and it will reduce the burden of administration of “Sodra” debt.
At present, Lithuanian citizens, who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared the departure in the Register of the Citizens according to the procedure established by legal acts, have to pay compulsory health insurance (CHI) contributions each month, and if they do not pay, the debt is accumulated.
A.Duonėla convicted of fraud, but acquitted of forgery
Vilnius Regional Court upheld the verdict for an attempt to commit fraud for the former prominent sportsman Alvydas Duonėla, but he was acquitted of forgery of documents.
The court verdict, announced on Monday, became effective immediately.
A.Duonėla was sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years, postponing the enforcement of the sentence.
The multiple Lithuanian champion of kayaking and rowing was sentenced by the Vilnius City District Court in March this year.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years.
The Vilnius District Court, having examined the case in accordance with the appeal, withdrew one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay nearly 760 euros to the Crime Victims Foundation.
The Prosecutor’s Office accused A.Duonėla of having falsified a bill in 2013 regarding a loan of 200,000 litas (about 58,000 euros) to the dentist's office “Dalecija” managed by his former wife Dalia Burokaitė.
The spouse learned about this only in December 2016 when she received calls to pay her debt.
The former spouse said she had never borrowed money from her husband for the clinic and did not sign the bill.
According to the judges of Vilnius District Court, there are no objective data in the case proving that it was A.Duonėla who had entered data that did not correspond to reality that, allegedly, UAB “Dalecija” owes A.Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
It is agreed with the arguments set out in the complaint of the sentenced person and his counsel, that there is no objective evidence of this in the case.
Thus, having established that A.Duonėla only used a forged document for deception and having recognized that this attribute - the use of a forged document - is an integral part of the fraud (in this case, the fraud attempt), A.Duonėla was acquitted in accordance with Paragraph 300 (1) of the Criminal Code, without proving that he participated in a criminal offense”, says the verdict of the Vilnius District Court.
The firefighters saved cats buried in the ground - miaowing was heard for three days
Kaunas District Fire and Rescue Department, a report was received that a cat was miaowing for three days buried after the change of the thermal pipelines.
The firefighters arrived and also heard the cat miaowing.
It was discovered that thermal route repairs were carried out there few days ago.
It is believed that two cats could have been buried in the ground when burying the route under the span.
The firefighters excavated the span of the thermal route that was one and a half meter deep, and made a cavity for the cats to get out.
Antonin Scalia 'wouldn't be terribly surprised' by 'Mad Libs protesting' on Kavanaugh, son says
The son of late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father wouldn't have been shocked by the partisan conflagration surrounding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, owing to what he called the improperly outsized power of the Supreme Court in modern life.
"On a general level, he wouldn't be terribly surprised about the intensity surrounding this Supreme Court nomination, because so much of it comes down to Roe v. Wade -- at least, that's how the left is presenting it," Christopher Scalia said, referring to the landmark 1973 case holding that women have a constitutional right to an abortion within certain trimesters.
In one fell swoop, Roe effectively prevented states from deciding on their own how to regulate abortion, and several states immediately took steps to try to restrict abortion rights in response.
"My father often said, with Roe v. Wade in particular but other cases as well, the court was really trying to come in and settle a cultural issue that should have been resolved in elections, and the legislative process," he added during his appearance on "Fox & Friends."
"By trying to short-circuit that process, the Supreme Court caused more damage and, as a result, Supreme Court nominations and confirmation battles have become more heated, because justices have taken on the role that properly belongs to legislators."
Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse made a similar point during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings earlier this month, when he reiterated that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies and improperly leaves the resulting bureaucratic uncertainties to the Supreme Court to resolve -- effectively making the justices supplemental legislators doing a job abdicated by senators.
Hundreds of protesters were arrested and charged by Capitol Hill police for improperly interfering with those confirmation proceedings.
Asked whether Kavanaugh had any chance of avoiding that kind of backlash -- which now centers primarily on uncorroborated allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct decades ago -- Scalia said there was likely no avoiding the uproar.
Responding to claims that Kavanaugh shouldn't serve on the Supreme Court because of his fiery and, at times, defiant behavior during questioning about the lurid allegations against him by senators on Thursday, Scalia suggested justices don't always have calm temperaments.
"It's really not all that rare for justices to get angry," Scalia said, referencing sometimes-heated dissents in hot-button cases.
"It's true that judge Kavanaugh was perhaps more aggressive, but that's because the circumstances were a lot different.
He was defending his good name from uncorroborated accusations."
Kavanaugh on Thursday received the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by a party-line 11-10 vote, to advance to a full Senate floor vote.
In a dramatic moment, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he would provide his crucial swing vote in favor of Kavanaugh only if the FBI were given a one-week period in which to investigate current and credible misconduct claims against Kavanaugh.
That investigation is ongoing, and President Trump has said the agency has broad authority in the probe to interview "whoever" it wants.
Fantastical frocks rule in off-the-peg Schiaparelli range
Can you make surrealism real?
That is the question for the house of Schiaparelli.
The Paris couture house founded by Elsa Schiaparelli almost a century ago has launched its first collection of ready-to-wear clothes and handbags.
For a label that has always celebrated the fantastical rather than the wearable, it is a concept almost as far fetched as Elsa Schiaparelli's famous hat in the shape of an upturned shoe.
Yet despite its long history of eccentricity, there is something very modern about this fashion house.
The aesthetic is emoji-like, all lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli designed the first jumpsuit, in 1930, and was the first designer to set a catwalk show to music.
It was Schiaparelli and her friend Salvador Dalí who invented the art-fashion collaboration, as currently espoused at Calvin Klein and Raf Simons with US artist Sterling Ruby.
Legend has it that Dali wanted the lobster-embroidered evening gown he and Schiaparelli created to be displayed in the salon with a dressing of real mayonnaise, but he was overruled.

"We wanted to revisit this idea of collaboration, which is such a part of Schiaparelli history" said Bertrand Guyon, creative director for the past three years, speaking at the house's salon in Place Vendôme.
For the ready-to-wear collection, he took as a starting point Schiaparelli's friendship with Man Ray and created clothes based on iconic artworks, in partnership with the Man Ray Foundation.
Glass Tears, the artist's famous close up of a pair of eyes, appears on a white T-shirt studded with Perspex teardrops, while the floating red lips from Observatory Time: The Lovers appear on a collaged, silk-screen shift dress.
Man Ray's Glass Tears appears on a T-shirt from the collection.
One of Elsa's quirks was a superstitious devotion to the letter S. Shocking pink, her signature colour, inspired her perfume, Shocking.
The first Schiaparelli handbag, designed by Guyon with a keyhole design on the clasp, is called Secret.
It will retail at the fantastical price of £5,000.
The surreal side of Paris fashion week was also on display yesterday at a pop-up shop in a warehouse on the left bank of the Seine, selling €100 rugs from Virgil Abloh's soon-to-be released collection for Ikea.
Half an hour before the opening time, a 500-strong queue of Abloh's young fans stretched along the quai, excited by the prospect of buying one of his designs without the price tags that come with his Louis Vuitton menswear.
For Abloh, the project keeps communication channels open with a broader audience than can afford luxury fashion or designer furniture.
"No one owns anything any more, but if you have knowledge of a certain chair, then it is part of your dinner conversation.
That is the millennials" train of thought," he said recently.
By the time models began zooming past the audience on skateboards in a garage in the Marais, it was clear that this was not a day for ordinary catwalk shows.
Andreas Kronthaler, Vivienne Westwood's husband and a designer in his own right, took Jessica Fulford-Dobson's portraits of female skateboarders in Kabul as a starting point for a collection that saw men and women in colourful loose robes.
Some women - and a few men - skated in heeled mule sandals, although those in vertiginous platform boots stayed on foot.
Westwood, who watched from the front row in a horse-print dress from the collection and an orange cardigan tied around her waist, joined her husband on the catwalk for his final bow, where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers.
The powerful connections of twins - in pictures
Detroit-born, London-based photographer Peter Zelewski built a career in street photography before turning his attention to twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and as a human being, I've always been fascinated by twins, by that incredible bond we hear about," he says.
It was never intended as a full project, but "once I took my portrait of the first set of twins it was a massive addiction and there was no going back."
Zelewski's forthcoming book, Twins, features the images and stories of 44 sets of identical twins.
The project is primarily a visual one, he says: "It's not a documentary or scientific project - my main goal was to make powerful, emotive portraits of people."
Nurses pass vote of no confidence in union over pay deal handling
Royal College of Nursing members angry with their union's handling of changes to the NHS pay deal have voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the organisation in a unprecedented move amid accusations it had misrepresented expected pay increases.
It came after a protracted saga within the RCN after its former general secretary Janet Davies admitted it had wrongly told members they would all be in line for an immediate 3% pay increase this year following the end of the 1% pay cap.
Members were frustrated after many did not receive expected rises in pay, forcing Davies to step down amid pressure from members, which led to the no-confidence vote in the college's council at an emergency general meeting in Birmingham on Friday following a petition.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has cleared the air and the college will emerge stronger as a result," the RCN chair, Maria Trewern, said.
"This vote is clear and the council and management of the RCN have received the message.
Council has already driven change within the organisation in recent weeks - to listen more closely to members and involve them thoroughly - and this will continue."
A meeting will take place next week and it is expected that members of the RCN council will step down.
"Nursing is based on trust," an NHS nurse told the Guardian.
"The actions of the RCN council have destroyed the trust that we had in them and they must go.
I hope they will do the honourable thing and comply with request.
I await with interest to see if the members of other unions seek the same redress."
Rachel Harrison, the GMB national officer for the NHS, told the Guardian in August: "Up and down the country, NHS staff have opened their pay cheques and realised it's not the pay rise they thought they were going to get.
And they are angry."
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the RCN conceded that it made a number of mistakes in its processes around the 2018 pay deal and its communication.
However, it stated that the RCN's "Scrap the Cap" campaign forced the government to end the pay cap with a phased pay rise worth 6.5% now set to be introduced over three years.
The vote came after an independent report found that the RCN's presentation of the deal was biased towards its acceptance, while Davies was accused of "closing down" scrutiny of the deal.
It is claimed that the RCN presented "factually incorrect" information, meaning that members were not able to make an informed judgment on the deal, while alternative options were not explored.
The RCN published contradictory information on whether the 3% rise would apply for all members.
In a separate briefing before the RCN's congress, representatives were incorrectly told there would be a "3% increase, plus an increase from incremental reform."
In fact, the 3% increase included the incremental rises and, in any case, only certain workers at the top of their pay band would receive that rise immediately.
"The majority of information conveyed to members about the implementation of the deal after congress was inaccurate (probably a result of an attempt to simplify the message)," a spokesperson from the Electoral Reform Services, who conducted the report, said.
"ERS believes that failure to inform decision makers of information that compared the current system with the proposed deal in a clear succinct manner, hindered informed balanced judgment as it failed to provide clear context to the headline gains, including the 6.5% and 29% figures used in during the campaign."
The motion of no confidence passed with 78% in favour on a turnout of 3.74% of RCN members.
Lindsay Lohan disturbs Instagram Live viewers as she tries to 'kidnap' family's children on the street
Lindsay Lohan is facing criticism after posting a live video on Instagram in which she follows a homeless family down the street, trying to separate the sons from their parents.
Possibly shot in Moscow (based on previous Instagram Story updates from Lohan) the Live video starts with the actor offering to put a roof over the family's head for the night, but the situation soon becomes fraught.
"Hey everyone, I just want to show you a family that I met," she tells viewers, "a Syrian refugee family that I'm really worried about.
They really need help.
You want to come with me?
Come with me, I'll take care of you guys," she says to the family, before turning to one of the children: "Do you want to stay in a hotel tonight?
Do you want to watch movies?
It would be so cool to watch a movie on a TV or a computer."
When the parents refuse, Lohan becomes confrontational.
"You should not have them your sons on the floor, you should be a hard-working woman and you should be doing what you can for your children, so they have a better life," she says.
"If someone is offering them a home and a bed, which is me at the moment, give it to them.
They will come back to you.
I won't leave until I take you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't f*** with me."
When the family attempt to evade Lohan by walking off down the street, she follows them, still broadcasting on Instagram Live.
"Look what's happening, they're trafficking children. You're ruining Arabic culture by doing this."
"You're taking these children, they want to go.
I'm with you boys, don't worry, the whole world is seeing this right now."
The situation gets physical towards the end of the video, with the mother appearing to strike Lohan.
Clips from the video have begun circulating on social media, with several users suggesting that the incident amounts to an attempted kidnapping.
The Independent has contacted a representative for Lohan for comment.
Third of Britons believe they will never clear their debts
Almost a third of British people believe they will never clear their debts in their lifetimes and more than one in 10 say they won't even be able to reduce their debt levels.
Research by Equifax and Gorkana, seen exclusively by The Independent, reveals that people aged between 18 and 24, in particular, believe they face a lifetime of debt, with just half saying they expect to ever be able get back into the black.
Students graduate with an average debt of £46,000, according to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report out last year, and students from the poorest backgrounds graduate with debts of more than £57,000.
In fact, the vast majority of graduates - 81 per cent - will never clear their debt in full, which means they'll spend the first 30 years of their working lives with a debt hanging over them.
Debt levels across society are rising; figures from the Office for National Statistics show that household debt in the UK is at a record high, with Britons spending an average of £900 more than they earn each year.
But just how worried should we be about this flurry of depression-inducing stats?
Is a lifelong relationship with debt simply the new normal - not just for younger adults, but for the entire population?
Take cars, for example - often the biggest purchase we'll make after buying (if we're lucky) a home.
This week, Auto Trader predicted that within a decade all new cars will be bought on finance as the way we expect to pay for our motoring changes.
Jeannie Boyle, director and chartered financial planner at EQ Investors, certainly believes there has been a shift in expectation.
"Debt is definitely more normal now - credit cards are more prevalent, and so are zero per cent balance transfers, student loans and pay day lenders," she says.
"For our grandparents' generation it was shameful to be in debt."
In recent times, student debt and house prices have normalised debt.
Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, agrees and says the result could be worrying.
"If you're having to borrow four to five times your income to buy a property, an enormous sum in itself, adding some more debt to that may not seem like such a big deal," she explains.
And that is where people are going to get into trouble.
Interest rates have been very low for many years and people with big mortgages or other debts should be aware that they need to factor in a cushion for when rates rise.
Perhaps understandably, commentators from the finance industry seem confident.
Brian Brodie, chief executive of the loans agency Freedom Finance, says: "Debt isn't a dirty word."
Whether financing home improvements or purchasing a new car, taking out a loan is no longer seen as the "last resort."
Low interest rates have driven many people to lock their savings away in fixed-term accounts that offer higher returns, but reduced access to savings.
As a result, "middle class" borrowing is on the rise.
In the last six months, around half of our new loans were taken out by customers with an "excellent" credit rating.
For Richard Haymes, head of financial difficulties at Equifax company TDX Group, this expectation of a lifetime of debt is a clear concern.
He says: "With inflation hitting a six-month high in August (2.7 per cent), a recent interest rate rise and limited wage growth, it's disconcerting that a large proportion of people are taking on debt without a realistic expectation of being able to pay it back."
According to our analysis, personal insolvencies are set to grow by 17 per cent this year, and the main contributing factor is record levels of consumer borrowing.
Debt might be manageable while people work and earn but there's concern about what a lifetime in debt might mean for our old-age wellbeing.
Research carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with equity release specialist More 2 Life shows that unsecured debt among 55- to 74-year-olds has risen by more than a third over the last four years, more than twice as fast as the national average.
And the most common form of debt for this age group is credit cards, with 30 per cent spending more than they pay off each month.
Boyle adds: "We're increasingly seeing people using pension freedoms to pay off debt when they turn 55, which has an impact on their wellbeing in retirement.
This is often the only savings they've effectively been "forced" to make.
People also think they will use equity in their property to pay it off later - but this is problematic as downsizing does not always release as much money as expected.
Any future drop in property process will exacerbate this.
Serena Williams sings 'I Touch Myself' topless to raise breast cancer awareness
Serena Williams has released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" while covering her bare chest with her hands.
The tennis pro shared the clip on her Instagram page, explaining that she created the video to encourage women to self-check their breasts.
"This Breast Cancer Awareness Month I've recorded a version of The Divinyls global hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to self-check regularly," Williams wrote.
"Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it's an issue that affects all women of all colours, all around the world.
Early detection is key - it saves so many lives.
I just hope this helps to remind women of that."
Williams continued: "The music video is part of the "I Touch Myself Project" which was created in honour of celebrated diva, Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer, and who gave us her hit song to remind women to put their health first."
The project, which is supported by lingerie brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), first launched in 2014 following the passing of Amphlett at the age of 53.
Since posting the video on her Instagram account, it has been viewed more than 1.5 million times with legions of fans praising the tennis superstar for performing the song.
"So much love for this and what you did, putting yourself out there.
Thank you Serena," one person wrote.
Another added: "I LOVE this, Serena.
I'm a breast cancer survivor of 20 years and I found the lump myself on self-exam even after mammograms showed nothing.
Exams are so so important.
Thank you for putting yourself out of your comfort zone - you are a goddess!"
As part of the "I Touch Myself Project," Berlei is also releasing a new snakeskin print, rock star inspired bra called The Chrissy.
100 per cent of the profits from the bra will be donated to BCNA.
When self-checking, it is important to know the signs and symptoms you should be looking for.
As well as lumps, other signs of breast cancer include a change in breast size or shape, a rash or skin sores, nipple discharge, skin indentation, constant pain or a change in skin texture.
Similarly, swelling around the armpit or collarbone could be an indicator, as can a growing vein or inverted nipple.
Women are advised to check their breasts each month.
If you notice any symptoms of breast cancer, the NHS advises that you see your GP as soon as possible.
After examination, your GP will then refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic if they feel your symptoms need further assessment.
Adam Driver is so good in this SNL skit that the cast can't keep a straight face
Adam Driver was the guest host of Saturday Night Live this week, and he really gave 110%.
The show's funniest sketches always tend to be the ones that aren't pegged to a specific current event, and so was the case with new skit "Career Day."
It centres on a "bring your father to work" day at an American high school, where teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees to let his elderly oil baron father, Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), give a talk.
Hobbling in on a cane, Parnassus proceeds to deliver a blistering account of his domination of the oil industry, a megalomaniac likely inspired in part by the Daniel Day-Lewis "There Will Be Blood" character Daniel Plainview.
"I was born seven months too early," Parnassus tells the students.
"Incubation technology was still in its infancy, so they placed me in a cast iron pot inside a pizza oven until I was ripe enough to walk.
My bones never hardened but my spirit did.
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson, along with fellow SNL cast member Aidy Bryant who plays the schoolteacher, struggle to keep straight faces and are largely unable to look Driver in the eye.
The Star Wars actor is in full force however, growing increasingly belligerent as he recalls his personal war with oil baron rival HR Pickins.
"I married your granddaughter!" he spits.
"Filled her belly with my festering seed and soiled your boy, he is my final revenge HR!"
In under five minutes, Parnassus became as enthralling an Adam Driver character as Kylo Ren did in two feature films.
"Curse you, HR!"
Kendrick Lamar leak: Eight unheard songs surface online
Kendrick Lamar appears to have been the victim of a sizeable leak of unreleased songs.
Eight never-before-heard tracks hit the internet overnight on Saturday, featuring guest verses from SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul.
It is unclear where they stem from, and neither the nickname the collection is being circulated under, "Bad Kid Chill City EP," nor the artwork (which seems to have been created by a fan) are official.
The tracks, which may be demos and only half-finished, sound as though they were recorded during different parts of Lamar's career.
"Gang Member" would seem to be of Good Kid Maad City era, while "Heroin" featuring SZA sounds closer to DAMN./Black Panther soundtrack.
The tracks being passed around as a collection are as follows:
Gang Member
The Only Nigga
Want In Life
Loved Ones (featuring SZA)
Own This City
Heroin (featuring SZA, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad, & Ab Soul
Look Over Your Shoulders (featuring Busta Rhymes & Michael Jackson)
Swimming Pools Alternate
The Independent has contacted a representative for Kendrick Lamar for comment.
Turmoil for the musical “Chicago”: after no tickets are left in Klaipėda, people are invited to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
The desire of Lithuanians to see the musical of the Klaipėda State Musical Theater "Chicago" does not subside.
Because of this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musical of all times is set to go on one more tour to the country’s largest arenas.
However, with roughly 1.5 month left to the shows, there is a lack of seats in the arenas.
The organizers announce that they have already sold all tickets to the musical in "Švyturys" arena in Klaipėda, and that the tickets to “Žalgiris” arena in Kaunas and “Siemens” arena in Vilnius are quickly disappearing.
There are no more tickets in the port city, so everyone who wants to see the musical that does not leave anyone indifferent is invited to visit Kaunas or Vilnius where there are still some tickets left.
The shows will take place in December, so those who will come from further, will not only see our musical, but also will have a great opportunity to see Christmas trees in the largest cities of the country", said Laima Vilimienė, head of Klaipėda State Theater, offering a solution to the fans of the musical.
The cast of “Chicago” will be a little different in December.
One of the main roles of the musical was entrusted to the actor Tomas Žaibas for the first time.
In “Chicago”, the talented actor, who is well known from TV screens, will impersonate an inimitable Billy Flynn, the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, who is changing fates of people without any scruples.
Since the Klaipėda State Musical Theater’s musical “Chicago” has been adapted for larger spaces, arenas, the cast is also larger than in the Broadway show.
The Lithuanian “Chicago” cast consists of almost fifty artists.
The main roles of women are entrusted to the spectacular soloist of Klaipėda State Musical Theater Beata Ignatavičiūtė (killer Velma Kelly) and Gabriele Bielskytė (killer Roxie Hart), the charismatic soloist of the Kaunas Musical Theater.
The “Chicago” musical depicts the Chicago criminal world of the 1920s, which turns the walls of the prison into a place where the stars are born.
It's a musical satire of criminal justice, telling about two killers who seek attention and recognition.
The musical is full of sexuality and irony.
It does not matter where the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - are or what they do, the meaning of their life is to shine like a star.
Their life is living for a message on the first page, for a headline, the glitter, the alley of glory...
On December 13 “Chicago” will be shown in “Švyturys” Arena in Klaipėda, on December 18 - in ”Žalgiris” arena in Kaunas, on December 20 - in ”Siemens” arena in Vilnius.
Tickets are distributed by ”Tiketa”.
Living room furniture in Kaunas
The living room can be called a representative home zone, where we spend time with friends, invite guests, and so on. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or the house, but also for the guests.
The furniture should be selected depending on the size of the living room, the walls, ceiling decor, taste of the owners.
The living room should be not only beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to hire an interior designer, who will help to fill the space optimally, so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advisable to first choose the main point of the living room, i.e. the item with which you will combine furniture, other details.
It can be a fireplace or other important accent of the living room.
It would also be great to create a space for chatting in the living room, where guests could communicate comfortably without being interfered by the furniture and similar items.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests could sit down and chat.
So the layout of the furniture should encourage communication, unite people, rather than distance them from each other.
Do not push the furniture to the wall.
The distance from the walls depends on the size of the room.
Even if the room is small, leave at least some space away from the wall, do not push the furniture up to it.
If the room is spacious, leave even more space from the walls.
In fact, the bigger the distance the better.
Create balance while arranging the furniture
Consider the size and location of various details that will be in your living room.
All elements must match with each other.
The furniture of the living room must be in line with the interior details.
A little contrast is possible.
It will brighten up the interior of the living room, but it should not be too big, as the interior will become tacky.
We advise you to always consult with interior designers.
When creating the interior for the living room yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk to go to the extremes: either you will create a boring interior because you will be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, choose wrongly, or you will overdo while improvising.
Proper lighting
This is a very important thing.
After all, different light reveals space in different ways.
The lighting must be arranged at various levels: ceiling chandeliers, wall lamps, floor lamps.
The Prosecutor's Office appealed the acquittal of the LBF leaders
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office appealed against the verdict of the Vilnius District Court to the former leaders of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LBF).
As the Prosecutor's Office reported on Monday, the complaint states that Panevėžys City Municipality had no legal basis to contribute with the municipal budget monetary funds to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys.
During the preliminary investigation, it was determined that in order to find the opportunity to finance reconstruction of the hotel, a contract for purchase and sale of public services was concluded between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality in 2010.
Prosecutors say that the services, which federation was supposed to provide to Panevėžys City Municipality in accordance with the said agreement, were not intended to and could not be provided, since the funding from the state and sponsors was already received or intended to be provided to the planned services, and a part of the planned events had already taken place before the contract was signed and already paid from other funds, and some of the events have already taken place after VAT invoicing - money according with the invoices have been transferred for the events that have not yet taken place.
Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office argues that it disagrees with the conclusion of the court of the first instance that the State itself has instructed Panevėžys City Municipality to start reconstruction of the private hotel, because there was no state obligation for a particular hotel, there was only an offer to Panevėžys City Municipality to solve the development issues of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the Prosecutor's Office, the court unreasonably stated that the heads of the LBF and Panevėžys City Municipality attempted to fulfill the state obligation without having legitimate ways, since the data in the case showed that there was a possibility to organize European Basketball Championship group matches in other cities, without violating the law.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office appeal for the annulment of the exculpatory verdict of the first instance court and adoption of a new judgment - a conviction - in this case for seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, Vilnius District Court fully acquitted LBF General Secretary Mindaugas Balčiūnas for all alleged crimes.
This case concerns the preparation for the European Men's Basketball Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
M. Balčiūnas was accused of abuse of power, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor's Office accused M.Balčiūnas that while he was a General Secretary of LBF, he agreed with the Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Director of the Federation to prepare on behalf of the Federation work delivery and acceptance certificates that were not in line with reality as well as other false financial documents and accounts for alleged services that LBF provided to Panevėžys City Municipality that were entered into official accounts.
According to the data of the preliminary investigation conducted by the officials of Panevėžys Board of the Special Investigation Service (SIS), the funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could have been overtaken by fraud and using false documents for the benefit of the LBF and later used by the company “Via Unica” for the reconstruction of the hotel “Romantic”.
The head of this hotel, Dalia Kuklierienė, was accused of bribing - it is suspected that she gave a television set as a bribe to M.Balčiūnas.
Everyone who has been convicted with M.Balčiūnas have been acquitted.
The accusations in this case were filed against eight natural persons and one legal entity, the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace is compared to the Bermuda Triangle
Since 1992, the number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania has already exceeded the total population of Alytus city and amounts to about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a particular physical workplace and its safety are clear, then the choice to work remotely - from home, public space or even other countries - is becoming a new Bermuda Triangle.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Occupational Safety and Health sets out safety and health conditions for remotely working employees that are not different from the conditions of other employees of the company, the variety of modern forms of work may raise a number of issues, says the press release.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer pays a compensation which is 80% of the salary for the first two days of unemployment, and for the remainder of the period it is paid by “Sodra”.
If it is determined that the accident happened during work, then “Sodra” compensates 100% of the salary from the first day of sick leave.
When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labor Inspectorate and damages administered by BTA, it is obvious that the absolute majority of occupational accidents and various injuries occur at workplace.
Most often it is various physical work, where the risk of injury is higher: careless handling of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, the offices with the most marketable and best paid specialists face their own challenges, which are caused by the freedom of mobility provided by the employer that employees are very fond of”, says Jevgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of Human Resources Management Department of BTA.
Legislation that is in force in Lithuania recommends clearly regulating the duties and responsibilities of an employee, defining working time, place and functions, and this also applies to the remote working.
If this is done, it's easier to determine whether an accident occurred during working time, or not.
There are different situations and nuances, and each case is considered individually.
Employees often hear that, for example, the employer is responsible for the accidents that occur on the way to or from work, or while travelling to work meetings.
However, there are plenty of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate talks, to be as clear as possible, and to find out for the benefit of both sides, what situations are actually treated as accidents at work and which will fall under the status of domestic traumas”, advises the specialist.
J. Krikščiūnė argues that in these days, when work functions can be performed with a computer, a mobile phone and a stable Internet connection, an employee will not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the specified time.
Employees are mobile, and instead of home they can choose to work while drinking coffee at a cafe or in a park while enjoying the sun.
Will it be a workplace or not?
And if the discussed working hours do not match the ones provided in the agreement?
There may be really ambiguous situations, the circumstances of which are clarified by the investigation initiated by “Sodra” or the State Labor Inspectorate”, says the specialist.
According to her, from the financial point of view, the main difference between an incident at work and at home is the amount of sickness benefit.
J. Krikščiūnė acknowledges that she had unofficially heard unpleasant experiences when employers try to conceal the real circumstances of accidents or traumas and try to persuade employees to seek medical help outside the working hours, to assume responsibility for themselves, thereby, to suffer financially.
This is a dishonest, disrespectful attitude towards the employee, and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the already mentioned mobility of people encourages to search for additional tools that can help companies in similar situations: it also includes employer’s civil liability insurance for damage to employees, accident insurance against trauma, acquiring insurance for disability or even death, and health insurance is also important”, says J.Krikščiūnė.
Mobile signature system is functioning again
After removing a failure on Monday, the mobile signature system is functioning again in Lithuania, confirmed the representatives of the service provider Estonian IT company “SK ID Solutions” to BNS.
The company reported about the disruptions on Monday morning, it affected the customers of “Bitė”, “Telia” and a part of “Tele2” users.
Disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but representatives of “SK ID Solutions” were not able to comment on the situation in that country.
Polish lessons to the Lithuanian rugby team
The Lithuanian rugby team, which has made its debut in the European “Trophy” division, is still struggling to keep up with its stronger rivals.
In terms of capacity, the “Trophy” division is the third strongest division in the old continent after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
It includes 13 to 18 ranked continental teams.
Lithuanians started the match in October with a steady victory in Šiauliai 30:10 against the Czech team.
Last weekend Lithuanian team went to Lodz, where they could not keep up with the Polish team - 0:33 (0:12).
Though the Lithuanians defended themselves selflessly, they often violated the rules, and the Polish rugby players advanced due to penalty strikes.
At 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes, penalty strikes were made by Wojciech Piotrowicz, who delivered 12 point advantage to his teammates.
In the first half, Lithuanians had to play 10 minutes without Tautvydas Mažylis, who received a yellow card.
During the second half of the game, the guests made several attacks, but they completed them without results.
At that time, the Poles managed to break our defense.
Mateusz Plichta, and afterwards Krystian Pogorzelski and Mateusz Adamski, scored in the playing field.
The coach of the Lithuanian national team, which played without several important rugby players, Ntando Manyosha from SAR, recognized the rivals’ advantage and said that such match provided a very valuable experience.
“The Poles played very well and dominated all the components of the game.
Our goal was to withstand this match for as long as possible.
We have just moved to this higher level and have to settle in it.
We won the first match against the Czechs, but then we met with very powerful rivals and had to admit their advantage.
The Polish team gave us useful lessons”, said a specialist from SAR, who has been standing in front of the Lithuanian national team for four years.
The next match in the “Trophy” division will be played by Lithuanians on April 6, 2019 at home with the Portuguese or the Romanians.
Dutch and Swiss teams also compete in this division.
Juozapas Blažiūnas became the advisor of the Minister of Culture
Juozapas Blažiūnas started working as an advisor to the Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson.
J. Blažiūnas will advise the Minister on archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management, the Ministry announced.
J.Blažiūnas, who acquired the Doctor of Arts degree in art studies at the Vilnius Academy of Arts, has until now been the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive, associate professor of the Department of Museology at the Faculty of Communication at Vilnius University.
According to the report, the Minister’s advisor is the author of many scientific articles on the preservation of cultural heritage and properties.
The Japanese Coast Guard is actively looking for the missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to a very small island in the north of Japan in 2014.
Small, meaningless and worthless island, which was essentially unsuitable for living, was very important to Japan.
It was so important that after its disappearance the area now is being actively explored - maybe it will still appear?
Why does Japan need this island so much?
It will not appear.
It is likely that ice and underwater landslides have taken this island forever, although not long ago it was almost two meters above the surface of the water.
There is almost no doubt that the island simply broke, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When did the island disappear, nobody knows exactly - it was so worthless that nobody really followed it.
Probably the first to find out the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima were the Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an auxiliary visual navigation tool.
Its disappearance, even for these fishermen, is not a tragedy as there are better ways to know where it is allowed to fish, and where the disputed Russian waters begin.
That is exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
This narrow strip of land was the most western edge of the Kuril Islands.
This is a chain of islands, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, while Japan calls it the Northern territories.
The conflict with some breaks lasts from the middle of the 19th century, but in the 20th century it intensified in full force.
There are natural resources in these areas, however, Japan believes that the islands should belong to it historically.
The point is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to make the map, to start a more detailed research, while registering countless small islands.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin belonged to the latter, and all the Kuril Islands - to Japan.
These two countries lived in peace until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan in the war.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and seized the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not make big claims regarding the entire archipelago, although they were there first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai.
Japan feels that it has a historic right, since they were the first ones to explore the islands, and they belonged to Japan under the agreements signed in 1855.
In 2009, Japan offered to Russia to share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider adopting such an offer.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now that the island is missing, this geographic link is lost.
The physical marker of the presence of Japan in those waters had disappeared.
This is a big loss, which is why the remains of the island are being sought.
But even after finding them, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not fit a simple definition of an island - it must be a land.
This indicates a slight decrease in the territory of Japan and a great shrink in the exclusive economic zone, calculated from the shores.
It is interesting, what the island's search mission is hoping for - it is certainly not simply lost or drifted.
Unbelievable drama in the Lithuanian-Polish boxing match
We had to wait for the final verdict of the judges for more than a week to find out who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
In Poland, nine Polish and Lithuanian matches were organized.
Lithuanians and Polish won four matches each.
The outcome of the crucial battle was a long debate of the panel of judges and the final decision of the secretariat of the match.
The meeting of the teams began with the victories of the Lithuanian boxers.
Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) defeated Jakub Surma 3:0, soon Edgaras Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after the persistent fight defeated Radomir Obrusniak 2:1.
It was followed by two victories of the hosts: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) defeated Mantas Dužinas 3:0, and Filip Wachala (up to 69 kg) excelled Saimonas Banys 2:1.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) has returned the advantage to the Lithuanian team.
The Lithuanian defeated Bartosz Golebiewski 2:1.
In the next fight, Piotr Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) defeated Eigirdas Kasmočius in the third round and the result was equal again 3:3.
The results of brothers Jokuliai were different.
Robertas Jokulys (up to 91 kg) defeated Andrzej Kolton 3:0, and Arvydas Jokulis (over 91 kg) had to acknowledge Adam Kulik's advantage already in the first round.
The biggest controversy was caused by Tadas Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski's fight.
It was the reason why it took more than a week to reach the final result of the cross-border meeting.
One judge recognized the victory of the Polish, two judges - of the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error the point of one judge that was intended for the Lithuanian was credited to Soczynski.
After the long dispute it was decided the winner was Polish boxer - 2:1.
The hosts won 10:8 in the meeting of the Lithuanian-Polish teams (2 points are awarded for the victory).
They succeeded to revenge Lithuanians for the devastating defeat they suffered during the last match.
In 2015, Lithuanian boxers won five of the six fights with a result 10:2 in the meeting that took place in Marijampolė.
The meeting of the Lithuanian team leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian Boxing Championship that will take place on November 14-17, in Šilutė.
After the country's championship, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the honor of the country at the next year's World and European Championships.
How does a dog determine the direction of human tracks?
You already know that the dog's sense of smell is extremely sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, and some can even smell diseases.
Tracker dogs that became famous in the movies are also well-known, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine, in which direction the trace owner went?
In fact, this question is much more complicated than you think.
Trace following consists of three stages: finding, determining the direction and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to decide in which direction the person has went.
After all, the time between the different steps is less than one second, so their smell is not very different, right?
Not really.
A 1990 study published by the University of Oslo describes experiments in which a dog was brought at a 90-degree angle to a human trajectory.
Tests were performed on grass and on asphalt.
And in most cases, the dogs easily identified the direction of the human, even when he tried to mislead them by going backwards.
Can you imagine how complex this task is?
The difference between the smell of adjacent traces is very small, and with time it is decreases even more.
However, scientists say it's not that strange - dogs could tell which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their sense of smell is an incredible tool.
The dog's brain is dominated by the areas responsible for the sense of smell (the way our brain is dominated by the regions responsible for the eyesight).
Noses of the dogs have 125-300 million smell receptors.
In general, dogs’ sense of smell is at least 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, but their ability to interpret different scents is even more important.
Scientists then performed similar experiments with tracks left by bicycles, but it was much more difficult for the dogs to trace their direction.
This is due to the fact that bicycle’s tracks are not segmented as human tracks, making it more difficult to isolate different locations for comparison - this is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
In fact, dogs are not the owners of the strongest sense of smell.
This title is likely to go to the bears.
The white bears' males follow females that are ready to mate hundreds of kilometers, while brown bears can smell a dead animal up to 30 km.
Deforestation is to be regulated in private forests
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navickas will talk about deforestation in the Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August, the public was dissatisfied about the deforestation at Labanoras Regional Park.
The deforestation of these forests was stopped for a month.
The Minister has acknowledged that the investigations of deforestation carried out at Labanoras showed no gross violations.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced some restrictions, taking into account the suggestion by the working group to tighten deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legal acts that will regulate deforestation will be prepared by the end of the year.
The same restrictions that are applied to deforestation in state forests are also planned to be applied in private forests.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of bringing together 170 thousand followers
You should give people what they want and at the same time give something that you want yourself, says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė on LRT television show “Kultūringai su Nomeda”.
According to the stylist, thus she gradually brought together a huge crowd of fans.
“At first you gratify a person’s taste, pull them after yourself, and in the course of time you gradually improve that taste”, states A.agelavičiūtė.
A.Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers of her Facebook account - she reached that figure using a certain strategy: “At first you gratify a person’s taste, pull them after yourself, and in the course of time you gradually improve that taste”.
Stylist A.Jagelavičiūtė claims that she cannot stand fake people, therefore shows her face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way to present oneself are the most important criteria for popularity in social networks.
She observes that the human culture is disappearing in social networks, as many Internet users go there in order to fight with someone or to read the comments of other fighting people: "For example, when I was an adolescent, there was a time when I wanted to fight with everyone and curse - now I do not want that."
"Fake life is the most horrible thing.
And there are so much of it in social networks.
On Facebook a bit less than Instagram", she says.
A.Jagelavičiūtė, who has a degree in interior design and painting, says that she sends a specific message on social networks - she talks about emancipation of women.
She also promotes the production of magazines, and sees creativity in her work.
“I cannot say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know that there is a lot of it.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, as well as vanity.
I'm balancing - that's my key to those huge numbers.
I do not want to create fake life.
It is much better to give people what they want and to give silently something that you want yourself”, says A.Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the events that do not attract young people easily are classical music concerts.
Famous people suggested to increase their popularity through real life stories: to talk about backstage, failures, life events, while remaining authentic.
It is the strategy that A.Jagelevičiūtė suggests to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, if the culture does not gratify anyone, does not entertain and shows real values, it has no opportunities.
“Like a boring lecturer in front of students - are there any chances?
If we do not find a way to present that art, you can advertise as much as you want, nothing will happen.
When we are real and get the reader - maybe then something will change.
You will get them one, two, three times - and that is already a dependence”, she shares her insights.
Three People Missing After Crash in Lituya Bay, North of Juneau
A search was underway on Saturday for three people missing after a helicopter crash north of Juneau, Alaska.
One person was rescued after the crash on Friday, but three others were unaccounted for.
The helicopter crashed near Lituya Bay, northwest of Juneau.
The helicopter was identified as an Airbus H125, on a long distance trip out of Grand Prairie, Texas.
Debris from the aircraft was found 100 feet from the shore on Friday.
The one person rescued was identified as a 14-year-old, the Associated Press reported.
The survivor was reported to have mild hypothermia but was otherwise okay.
There were two adults and two adolescents on the helicopter when it went down.
The missing were identified as David King, 53; Josh Pepperd, 42; and Andrew Pepperd, 11, according to KTVA.
The elder Pepperd was identified as the president of Alaska based construction firm Davis Constructors & Engineers.
It was not clear what caused the crash.
The National Transportation Safety Board said it an investigation was underway.
"Two adults and two adolescents were aboard the crashed helicopter that was reported to be brand new out of the factory," Coast Guard officials said in a statement, according to KTVA.
The pilot is reported to have 40 years flying experiencing including Alaska flight time in both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.
Family friend Jeff Brodsky said loved ones were "holding onto hope that a miracle will happen," according to the Anchorage Daily News.
Rescuers resume a search with help from a Coastguard helicopter for two experienced climbers missing on Ben Nevis on February 17, 2016, in Fort William, Scotland.
A search was underway on Saturday for three people missing after a helicopter crash in Alaska.
'I'm A Victim of Sexual Assault'
Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said Sunday morning that she is a victim of sexual assault.
Conway responded to the intense exchanges during the past week's testimonies from Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
In response, Conway emotionally declared she herself is a victim of sexual assault in the past and defended Kavanaugh to host Jake Tapper, saying she believes sexual assault accusations against him were "cherry-picked."
"I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.
I'm a victim of sexual assault," Conway told CNN's "State of the Union" program Sunday.
"I'm a victim of sexual assault, I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh or Take Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to be held responsible for that.
You have to be responsible for your own conduct."
Conway blasted the network as a "disgrace" for comparing the accusations made against Kavanaugh to those directed at Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in Pennsylvania state prison last week.
Conway also railed against the Senate Judiciary Committee's inability to remove former President Bill Clinton from office despite having oral sex in the Oval Office and "lying about it" directly to the American people.
Kavanaugh And Ford Testimonies Have Divided America, Poll Shows
Americas are at odds over the testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who claims the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers.
And the number of people who believed Ford or Kavanaugh were lying was similar, with 38 percent saying they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while a smaller 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both parties after Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein detailing her allegation against the judge.
When the letter was made publi,c both Ford and Kavanaugh said they would be prepared to speak before the committee.
During her testimony, Ford said she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was the person who had attempted to assault her at a house party in the early 1980s dismissing the idea that there could be a case of mistaken identity.
In an emotional opening statement the 51-year-old said she had felt it was her civic duty to come forward.
"I am terrified," she said.
"I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."
Kavanaugh, who denied the allegations made by Ford, as well as by two other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, said he had "never sexually assaulted anyone - not in high school, not in college, not ever."
"There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything - no matter how far-fetched or odious, that will block a vote of my nomination," he said.
"These are last minute smears, pure and simple."
Unsurprisingly, the results of the YouGov poll, which surveyed 2,607 people from 27-28 September were split on party lines, with Democrats far more likely to believe Ford (73 percent) and Republicans more likely to believe Kavanaugh (74 percent,) although more Republicans believed Ford than Democrats did Kavanaugh (14 percent compared with 11 percent.)
Body Worlds Founder, Known As "Dr Death," Wants To Be Cut Up And Put In His Own Show
The German scientist who invented plastination wants to be a permanent part of his Body Worlds exhibition after he dies.
Gunther von Hagens came up with the pioneering technique, which allowed the display of cadavers, skulls and organs in exhibitions that have gone around the world and sparked amazement as well as controversy.
Now terminally ill with cancer, the 73-year-old has instructed his wife to plastinate him after his death so that he become a permanent fixture in the Body Worlds exhibition which opens to the public this week in London.
It's somehow finalising his life's work.
I understand now that it's more an appreciation and an expression of love for me to do it," Angelina Whalley told The Observer.
She said that her husband has issued strict instructions on what to do with his corpse in a process that takes about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries need to be unwound, the body will be injected with silicone and then put in a pose.
"He said to me: "Angelina, you are entitled to freeze me down to -25 Celsius for one year, but after that time you really need to put your hands on me because otherwise I will get freeze burn.""
So I have one year for mourning and then I will have to do it."
Then, ideally wearing his trademark fedora hat, he will join the exhibition in the London Pavilion, with other bodies frozen in time and erected in poses like riding a horse or playing cards.
Von Hagens rose to fame in the UK when he performed a live autopsy on British television, the first public autopsy for 170 years.
More than 47 million people have visited versions of Body Worlds around the world since 1995.
Founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernal, told The Guardian that the 28,000 square foot exhibition space was based on 100% donations from people who "have given consent in order to help and educate the living, to help people see what can go wrong.
We see and read so many horrible things that it makes us scared of death.
We are all going there, that's what we have in common, we are all going to die and I think Body Worlds shows us that you don't have to be afraid," Tabernal said.
Ronaldo's Lawyers Threaten Lawsuit Over Rape Accusation
Lawyers for the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said Friday that they would sue a German magazine after it had published what they called "blatantly illegal" accusations by an American woman who says she was raped by Ronaldo in 2009.
One of Ronaldo's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the report in the magazine, Der Spiegel, was "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy" and that he would seek legal redress for his client from the magazine.
The statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo's agent, the firm Gestifute, in response to a request for comment on Der Spiegel's article, which was published online Friday.
Gestifute did not answer any specific questions about the content of Der Spiegel's report, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.
Der Spiegel first reported on the allegation in April 2017.
Ronaldo, one of the biggest names in world sports, is a five-time world player of the year.
He transferred to Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid this summer; the Italian club declined to comment on Der Spiegel's report.
The magazine said the suspected rape took place in June 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas, according to Leslie Mark Stovall, the lawyer for the woman who made the accusation, Kathryn Mayorga.
Ronaldo and Mayorga then reached an out-of-court settlement, according to Stovall and the magazine.
In it, Mayorga agreed to a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a $375,000 payment from Ronaldo.
Stovall did not immediately respond to email requests from Reuters for comment on the article, and Mayorga did not answer telephone calls to her home.
Stovall told Der Spiegel, however, that he had filed a civil complaint seeking to declare the nondisclosure agreement void.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel she no longer felt bound by the agreement as she suffers from the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I've had like these serious breakdowns," she told Der Spiegel.
"And again, blaming of the rape.
And I blame him, and I blame myself for signing that thing."
Independence Through Sustainable Author Businesses
Are you ready for self-publishing 3.0?
In a new white paper released today on #selfpub3.0, the Alliance of Independent Authors details how, for the first time, authors can now join the ranks of other creative entrepreneurs in growing their independence and building sustainable author businesses.
Orna Ross, founder of the Alliance of Independent Authors and repeatedly named "One of the 100 Most Influential People in Publishing," will explain why and how authors should embrace self-publishing 3.0 at Digital Book World 2018.
"Consumer trends like the rise of personal branding, mindful consumption and mobile phone reading are combining with digital publishing tech to create more favorable conditions than ever before for author-businesses," says Ross.
But only authors who have developed an independent, creative and empowered mindset, who understand the value of their intellectual property, can benefit from these opportunities.
#selfpub3.0 encourages authors to ensure we have a diversity of earning streams through our own websites, which become the hub of our successful publishing and media enterprises.
Income streams might include direct sales, subscription models, crowdsourced patronage, wide distribution models and other income streams like online teaching and affiliate income.
#selfpub3.0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books as widely as possible, in as many formats as possible.
Mostly, #selfpub3.0 is about the shift in mindset needed to take control of your author business rather than unthinkingly assigning all your intellectual property, your most valuable creative asset, to a business owned by another, whether that is a trade-publisher or self-publishing service.
These are the steps that maximize income, impact, and influence for authors and should be of interest to every author and publisher working in the digital age, Ross says, pointing out that true independence, for authors as for anyone, must be rooted in commercial as well as creative independence.
This is the future, now.
And it has never been so bright for independent authors.
Self-Publishing 1.0 was desktop publishing and print on demand.
Self-Publishing 2.0 was selling e-books for e-readers and phones via online bookstores.
Now we're entering the era of self-publishing 3.0: self-publishers building viable and sustainable author enterprises.
The Alliance of Independent Authors is the only global, non-profit association for self-publishing writers.
ALLi aims to foster excellence and ethics in self-publishing; to support authors in the making and selling of their books; and to advocate for author independence through the building of sustainable digital businesses.
Italy president, central banker warn government over deficit plan
Italy's president and its central bank governor on Saturday warned that the country's debt must remain sustainable after the populist government unveiled plans to significantly raise deficit spending next year.
Late on Thursday, the ruling parties - made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - proposed a 2019 deficit that is, at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), three times the previous administration's target.
The announcement rattled markets on Friday, prompting a sell-off of bonds and a rout of banking stocks.
It also set up a clash with the European Commission, which monitors and enforces EU fiscal rules.
President Sergio Mattarella, addressing a group at the presidential palace that had marked the 70th anniversary of the constitution, noted that the state's founding law requires "balanced budgets and the sustainability of debt."
"This is to protect the savings of our fellow citizens," he said.
A little later at a conference in central Italy, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said the country's debt, the largest among big European Union economies at 131 percent of GDP, must not be allowed to increase.
"Italy needs to favor public and private investment and to contain and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to Ansa state news agency.
"The debt must be "put on downward path," he added.
Matteo Salvini, leader of the League and also a deputy prime minister, responded to Mattarella by saying that years of Brussels-imposed austerity had driven up debt.
"Be calm Mr. President," Salvini said in a statement.
"Years of budgets imposed by Europe have made our public debt explode. Finally we are changing course and betting on the future and on growth."
Earlier, before either Mattarella or Visco spoke, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the budget would "repay the people for the thieving of the past," though he added the government's intention was not to challenge the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pushed Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is an economist unaffiliated with either group, to sign off on their plans to hike deficit spending.
Italian media said Mattarella had supported Tria's failed effort to keep the deficit target below 2 percent of GDP.
The president and the central banker have no direct role in making economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject a law and send it back to parliament, but he can do so only once.
Parliament can then pass it again, unchanged, and he must sign it into law.
Indonesia tsunami sensors missed huge waves: official
Indonesia's geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning 34 minutes after it was first issued following a major earthquake that sent huge waves crashing into the northeastern coast of Sulawesi island, killing hundreds and leaving thousands more homeless.
The ruins of cars as seen after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.
The 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami, which hit the city of Palu about 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta and further along the coastline, killed at least 384 people.
Officials said on Saturday the death toll was likely to rise.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their death.
The geophysics agency (BMKG) faced criticism on Saturday on social media, with many questioning if the tsunami warning was lifted too soon.
The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to "end" the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
"We have no observation data at Palu.
So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that," said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami center at BMKG.
He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in sea level, only recorded an "insignificant," six-centimeter (2.5 inches) wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu.
"If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better.
This is something we must evaluate for the future," said Triyono.
It was not clear whether the tsunami, which officials say hammered Palu and the surrounding area at extremely high speeds measuring in the hundreds of kilometers per hour, occurred before or after the warning had been lifted.
Resident checks dead bodies to find their family at a street after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.
"Based on the videos circulating on social media, we estimate the tsunami happened before the warning officially ended," Triyono said.
The most devastating came on Boxing Day in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including over 126,000 in Indonesia.
The scenic town of Palu sits at the mouth of a narrow bay in northeastern Sulawesi and is home to around 380,000 people.
It was hit by a tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB).
Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at University of Oxford, said it was "surprising" the quake had generated a tsunami.
Friday's quake was recorded as a "strike-slip" event where neighboring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami.
"There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami," he said, adding the narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster agency, told reporters his team had been "preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand" when the tsunami warning was "suddenly ended."
The communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Nugroho said the quake had brought down the area's power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast.
Indonesians took to social media to question the BMKG's move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner.
"So upset.. the warning was lifted.. although a tsunami happened..." said one Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: 'Mollywood' duo on course to smash box office records
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood won their foursomes on Saturday to become the first European duo to sweep all four pairs matches and are on course for even more history as Europe take a 10-6 lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
After thumping Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau 5&4 they became the first-ever European pairing to win all four of their matches.
Only Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins, in 1979, have ever managed it for the Americans.
The crushing winning margins - 3&1, 5&4, 4&3 and 5&4 - tell only half the story.
Left in their dust was a battered Woods, the 14-times major winner being drubbed three times, with Patrick Reed brushed aside twice.
The other win came against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the form pairing of the U.S. team this week who won their other three games.
Molinari and Fleetwood go into Sunday's singles with the chance to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five.
Fleetwood has already claimed the most points in a single Ryder Cup by a European rookie.
Dubbed "Mollywood" by their newly-acquired army of fans, at first glance the pair might have looked unlikely contenders to lead the European charge.
Ryder Cup first-timers such as Fleetwood are not supposed to perform like this, while Molinari had failed to win any of his six previous matches, losing four of them.
However, a more positive view was that Fleetwood was European number one last year, knows the Le Golf National course inside out having won the French Open here in 2017, and showed his big-match temperament by finishing second in this year's U.S. Open.
Molinari is the freshly-minted British Open champion and widely regarded as the most consistent ball-striker on the European Tour - an attribute that has paid huge dividends on the tight course where finding the rough, as the Americans all-too-often did, was a recipe for disaster.
Those pedigrees, combined with what looked like a great on-course chemistry, proved an irresistible force.
"I feel a little bit emotional now and we're only on Saturday," said the famously laid-back Fleetwood, who has played all weekend with a huge smile on his face.
We were really good this afternoon, really solid and played really well.
To have your own piece of history together is really special.
I'm just glad we've done our job for the team."
Molinari was equally delighted.
"Playing alongside Tommy, it's been amazing," he said.
"But we've come to do a job, not to go in the record books, those 4-1/2 points we'll need tomorrow for the overall victory we will have to fight hard for; it's not going to be easy."
Knight fever!
Irish village transformed into medieval battlefield
Once the chief fortress of a powerful 15th century family descended from an English knight, the west of Ireland castle of Claregalway went back to its roots on Saturday.
Knights duel with swords during a medieval combat festival at Claregalway castle in Galway, Ireland September 29, 2018.
The grounds of the fully restored Anglo-Norman era tower house were transformed into a medieval battlefield as hundreds of enthusiastic visitors, many from around the world, re-enacted full contact combat and games from centuries ago.
Karl Dornan in costume as a Knight and Donna Dornan in costume as a Celtic warrior patrol the great hall of Claregalway Castle during a medieval combat festival in Galway, Ireland September 29, 2018.
"It's a nice weekend away and it's something different," said Denise Fitzgerald from County Kerry, who as the tavern owner for the weekend prepared food for the competitors by frying vegetables off in lard on a campfire.
"For me it's like getting back to basics.
I've been trying to do everything properly," said the theater worker, who was taking part in her first armored combat festival.
On the field, fighters dressed head to toe in authentic chain-mail armor battled it out and while their swords may have been blunt, some left with dented helmets and one, a cut lip.
Others on horseback showed off their skills by slicing cabbages and aubergines in half while on the move.
Nearby, metal smelters hammered weapons into shape, spice merchants prepared remedies and tradeswomen spun and dyed wool.
Deadly serious and exquisitely dressed, few dared to break character.
"Anyone can get dressed up but staying in character is an art form, I think," said Helena Stackpoole, who as "Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald" was putting her fashion design background to unique use.
"All the costumes are hand stitched.
I have a belt here that I'm embroidering and it's taken two years so far and the dress that I'm working on at the moment, the sleeves alone have 800 pearls hand sewn into them.
I'm a bit serious about this," she said.
Death toll from Indonesian quake, tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from an earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi rose to 832 on Sunday, the national disaster mitigation agency said, adding it assessed the affected area to be bigger than initially thought.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake which struck on Friday and triggered tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet), agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
FBI contact second accuser of court nominee Kavanaugh
FBI agents investigating U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have contacted the second woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct, her attorney said on Saturday.
The announcement by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer John Clune indicates that the FBI probe of Kavanaugh will look beyond separate allegations of attempted rape leveled against the conservative federal appeals court judge by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University dormitory when they were undergraduates.
U.S. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI investigation after Thursday's Senate hearing, during which Ford, a California university professor, detailed her claims that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when the two were still high school teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had constrained the FBI investigation by limiting its parameters.
Trump denied that story, tweeting that "Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion."
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate had set the "scope and duration" of the FBI probe, which is supposed to be wrapped up in a week.
"The White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do," Shah said.
UK will not give up environmental or animal standards after Brexit
The United Kingdom will not give up its high environmental or animal protection standards protections to win trade deals after Brexit, environment minister Michael Gove said on Sunday.
Britain's Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove arrives in Downing Street, London, September 24, 2018.
Speaking at an event on the fringes of the annual Conservative Party conference, Gove said it was an advantage for the United Kingdom to be known for quality food products and the government would announce a food strategy later this year.
Europe regain Ryder Cup with dominant singles display
Francesco Molinari fittingly took the glory as Europe regained the Ryder Cup in dominant style on Sunday, the Italian beating Phil Mickelson on the 16th to post the point needed to reach the magic tally of 14.5.
Mickelson conceded the hole after firing his tee shot into the water with Molinari on the green to leave the Italian as the first European to win all five matches in a week - having not won any of his previous six.
Europe were effectively already assured of victory when he teed off as the Italian, Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were all dormie and guaranteed at least half a point from their games - with Europe at that stage needing one.
They had started the day 10-6 up, needing to secure four and a half of the 12 points available to win back the trophy and extend their stranglehold on home soil that dates back to 1993.
Only twice before had a team come from four down going into the singles to win - the US doing so at Brookline in 1999 and Europe in 2012 in the "Miracle of Medinah," but another stunning comeback never really looked on the cards.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk's team a glimmer of hope with early wins but then the European points started pouring in from all over the course.
Thorbjorn Olesen hammered Jordan Spieth and fellow rookie Jon Rahm beat Tiger Woods - leaving the 14-times major champion with a stunning four defeats out of four.
Ian Poulter, "Mr Ryder Cup," then produced probably the loudest cheer of the week when world number one Dustin Johnson conceded on the 18th green to leave Europe on the verge.
It was then just a question of which match out on the course would finish next and it proved to be Molinari's - sparking amazing scenes of celebration watched by the biggest galleries in the event's history.
Neo-Nazi name used by German cops as codeword while guarding Erdogan on Berlin visit - RT World News
A pair of police officers in eastern Germany used the name of a notorious neo-Nazi extremist to work undercover during an operation to protect Turkish President Erdogan who visited Berlin this week, local media reveal.
Criminal police in the eastern German state of Saxony are inquiring into two members of elite counter-terrorism unit SEK, the regional interior ministry said.
The men were deployed to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his much-anticipated trip to Germany.
As the officers had to work undercover, protocol required that they use a codename.
Their choice was Uwe Boehnhardt, a notorious member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) - a neo-Nazi extremist group that slaughtered eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek citizen, and a German police officer in the 2000s.
The bizarre codename surfaced when the two signed up to access internal documents they needed for the deployment, local media report.
Officers in charge of the operation reacted swiftly, and the policemen were immediately recalled.
Petric Kleine, the head of Saxony criminal police, was first to react to the news.
He said the use of Boehnhardt's name was "hardly to be beaten in stupidity" and represented "blatant disregard of [his] victims and their relatives."
Roland Woller, Saxony's interior minister, echoed the words, calling it "disgusting, horrible and absolutely unacceptable."
Erdogan's Friday visit to Berlin has stirred considerable controversy in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for hosting a leader which some accuse of being increasingly authoritarian.
Merkel said the visit was very important "because when there are differences a personal meeting is vital to resolve them."
The NSU first came to light in 2011 when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were found inside a burnt-out motorhome in eastern Germany.
The two are believed to have died in an apparent murder-suicide after a failed bank robbery in a town of Eisenach.
Beate Zschaepe, the neo-Nazi gang's third and last surviving member, was detained shortly afterwards.
In July of this year, a German court sentenced her to life in prison, finding her guilty on 10 counts of murder.
She denied participating in the murders, although her lawyer said that she felt morally guilty for not trying to prevent the killings.
The scandal surrounding the NSU has led to widespread criticism of German security agencies.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of the victims believe that the group had far more accomplices.
It also came out that the BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, had placed numerous informants within the NSU and systematically thwarted and made impossible the investigation of murders, attempted murders, and robberies attributed to the group.
Musk to step down as Tesla chairman, pay $20mn fine as settlement with SEC
Elon Musk has settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which had sued him for fraud over his tweets about taking Tesla private.
Musk will have to step down as chairman, but gets to keep his CEO status.
According to the settlement filing, Musk has 45 days to step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, and is banned from holding the position for three years.
He will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
And since the whole affair started over a tweet, either careless or intentionally misleading, Musk is required to receive pre-approval for anything he says or posts about Tesla, "in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g., Twitter), the Company's website (e.g., the Company's blog), press releases, and investor calls."
Another $20mn will be paid by Tesla to settle claims it had failed to vet Musk's initial tweet.
The SEC complaint accused Musk of misleading investors with his August 7 tweet which said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, boosting the company's stock by more than 10 percent.
Musk soon recanted, saying he would keep Tesla private and triggering investors' fury.
The SEC ruled Musk's initial words "were false and misleading because they lacked any basis in fact."
Musk himself claimed it was an honest mistake, writing in a blog post that he was under the impression that he had secured the money in a meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.
Musk and the SEC had reportedly been close to a less punishing settlement, which would only have barred Musk from being chairman for two years and would not have required him to admit any guilt, but Musk backed out on Thursday.
Then on Friday, Tesla stock tanked, apparently causing him to change his mind again and accept the harsher conditions.
However, like the old deal, the new one does not require Musk to admit to being guilty of misleading investors.
Patriarch of Alexandria pledges support to canonical Ukrainian Church, urges Orthodox unity
Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has shown support for the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is part of the Moscow Patriarchate.
It comes amid a rift between the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.
Theodore II arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on Thursday, meeting high church representatives and the Orthodox faithful.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected hierarchs of the Orthodoxy, second only to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I have come here to tell you: Stay with the Orthodox faith and with the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
Ahead of the visit to Odessa, he met with the head of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Savva, who backed the canonical Ukrainian church as well.
The two also called for conflicts stemming from giving autocephality to the Ukrainian church to be avoided.
"We will always be with those who seeks the Orthodox unity," Theodore II pledged.
The Orthodox Church has faced a major crisis recently, following the Constantinople Patriarchy's move towards recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter is a constituent part of the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople has decided to send its exarchs to Kiev, effectively violating the rule in which one Orthodox Church is forbidden to interfere in the internal affairs of another.
Exarchs are special representatives of a patriarch, who technically have a higher position in the church hierarchy than Metropolitan Onufriy, the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to Constantinople's move, suspending the joint performance of church services and membership in all the structures led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
The decision, however, was said to be a "warning" to Constantinople against further hostile steps and does not constitute a complete break of inter-church ties.
Ukraine hosts three Orthodox Churches, yet only one of them - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate - is recognized by other Churches.
Most Ukrainian clerics recognize its authority, but the government has been openly courting one of the schismatic churches - the so-called Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.
The religious movement even has its own self-proclaimed "Patriarch" Filaret, who seeks to gain the official status of an Orthodox Church, fully independent and "equal" to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus reopens main Syria-Jordan trade crossing for 1st time in 3 years
The Syrian government said it will reopen its main Nasib border crossing with neighboring Jordan, which remained closed during three years of hostilities in the area, state news agency SANA reports.
The opening became possible after Syria's side of the crossing was cleared of militants holding swathes of land around the city of Daraa.
Nasib is a key point connecting trade routes between the neighboring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Major takeaways from Lavrov's UN speech
At the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lashed out at the West's "political blackmail and brute force," saying diplomacy should not give way to diktats and unilateral sanctions.
Trying to preserve their "self-proclaimed status as world leaders," some Western powers have no qualms about putting pressure on others, Foreign Minister Lavrov told the UN General Assembly on Friday.
He didn't name the countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force."
The world has to pay a high price for these selfish ambitions by a tiny group of countries.
Lavrov, who was once Russia's envoy to the UN for a decade, told the gathering that the culture of diplomacy and negotiating is being replaced by diktats and one-sided sanctions put in place without UN approval.
Such restrictions that extend to dozens of countries "are either unlawful or inefficient," the minister noted, citing the US" decades-long blockade of Cuba.
"But history didn't teach us anything," Lavrov said, adding that allegations "based on the notorious "highly likely" thing are sufficient for some Western counterparts to pin the blame on anyone."
We do remember how often these unfounded claims were used to justify interventions and ignite wars, such the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, 2003 invasion of Iraq and 2011 intervention in Libya.
The list of Western-led invasions was obviously not exhaustive, as Lavrov referred to the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest instances.
A failed attempt to topple the regime in Damascus - which was conducted by engaging extremists - could have seen the whole country collapse and give way to a "terrorist caliphate."
Lavrov praised the Astana Peace Process, launched jointly by Russia, Turkey, and Iran, which he said helped prevent Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and other groups from claiming all of Syria.
Top priority now is to rebuild war-ridden places in the country and help refugees safely return to their homes.
Jumping back to the great powers competition, Lavrov stated that the UN was in fact created "on the lessons learnt from the Second World War."
The Russian foreign minister noted that 2018 marks 80 years since the "disgraceful" 1938 Munich Agreement, in which France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazi annexation of the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia in a bid to appease Hitler.
Though Neville Chamberlain, then British prime minister, claimed the Munich Agreement meant "peace for our time," the war started one year later.
"The Munich betrayal" shows us how far "national egoism and neglect of international law" can go, Lavrov said.
"Colonial-era diktat and coercion should be sent into the archive or the dustbin of history."
Moscow believes constructive dialogue can meet any challenges that arise in world affairs, according to Lavrov.
"If you have any questions or claims to anyone, then sit down and talk, show facts, listen to your counterpart's arguments, try to balance your interests."
Mote in the eye?
What we know about Israel's murky "nukes" as Bibi points finger at Iran - RT World News
During his UN General Assembly (UNGA) speech, the Israeli PM was adamant that Tehran has secret nuclear sites.
As Israel keeps playing the blame game, let's see if they have their own radioactive skeletons in the closet.
Using his cherished "presentations," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out with his new revelations on Thursday, showing aerial photographs of Iranian sites allegedly holding nuclear-related material.
It did not take long for Tehran to fire back, saying Tel-Aviv is better to look at its own "undeclared nuclear weapons program."
While Israel has never admitted - notably, not denied as well - to possess military nukes, RT's Murad Gazdiev looks at whether Tel Aviv may really be not the right country to point its fingers at others.
Scottish Government: No complaints made against Alex Salmond before January
The Scottish Government has said there were no recorded complaints regarding Alex Salmond before January this year.
Two allegations of sexual harassment were made in January against the former first minister, who strongly denies the claims.
He was informed of an investigation in March.
Mr Salmond, who has since resigned from the SNP, is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.
The Scottish Government stressed no complaints had been recorded prior to January after claims that one of those complaints was first investigated in 2013.
A Scottish Government spokesman said: "The Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond.
These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.
No complaints were raised with the then deputy first minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.
We are confident our processes are legally sound and we will vigorously defend our position.
In the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.
However, as we have said previously, for legal reasons we can make no further comment on the issues relating to Mr Salmond at this time."
A spokesman for Alex Salmond said: "We have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session and we expect it to be called shortly.
We will do our talking in court.
Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government's complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."
Glasgow 29-13 Dragons: Lee Jones at double for Warriors
Glasgow got back to winning ways in the Guinness Pro14 with a bonus-point victory over Dragons at Scotstoun as coach Dave Rennie expressed satisfaction but felt his side could have been more clinical.
After the shock defeat by Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth the previous Saturday, Rennie had called for a response from a much-changed team and, while the maximum points were duly bagged to stay top of Conference A, it was far from emphatic in what was a disjointed encounter played in swirling wind and rain.
"I thought our defence was excellent tonight, we played at the right end of the field and our setpiece was great," said Rennie.
"We need to be a bit more clinical, there were more opportunities that had to be taken.
It was trying conditions.
We created lots of opportunities which we're happy about.
We want to be more clinical but having said that if we had put 40 or 50 points on the board tonight that wouldn't have been good for us.
We had to work for that.
A bonus-point win but we need to be better next week at home to Zebre and the week after against Saracens in Europe."
In windy conditions, Glasgow looked to have opened the scoring early but the TMO picked up the slightest of knock-ons from Huw Jones as he looked to have gathered Niko Matawalu's inside pass and gone over in the left corner.
The frustration didn't last long as in the fourth minute loosehead prop Oli Kebble burst through the middle and Adam Hastings pinged over the easy conversion.
Dragons reduced the lead with a penalty from Arwel Robson and the stand-off knocked over another just after the 20-minute mark to bring the Welsh to within a point.
A fairly tame opening half found some kind of life around the half-hour mark as Glasgow's forwards established a sustained siege of the Dragons line before South African referee Stuart Berry penalised the Welsh side for an offside tackle in the 22 on home stand-off Hastings.
Warriors opted for the scrum but surrendered possession before putting together their most fluid passage of play, left wing Matawalu not quite able to keep control of the ball after some punchy surges and a sweeping passing move out left.
The second try finally came two minutes from the interval when Hastings pierced the Dragons line and then popped a clever pass out to Lee Jones, whose momentum saw him crash over.
Hastings saw his conversion come back off the post to make it 12-6 at half-time.
Glasgow got off to the best possible start in the first minute of the second half as Alex Dunbar's delicious offload in the tackle was gleefully gobbled up by Lee Jones for his second try, Hastings adding the extras.
However, any sense that the Warriors would now run away with things received a setback just four minutes later when possession was coughed up in the midfield and a fly hack was followed up by Dragons centre Adam Warren who dribbled over to score under the posts, Josh Lewis, who had come on for Robson before the break, converting.
Warriors swiftly reasserted dominance and the bonus-point fourth try came in the 54th minute as Huw Jones surged over down the right, Hastings falling short with the conversion - his third miss from four attempts.
Glasgow remained in comfortable ascendancy and the fifth try came with a couple of minutes left as Dunbar got on the end of a sweet offload by sub scrum-half George Horne to cruise over and Hastings" boot completed the scoring.
Kebble was awarded man of the match but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously didn't want us to play and were flying up in the middle," said the coach.
"He probably needed to hold a couple of metres of depth but he's pretty slippery and managed to find some space in behind them.
He's in a good vein of form and confident."
Morton 1 - 5 Ayr United: Five star Ayr hammer hosts
Ayr stay top of the Championship table thanks to doubles from Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore and a goal from Declan McDaid.
Shankland swept Ayr into the lead from six yards after Michael Rose had headed a McDaid corner back across goal.
Morton levelled with their first effort on target on 35 minutes when Charlie Telfer robbed a dithering Robbie Crawford inside his own box and sent a low shot arrowing past Ayr keeper Ross Doohan and into the far corner.
The Greenock side were presented with a great opportunity to take the lead four minutes into the second half when Gary Oliver was sent tumbling by Doohan but Michael Tidser's penalty was weakly hit and easily gathered by the keeper.
Ayr moved in front a second time on 74 minutes when a cross from substitute Craig McGuffie was deflected high into the air and when it fell to earth fellow replacement Craig Moore prodded home.
Within a minute Moore cut the ball back for Shankland and the striker scored his 17th goal of the season.
As the visitors ran riot Moore rifled home the fourth from the edge of the box and McDaid slammed home a rebound to complete the scoring.
Alloa 0 - 2 Falkirk: Bairns earn first league win
"Delighted, relieved, happy," beamed Ray McKinnon after Falkirk finally registered their desperately-needed first league victory and points of the season.
A double from 18-year-old on-loan Rangers striker Zak Rudden either side of half-time hauled the Bairns level with hosts Alloa Athletic at the foot of the Championship and lifted a weight off the shoulders of the club.
"It was an important game for us," admitted McKinnon.
"In the last three games, we probably merited more, so it was nice to come here and pick up the three points in such a pressure situation.
I'm really pleased to get the first points on the board.
It wouldn't have been defining, but it was important we got the win."
Rudden nodded in a Patrick Brough cross in the 26th minute and then bundled in on the goal-line midway through the second-half after Deimantas Petravicius had lifted his lobbed shot over keeper Neil Parry.
"We hoped to make this place a fortress but that hasn't been the case," admitted Wasps manager Jim Goodwin.
More than 11,000 sign Hearts fan's petition against semi-final debacle
A Hearts fan's petition against the schedule of the Betfred Cup semi-finals has attracted more than 11,000 signatures.
It comes as anger continues to mount over the decision to play both semi-finals on the same day in the same stadium.
The SPFL opted last week, with the advice of Police Scotland, to schedule the Aberdeen v Rangers tie for 12pm and Hearts v Celtic for 7.45pm, provoking fury among fans of both the Jambos and the Dons.
The Evening News teamed up with the Aberdeen Evening Express on Saturday to call for a fair deal for fans.
The so-called "Super Sunday" decision was condemned by both Aberdeen and Hearts, the clubs releasing their own statements criticising the scheduling.
The petition was started on change.org on Thursday evening calling for one of the fixtures to be moved to another venue or be played on another date.
Man charged after two women die in stabbing in Kent village
Two women, aged in their 50s and 70s, died at the scene.
The man, also in his 70s, is in a stable condition in hospital, according to a force spokeswoman.
The 28-year-old, who lives on the street, remains in custody and will face two counts of murder and one of attempted murder when he appears via video link at Medway Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Police have not yet named the victims but believe they and the suspect knew each other.
Neighbours spoke of their shock of what had happened in such a "quiet and friendly" village.
Sophie Moorey-Brown, 31, told the Press Association: "We've lived here for five years and never heard anything bad happen, it has always been so quiet and a lovely place to be."
Royal archives team up with Hamilton to teach the world about King George III
When the Queen launched a project to open her enormous archive of papers from the reign of George III, it was hoped the letters, diaries and speeches would give the public an insight far beyond his reputation for madness.
Now, those papers are to reach a whole new audience, as the Royal Archives form an unlikely alliance with a hit West End musical.
The actor who plays George III in Hamilton has been invited into the library at Windsor Castle to study key documents from the reign of the Queen's great-great-great-great- grandfather, as academics hope to inspire others to learn more about the real king.
Those documents will now be made available digitally for the show's legions of fans, as researchers work to bring their "pieces of paper with old handwriting on" to a wider audience.
Members of the Royal family have already given their public approval to the musical, with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex going to see it twice despite Prince Harry's ancestor being thoroughly sent up on stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays the role in the West End, said he had been left with a lot to think about after studying the papers, which shed light on the king who is sealed in the public's imagination from his portrayal in Hamilton, The Madness of King George and the children's series Horrible Histories.
'We fell in love' after 'beautiful letters'
US President Donald Trump took his enthusiasm for his detente with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to new heights on Saturday, declaring at a rally with supporters that "we fell in love" after exchanging letters.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim have said they want to work toward denuclearising the Korean peninsula, holding an unprecedented meeting earlier this year in Singapore to discuss the idea.
Before they turned the page on decades of public acrimony, the leaders regularly traded threats and insults as North Korea pushed to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States.
"I was really being tough - and so was he.
And we would go back and forth," Mr Trump told a rally in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, okay?
No, really - he wrote me beautiful letters, and they're great letters," he said.
Lekavičius and “Panathinaikos” got into the Greek Cup semi-final
The Athens “Panathinaikos” celebrated a victory in the quarterfinals of the Greek Cup without big efforts of Lukas Lekavičius.
The Athens team in the away match defeated the Patras “Prometheus” team 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18).
The Lithuanian spent 14 minutes in the court, scored 4 points (2/2 two points), grabbed one rebound, made one successful pass and got two fouls.
Nick Calathes was the most efficient scoring 15 points for “Panathinaikos”.
Skvernelis’ blow to Šimonytė: everything was decided by the party’s “cream”
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the internal elections of the Conservative Party, and the party leadership actually nominated Ingrida Šimonytė as a presidential candidate.
“The very “democracy” celebration, however, was strange, to say the least, when the party’s cream, the leadership decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate did not have even a theoretical chance to win”, said S.Skvernelis to the journalists in the Government.
“The Conservative Party has nominated their candidate, and with that we congratulate them”, added the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister delegated by the “Farmers Greens”, said that I.Šimonytė should be evaluated by the voters, who remember her work in Andrius Kubilius’ Government.
S. Skvernelis is not yet commenting on whether he himself will participate in the presidential election.
Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union plans to approve their candidate next year.
Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the “farmers”, called the conservative elections “an unsuccessful experiment” due to the low activity of members of the party.
“First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment, which has absolutely failed.
Only 55% members of the party participated, in total only about 20 thousand voters.
Knowing what money had to be spent on organizing these elections, one thing is clear - that it did not work”, said R.Karbauskis to the news portal delfi.lt.
“I think that the cost will not justify the result, because there is no result, the party has decided that this is their candidate - and everything is fine, but why to spend so much money”, added he.
During the weekend’s internal elections, 79% of the members of the Conservative Party and their supporters voted for I.Šimonytė’s candidacy.
Lithuanian salaries amuse Estonians: one area can change everything
According to the data of the salary survey conducted by the “Baltic Salary Survey” this year in the Baltic States, the biggest salary increase was in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia were not far behind their neighbour, says the company's press release.
“Having surveyed 850 companies and analyzed salary changes in the Baltic States, we see that monthly salary before taxes in Lithuania increased for 81.8% employees by 7.7% on average, and annual salary with bonuses increased by 10.5% this year.
Latvia has slightly overtaken us - there was a slightly bigger increase in annual salary, but, like in Estonia, for a smaller number of employees compared to our country”, says Povilas Blusius, a representative of the company that organizes salary surveys, and he adds that with such salary increase trends the general economic indicators of the country that dictate them should be taken into account.
The biggest salary increase was in Estonia
Although in Latvia and Estonia salaries increased for a smaller number of employees than in Lithuania, but the increase was bigger.
In Latvia, the annual salary increased for 71% of the surveyed employees of the companies, and the increase was a little bigger than in our country - 11%.
This year, in Estonia, salary was raised for 73% of employees, and increased on average by 13%.
The salary increase trends are strongly influenced by employee turnover, as those who change jobs can receive much higher salary than at the previous workplace.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in the recent years and did not get better posts, annual salary increased by 8.8%, and bonuses here were paid more often than in other Baltic countries.
In neighboring Latvia, the annual increase in salary for such employees was 3.6%.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States for the biggest increase of salaries not only for the new, but also for the long-term employees.
For those, who did not change either workplace or position, the salary increased the most: monthly - 6%, annual with bonuses - even 9%.
According to the salary research specialist, such trends often depend on or coincide with the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, the state monetary policy, prevailing moods in the market.
For example, forecasts about the coming economic downturn encourage business to act more cautiously and to invest less.
Dominant and fast growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also increase general statistics and overshadow minor changes.
The biggest tax burden falls on the Latvian people
When comparing salary increase, it is important to take into account different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the largest part of the taxes depending on their salary - even 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42,4% for those who earn more.
In Lithuania there is a fixed 24% rate, therefore, with higher salary increase in Latvia, employees may have the same or even less perceptible gain than in Lithuania.
In Estonia, a similar tax rate applies as in Lithuania - 23.6%, thus in this country we find the most favorable taxes for the labour force in the Baltic States.
The most competitive salary - in IT field
According to the results of the survey, in all the Baltic States, almost regardless of the position, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation is in retail trade - market indexes in this area are among the lowest, so the employees earn less than the market average.
Compared to the last year, the salary increased most for engineers, for those who are in higher positions as well as for risk management specialists.
This year salaries also increased for some positions in IT field - a large part of the organizations increased monthly salaries up to 14% for information security specialists.
Meanwhile, salaries remained almost unchanged in retail trade.
However, some companies have successfully implemented reorganizations of salary systems, therefore, their annual salaries increased about 2% due to the bonuses.
According to salary specialists, there is a tendency that salary increase dictates the need for the most demanded specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: former fiance won’t stop making jokes
After break up with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson spills out his pain by making jokes about their relationship.
On “Saturday Night Live”, he chose to joke about how quickly he gets into serious relationship.
Fans say that it is true, because just three weeks ago Ariana and Pete canceled their engagement that took place just a few months after they met.
Pete tried to create scenarios where he mentioned his failed relationship, but they will appear on screens a bit later.
It is rumored that the comedian, who is making jokes about his former relationship, is annoying Ariana.
These jokes are hurtful to her, and she does not like them.
At least, this is what secret sources told the foreign news portal TMZ.
White or brown: what kind of sugar is recommended by the nutritionist
White or brown?
Which sugar to choose?
Surveys at the supermarkets revealed that while Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar, it is surprising that many people do not use this ingredient, that is also called white death, at all.
Representatives of supermarket chains do not hide that sales of brown sugar are increasing.
According to the representative of “Maxima”, brown sugar is becoming increasingly popular, and people are buying more and more of it, although ordinary white sugar is still a preferable choice.
Organic sugar sales are also increasing in specialized ecological stores.
One of their most popular products is coconut sugar.
According to nutritionist Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, but both can have harmful effects on health.
“Brown non-refined sugar is three times more expensive, but from the health point of view these sugars, if used in excess, are harmful to the body”, said Vaitkevičiūtė.
For those who cannot live without sugar, the nutritionist advises to reduce its amounts little by little.
This will have many benefits - one can lose unwanted kilograms and improve health.
If one reduces sugar amount consistently during a month, it will be easier to stop using it at all.
“It takes about a month to form every habit, so after such an experiment, let’s say, drinking some product, coffee or tea, without sugar for a month, we will see its positive effect, and I think that everyone can give it up with a little effort”, advises nutritionists on how to give up on sugar.
Doctors say that sugar is called white death for a reason - abusing sweets can cause obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
Therefore, it would be worth trying to consume as little sugar as possible, because this product is also added to many foods, including bread.
Another “Lietkabelis” step: Lipkevičius is lent to another LBL team
“Lietkabelis” team of Panevėžys said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevičius - the forward is being lent to Prienai “Skycop” team.
In this “Betsafe-LKL” season, V.Lipkevičius used to score 6.4 points, rebound 2.8 balls, make 2 successful passes and had 8.5 performance score in 22 minutes.
In the FIBA Champions League, the 29-year-old 198 cm athlete’s statistics was 3.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 successful passes and 4.8 performance score in 21 minutes of the game.
In the near future “Lietkabelis” will announce a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S.Buškevicas joined the coaching staff
Sandis Buškevicas, well known to the Lithuanians, became the assistant of the chief coach Nenadas Čanakas of Panevėžys “Lietkabelis” team.
41-year-old Latvian played in Vilniaus “Lietuvos rytas” in the season of 2005-2006, and in 2014-2017 he worked as the assistant chief coach in this club’s system.
Last season, S.Buševicas trained Jekabpils’ team “Jekabpils”.
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Steponas Babrauskas to the staff, but he is going to continue the career of a basketball player.
Vytenis Jasikevičius was also invited, but the two sides failed to come to an agreement.
S.Buškevicas will work together with Roberas Kuncaitis and Algimantas Bružas at the “Lietkabelis” coaching staff.
The Latvian will join “Lietkabelis” on Tuesday and will be in “Cido” arena during the FIBA Champions League match with Dijon’s JDA, but we will not see him on the bench yet as the registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Not everyone will like the reduction in biofuel prices
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more leafy trees will be cut in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, the intention is to “impact” the prices of biofuel.
“We have a large collection of certain types.
There is a need to disturb the balance (...).
There is a focus on soft leafy trees, because we can have some impact on the prices of biofuel”, said K.Navickas on Tuesday in Seimas, presenting the situation regarding deforestation.
According to K.Navickas, wood prices in Lithuania increased by about 20% this year.
According to the minister, next year the number of cut pines will be the same as this year, while the number of cut firs will decrease about 80 hectares.
He said that in Lithuania more wood is cut due to favorable natural conditions.
“This should not happen next year”, said K.Navickas.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state owned, and 800 thousand ha of forests are private.
Questionable obligation to the fight with food prices: encouragement to buy only in own area
Among the measures provided by the Ministry of Economy for the reduction of prices is the obligation for public bodies and organizations to purchase 50% of food from local producers, announced news portal 15min.lt.
“The law would apply not only to the small regional retailers, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or stationery could be supplied to the municipality buyer by local companies that have successfully won the tenders”, said Virginijus Sinkevičius, Minister of Economy.
Egidijus Mockevičius, the president of the Association of Meat Processors, has no doubt that this provision will discriminate against some businessmen, and it would be difficult to control whether the law is not misused by resellers.
Valdas Sutkus, the head of the Confederation of Enterprises, also criticizes the inconsistency of the measure.
Macron urges Europe to defend against Russia and US
On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on to create a "real European army" to allow the bloc to defend itself against Russia and even the United States.
E. Macron, who has pushed for a joint European Union military force since his arrival in power, said that Europe needs to decrease its dependency on the American military might.
He has gained a significant argument after the US President Donald Trump announced that Washington will pull out of an important Cold War-era nuclear treaty.
“We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,” E.Macron told radio station “Europe 1”.
It was his first radio interview since becoming the president in May 2017.
“When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security”, said the French leader.
The aforementioned missile crisis was triggered by a non-strategic nuclear arms race at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major contributor for the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987.
“We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army”, said E.Macron in an interview recorded on Monday evening in Verden, North East France, during the President’s visit to the battlefields of the World War I this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to E.Macron, in a situation “when Russia, which is at our borders and has shown that it can be a threat..., we need Europe which defends itself better alone, without just depending on the United States.”
The leader of France has become a main spearhead pushing the creation of a nine-country European force that could rapidly mount a joint military operation, evacuate civilians from a war zone or provide aid after a natural disaster.
Defense ministers of these nine countries are set to meet for the first time on Wednesday in Paris to start discussing details of how this force will operate.
European Union is due to vastly expand its defense budget starting in 2021, allocating some 13 billion euros over seven years to research and development of new equipment.
Current EU defense budget is less than 600 million euros.
However, Bruno Alomar, a professor at the French War School, which trains top military officers, said that E.Macron’s vision of a tight-knit European defense force was a long way off.
“The idea of creating a common strategic culture is not a bad one,” he told news agency AFP.
“But there’s a massive gap between the European defense that Emmanuel Macron dreams about and the reality of very big disagreements between European partners.”
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we are not idiots
Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, said on Tuesday that his country would need new weapons, if NATO continues to mobilize forces on the western border of Belarus.
“If NATO continues to intimidate by deploying bases in Poland or in any other way, Belarus will need more sophisticated weapons, first of all, missiles”, state news agency BelTA quotes words of A.Lukashenko who met with a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The head of the state also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
“As you noticed, and we are not hiding, that we have lately developed our own rocket industry and produced our own high-precision missiles”, stressed the President.
A.Lukashenko said last week that Minsk and Moscow are looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to the plans to build a Polish base and name it “Fort Trump”, after the President of the United States Donald Trump.
“Of course this concerns us.
If, for instance, in Poland they’re saying they’re willing to spend millions of dollars to deploy [...] some Fort Trump there, of course we are not idiots, and of course we will respond to that”, A.Lukashenko said at a Munich Security Conference Core Group Meeting in Minsk.
“Of course, we, together with our main ally [Russia], are thinking about how we could oppose this and how we could find the proper response with minimum costs”, he said.
Relationship between the West and Moscow heavily deteriorated after annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014.
Their relationship is also worsened by the role of Moscow in the Syrian conflict and an attempt by, supposedly, Russia’s special services to poison the former double agent Sergey Skripal with a substance that paralyzes the nerves, which was carried out in Great Britain this year in March.
The tension between Moscow and Washington was further aggravated after D.Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Weapons Regulation.
Russia warned that this step could ruin the global security system.
The man who performed a cruel execution revealed how he killed the football player who raped his wife
Brazil was shaken by brutal crime during which a fierce execution was performed on this country's football player Daniel Correa Freitas.
The athlete was killed during a 18-year-old girl’s birthday party.
A 24-year-old football player was found dead in Parana, in the south east of Brazil.
It is reported that he was executed: his genitals were cut off, it was also reported about severe injuries in the neck.
Edison Brittes Junior, 38, who killed the football player, admitted his guilt and claimed to have done so because D.C.Freitas had raped his wife, Cristiana Brittes.
The Brazilian, who executed the terrible murder, later during the television broadcast explained in detail what happened on the fateful night.
“The party had already gained momentum when I realized that I had not seen my wife Cristiana for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I immediately broke down the door, and saw naked Daniell in bed and my wife, who was asking for help.
I was deadly angry.
Together with my friends at the party, we dragged him outside and jammed him in the car.
Here I had a knife, with which I stabbed the man who had raped my wife to death.
I was very angry, at that moment I could not control myself”, said the murderer.
Together with his friends, he threw the dead body of the footballer near the river, where police officers are looking for the main tool of the brutal crime.
The Civil Brazilian Police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and the daughter who celebrated her birthday.
It is reported that police officers investigating the incident still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the party.
However, recently distributed last messages and photos of the football player on “WhatsApp” application may help the investigation.
The football player sent two photographs via “WhatsApp” to one of his friends, in which he took a photo of himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who, as it turned out later, was the murderer’s wife Cristiana.
“I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in various rooms in the house.
I will eat the birthday girl’s mother, although her father is somewhere nearby”, the football player wrote to his buddy.
Daniel Correa Freitas, who belonged to “Sao Paulo” club, this season was lent to “Sao Bento” that competed in the second strongest league in Brazil.
Daughter of Paul Walker, who died in a tragic accident, has celebrated her 20th birthday: did not manage without tears
Daughter of actor Paul Walker, who died in a tragic accident, has celebrated a special occasion - her 20th birthday.
Five years ago, the model Meadow Walker has lost one the most loved people in the world and still remains behind the wall of silence.
The girl, who is extremely rarely seen in social networks, left her teenage years celebrating her birthday in tears.
She commemorated it by taking a photo with a little cake with a pink number “20”.
Photos, in which the girl cries on her birthday, were spread online, but they were quickly removed from social networks.
After the death of the actor, Meadow was raised only by her mother, Rebecca Soteros.
Paul Walker’s brother and wife mentioned more than once that his daughter meant everything to the actor.
He was very proud of her.
Austin Powers' fans are going crazy: another part of the film is coming
The cult comedy "Austin Powers" has fascinated millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, funny shots and costumes are still an inspiration to many fans.
The film's creator and lead star, Mike Myers, announced that the fourth Austin Powers film is coming.
However, we will not see one of the main actors who played “Mini Me” in the film.
Actor Verne Troyer, who played him, died at the beginning of this year at the age of 49.
In October, it was confirmed that the actor himself took away his life.
Mike Myers assured that Verne will be really missed in the world of Austin Powers - without him, the film will not be the same.
Verne was a fantastic comedy actor.
When we wrote the script, his character was not very special - he has created all the popularity himself.
He was a great stunt performer, a great dancer and a wonderful person”, said Mike Myers about him.
Juliette Lewis joins cast of 'Roseanne' spinoff 'The Conners'
A Million Little Pieces and Camping star Juliette Lewis confirmed via Twitter she has joined the cast of the Roseanne spinoff The Conners.
"Yep this is happening.
The secret is out!! #JulietteLewisisontheconners #TheConners," the actress tweeted this week, along with a photo of her holding a script with the sitcom's name emblazoned on the front of it.
Another post features a photo of Lewis with Johnny Galecki and Sara Gilbert, who play exes David and Darlene on the show.
"Guess who's stoppin by #TheConners ??!!
Reuniting with my Grizwald brother!
So exciting.
The writing is SOOOOO GOOOD. #JulietteLewisisonTheConners," Lewis wrote.
Lewis and Galecki played siblings Audrey and Rusty Griswold in the 1989 movie Christmas Vacation.
The Hollywood Reporter said Lewis will play Galecki's girlfriend Blue, but it is unclear in how many episodes they will appear.
The Conners is scheduled to debut on Oct.
It earned high ratings when it returned this spring and was renewed for another season, but the show was canceled and creator-star Roseanne Barr was fired in May after Barr tweeted a racist joke about a former Obama administration official.
Most of the original cast members from Roseanne -- including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman -- are to star in The Conners.
Showtime cancels 'I'm Dying Up Here' after two seasons
"I'm Dying Up Here," a Showtime dramedy Jim Carrey produced, has been canceled after two seasons.
Showtime has declined to order a third season of the Jim Carrey-produced dramedy I'm Dying Up Here.
Deadline.com said low viewership was to blame for the cable network's decision to cancel the show.
Starring Melissa Leo, Ari Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy and Andrew Santino, the series took place in the stand-up comedy scene of 1970s Los Angeles.
"I'm very grateful for these last three years. when people ask me about the show, i say "it's a complicated show about complicated people...but it was really fun to make." thanks for watching xox," Angarano tweeted Friday.
Jada Pinkett Smith, Shonda Rhimes producing 'American Son' on Broadway

The play's ensemble features Kerry Washington, Steven Pasquale, Eugene Lee and Jeremy Jordan.
Christopher Demos-Brown penned the drama and Kenny Leon is directing it.
Performances will begin Oct. 6, with an official opening night planned for Nov.
"A Florida police station in the middle of the night," a synopsis said.
American Son is a gripping tale about who we are as a nation, and how we deal with family relationships, love, loss, and identity.
Writer-producer Rhimes and Washington previously worked together on the ABC political drama Scandal for seven seasons.
Eva Green, Marton Csokas to star in BBC drama 'The Luminaries'
Penny Dreadful actress Eva Green, Into the Badlands actor Marton Csokas and Robin Hood alum Eve Hewson are to star in the BBC's six-part drama, The Luminaries.
The series based on Eleanor Catton's Man Booker Prize-winning novel is to begin filming in November.
The story takes place during the 1860s gold rush in New Zealand.
Eleanor has written a series of brilliant screenplays.
I loved her original novel and it's so exciting that her own screen adaptation reveals yet more exquisite material," Green said in a statement.
"I've had tremendous fun adapting this novel for the screen and feel incredibly lucky to be working with such fantastic people across different art forms," Catton added.
"Writing a novel is a solitary business, but writing for the screen is emphatically collaborative, and to see the world of The Luminaries enlarged and enriched in ways that go far beyond the scope of my own imagination has been a humbling and hugely exhilarating experience.
I couldn't be happier that the brilliant Claire McCarthy is at the helm, and I can't wait to see this incredible cast bring the story to life."
Redshirt season no longer a possibility for Alabama's Hurts
The idea of Alabama backup quarterback Jalen Hurts possibly redshirting this season came to an end Saturday.
Hurts was inserted into Saturday's matchup for the top-ranked Crimson Tide against overmatched Louisiana, marking the fifth game he has appeared in this season.
Per a new NCAA rule this season, a player can appear in as many as four games and still qualify for a redshirt season.
A report by the Athletic earlier this month suggested Hurts was planning to take that route due to his frustration over the quarterback controversy and how it was handled by the team's coaching staff.
Tua Tagovailoa supplanted Hurts as the starter this season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he still plans to take advantage of Hurts' skill set.
Hurts guided Alabama to the national championship game against Georgia last season, but he was replaced in the second half by Tagovailoa, who rallied the Crimson Tide to a 26-23 victory.
The former SEC Offensive Player of the Year, Hurts entered this season having started the previous 28 games for Alabama, posting a 26-2 record.
Entering Saturday's contest, Hurts completed 22 of 31 passes for 276 yards with four touchdowns and one interception in the Crimson Tide's first four games.
He also rushed 15 times for 54 yards.
Owens: Dez needs to act on idea of signing 'soon'
Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant predicted he will "soon" be returning to the NFL.
Hall of Famer Terrell Owens said for Bryant's sake, that time can't come soon enough.
Responding to a question on Twitter on when he plans to sign with a team, Bryant on Friday offered a one-word tweet: "Soon."
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bryant has been without a team since the Dallas Cowboys released him in mid-April in a salary dispute.
Bryant, who reportedly rejected a contract offer from the Baltimore Ravens and has continually been linked to the Cleveland Browns, said just prior to the season that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with a team.
Owens, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August and still makes noises about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant's focus should be on getting back on the field -- immediately.
"He has to get on the team and prove to everyone what he feels like he is capable of doing," Owens told the website.
"Because everybody, if you listen to all the commentators, they feel he's lost a step, he's not the guy he once was, that he feels like he is.
At this point the game, get on a roster, no matter what the money is -- if its's a one-year deal, two-year deal, whatever the case may be -- and show everybody what you're made of, what you're capable of doing."
Bryant had a team-leading 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns with Dallas in 2017.
The 29-year-old has gone a career-long 23 regular-season games without a 100-yard performance.
Since signing a five-year, $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant has failed to record a 1,000-yard season or make more than eight touchdown receptions in a season.
"From a general manager's or owner's standpoint, when they feel your skillset is declining, you're not going to warrant or garner that money you're really looking for," advised Owens,.
Warning that if Bryant doesn't find his way onto a roster in the near future, "then it's not going to happen," Owens said the idea of a reunion with the struggling Cowboys should be pursued.
"Absolutely. I dont know if that relationship is fractured," said Owens, who had 38 touchdowns in three seasons with Dallas.
"I think for Dez, if the Cowboys welcomed him back and he gets an opportunity, then that bodes well for Dez and the franchise."
CERN Business Incubation Center in Lithuania is being discussed
Last week, representatives from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) paid a visit to Kaunas in order to evaluate the possibility to establish CERN Business Incubation Centre in Lithuania.
There are ten business incubators throughout Europe up to date in which companies receive support for the commercialization of CERN technologies, the development of innovative products and their adaptation to the needs of society.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of the organization's business incubator in the country had already been discussed.
In Kaunas, CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and the Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering at KTU (Kaunas University of Technology) in Santaka Valley.
In the meeting at the National Innovations and Entrepreneurship Centre (NIEC), the guests together with the representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Economy and businesses discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because, if established in Lithuania, CERN Business Incubation Centre will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will make great impact on the regional community of science and business innovators.
“Such incubator could accelerate the application of CERN expertise and technologies for solving important problems, for example, new technologies and artificial intelligence could be used for diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, as well as big data processing”, said Dr. Leonas Balaševičius, KTU Vice-Rector for Research and Innovation.
CERN incubators, like other new business development centers, provide assistance in business development - provide information and expert advice on customizing technology in product development and help find sources of funding.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more oriented towards science.
Such centre in Lithuania could engage experts in various fields: information technologies, material engineering as well as medical specialists.
CERN organization is best known for its Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator located in Switzerland.
However, CERN does not only investigate quantum mechanics, but also other areas - from cryogenics (impact of very cold materials to substances) to particle monitoring and radiation testing.
These technologies and work of scientists have impact on society in many important fields: medicine, security and industry development.
"Vilniaus degtinė" has a new general manager
The producer of beverages “Vilniaus degtinė” has appointed Rokas Mituzas as the new general manager, who will replace Raimonda Pilkė.

SIS detained R.Ačas - Business News
Former parliamentarian and former director of Raseiniai District Municipality Administration Remigijus Ačas is suspected of bribery.
He is detained.
The Special Investigation Service (SIS) reports that Šiauliai Board officials are carrying out a preliminary investigation regarding possible corruption in the Raseiniai District Municipality.
“Former director of Raseiniai District Municipality Administration R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - editor’s note) is suspected of bribery.
Circumstances regarding untransparent public procurement while R. A. was a director of the municipality are being investigated - a possible exceptional advantage to one private company to conclude an agreement of public procurement with the company managed by Raseiniai District Municipality.
It is suspected that for this, R.A. received a bribe of high value (more than 250 times the minimum monthly wage)”, is said in the SIS press release.
BNS adds that this company is “Raseinių autobusų parkas”.
On Monday, officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the head of “Raseinių autobusų parkas”, the company managed by Raseiniai Municipality, who is suspected of corruption.
This was confirmed to BNS by SIS spokeswoman Renata Endružytė.
The SIS report said that allegations were also made to two business representatives who directly bribed Mr. Ačas or participated in masking bribes in various financial transactions.
All suspects have been detained, and their workplaces and homes have been searched.
Suspended membership in SDLP
Remigijus Ačas was the director of the Raseiniai District Municipality Administration for some time, but in April, after the Council did not approve his report, he lost this post.
He was also the Mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Mr. Ačas is a longtime member of the Seimas, he was being elected to the Parliament since 2004 as a candidate for the party “Order and Justice”.
However, in 2013 his and the party’s ways have parted, and in 2016 he did not manage to win an independent mandate in the elections to the Seimas.
At present Mr. Ačas belongs to the newly established Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) that has split from the Social Democrats and is led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Shortly after this news, Kirkilas, the chairman of the SDLP, announced in the press release that Mr. Ačas temporarily suspended his membership in the party while the investigation is taking place.
“The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the allegations regarding Remigijus Ačas are an unpleasant surprise to us, but in all cases law enforcement needs to take all necessary steps to find out the truth.
R. Ačas temporarily suspended membership in the party while the preliminary investigation is taking place”, says Kirkilas, the leader of SDLP.
In 2003 Mr. Ačas was a national security advisor, the head of the advisory group of the former President Rolandas Paksas, who was subsequently removed from the office during the impeachment.
Mayor A.Gricius: I did not directly control work of R.Ačas
Algirdas Gricius, the Mayor of Raseiniai District, and Liudas Kavaliauskas, the current head of the municipality administration, said to BNS on Monday that they had no information what particular procurement could be related to the law enforcement investigation.
Mayor Gricius said he had learned of the arrest of Mr. Ačas from the media.
"I cannot really say, we were very distanced by our functions, I, as a Mayor, was doing my job, he (Ačas - BNS) was working for the administration, and I cannot say for what reasons or which public procurement this case was started”, said the mayor to BNS on Monday.
He also said that for the same reasons he is not willing to evaluate former leadership of Mr. Ačas in the municipality administration.
“I am afraid to say anything, that I could evaluate his work, since I did not directly control his administration work, I was presented with public procurements, competitions, told that such public procurements, such competitions took place, then what was visible in public space, concluded contracts, I saw this already as Mayor.
Therefore, I cannot tell how he managed administration when he was its director”, said Mr. Gricius.
He said that he himself did not intervene in public procurement and did not influence them.
New advisor in the team of the Ministry of Culture
Associated professor Juozapas Blažiūnas complemented the team of advisors of the Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson.
He will advise the Minister on archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management.
The Ministry of Culture reported that Mr. Blažiūnas, who acquired the Doctor of Arts degree in art studies at the Vilnius Academy of Arts, has from 2016 until now been the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive, associate professor of the Department of Museology at the Faculty of Communication at Vilnius University.
Actually, in 2017, the students of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University elected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best professor of the faculty.
The new Minister’s advisor is the author of many scientific articles on the preservation of cultural heritage and properties.
The change would not stop
VŽ reminds that in May of this year, Dr. Viktoras Bachmetjevas, advisor to the Minister on public information policy issues, who was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication, has left the team of the Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson.
On October 2, Renaldas Augustinavičius has announced his resignation from the post of the Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Ms. Ruokytė-Jonsson said that her new vice-minister would be responsible for the same areas as Mr. Augustinavičius.
At present, besides Mr. Blažiūnas, who is overtaking the areas supervised by Mr. Augustinavičius, the team of the Minister’s advisors consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and the senior advisor Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: because of inoperative PPWIS business faces 90 million euros in fines
Simonas Gentvilas, vice-chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, said that because of the poorly functioning Product, Packaging and Waste Record Keeping Information System (PPWIS), at the end of the year Lithuanian manufacturers and importers may have to pay almost 90 million euros in fines.
“As the end of the year approaches, and the PPWIS system does not start functioning normally, the system crisis in the packaging industry sector is becoming a more realistic scenario.
It is unofficially stated that only 1% of certificates that certify packaging waste management were issued of the intended recycling tasks”, said Mr. Gentvilas in the press release.
On 7 November, the member of the Seimas initiates an extraordinary meeting of the Environmental Protection Committee, with intention to discuss the situation, to find out why this program is not functioning, why the module of the program is not being actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
“Without the necessary legislative or regulatory initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at the risk of having to pay huge environmental pollution taxes by the end of this year”, says Mr. Gentvilas.
In his opinion, the drawbacks and inaction of the PPWIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the “Metrail” crisis.
Concern regarding tasks
Some experts warn that some companies may not be able to implement packaging waste recycling tasks set out by the state for 2018.
After seeing the results of packaging recycling rates of the first half-year released by the organizations, the specialists argue that there are grounds for concern that some organizations may not be able to handle the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some of the companies might no longer be able to benefit from the pollution tax exemption and would have to pay pollution tax for a certain amount of their yearly packaging released to the market.
VŽ wrote that two out of three current producer organizations reject such concerns, while one of them does not provide any comments.
Kęstutis Pocius, the CEO of the largest organization Public Institution “Žaliasis taškas”, said that at least formally the completion of tasks depends on solving the problems of the Product, Packaging and Waste Record Keeping Information System (PPWIS).
“Žaliasis taškas” plans that this year it will be possible to complete all types of packaging management tasks, except for glass.
Although “Žaliasis taškas” will not be able to complete a glass task this year, the organization promises to compensate members for the resulting losses.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
While the government is planning to distribute food coupons to the less wealthy people and thus promote family or farmers trade, experts question the benefits of such an innovation.
They agree that the new system will create additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, the head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are outdated and will not solve the problem, and the Government should focus on increasing people’s income.
“The system looks rather strange and seems to be taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help the public purchase something or have more purchasing power, we have to use all our capabilities to increase people’s income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy at one store or another”, said Mr. Dubnikovas to BNS.
According to him, by offering food coupons the Government would indulge lower income people.
“Obviously, the target is people with lower income, as if a voucher is put on a tray and it is written on it, here, we, this Government, gave you a voucher, so be kind to us.
It sounds like some pre-election promises, where they want to put their signature to them very clearly”, said the analyst.
According to him, the food coupon system will require additional investment, and it will increase the administrative burden as it will be necessary to supervise who and how issues them, what is their protection against counterfeiting.
Nerijus Mačiulis, the chief economist of “Swedbank” said that it would not be possible to achieve both goals - supporting people with low income and small businesses - with one instrument.
“If this is the support to small businesses, vouchers help to compensate for price differences and residents can buy more expensive goods in smaller stores, then the price difference is compensated by the state from the budget.
Then this is a support for business, but not for the residents”, said Mr. Mačiulis to BNS.
In his opinion, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially change the competitive position of small stores, and, on the contrary, it would create additional bureaucratic burden and could complicate the entry of new market participants.
“It looks like it’s a rather bureaucratic instrument with a lot of administrative costs and it’s also quite uncomfortable for the residents, they should not shop at some bigger store with larger assortment closer to home, but look for several specialized stores with smaller assortment”, the economist said.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries when there is a limited amount of goods or services and they need to be given to everyone alike, or to some kind of a social group.
Then, residents receive coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr. Mačiulis they are also used in the labor market by providing temporary tax relief to enterprises, employing the long-term unemployed, or, for example, former prisoners.
Such practice, according to Mr. Mačiulis, was successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the new food coupon system that is considered by the Government would help the poorest people, increase competition, encourage the business of small traders or farmers.
Skirmantas Malinauskas, advisor of the Prime Minister, told BNS on Monday that the idea is mostly oriented towards farmers and family businesses, while purchasers with coupons could receive a 20-30% discount.
According to him, the number of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not misuse them.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to save 10-15 euros per month.
In his opinion, although the state budget does not provide funds for the program yet, it could be financed from this source, also possibly from the European Union funds.
“Not everything that is currently foreseen or not foreseen in the budget will be final, it will change in the Seimas, as it happens, funds from one line can be transferred to another, and from the ministries, objects of financing can be changed.
It is always a matter of priority, what kind of decision it would be - whether it is by refusing something, finding another additional source of income and so on”, said Mr. Malinauskas to BNS on Tuesday.
So far, it is being considered to what extent and when it will be possible to apply the innovation.
