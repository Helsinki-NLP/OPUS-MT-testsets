You have to go get it.
Why are you at home?
He looks like my father.
Don't stop him.
I am new here.
I'm not about to stop.
We know what you're doing.
How's your father?
I know what they said.
Why don't we go somewhere together?
See you again.
Take a break.
I have no home to live in.
You'll make it.
I gave birth to my first child last year.
I'm sure I've seen him before somewhere.
You are a good person.
Where's your family?
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there.
I'm not hungry.
I'm a new student.
I've lost my keys.
We're not alone.
I want you to know that.
In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?
No one knew what to do.
This made me think of you.
I'm one of your students.
Why don't you study French?
It's not what you think.
I do want to see you.
I'm glad you are here.
When do you get up?
Does Tom know why?
Where is my watch?
We have no money.
Excuse me.
I don't need it.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other choice.
I know what I would do.
I know where she is.
It's very good.
The weather was not only cold, it was also damp.
I have lost my pencil.
When do you get up?
You can choose whichever color you like.
She spent all afternoon cooking.
They have no money.
You are a good mother.
Are you coming or not?
I want to cook for you.
Do you want to be rich?
I have a headache.
If you don't understand, ask.
This is my father.
That's what I want to know.
What don't I understand?
I do not think that he will come.
I don't understand it.
They say that he's very rich.
His speech was excellent.
I don't want to cook.
Don't do it again.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him well.
I have done it.
I don't think that he will come.
He is in love with her.
The sun rises in the east.
Why are you not doing it?
It's going to be great.
There are no problems.
I still remember the first time.
Do you want to take that?
What's her name again?
I'm sorry I said that.
My brother is not at home.
My parents call me up every day.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
Look at this photo.
I'm in the car.
What are you good at?
Is that your mom?
Why is the sky blue?
If you don't understand, ask.
This is our car.
No one here has a car.
Vote for us!
I don't know that word.
You know me.
I am glad you are here.
Are you looking for us?
Forget it!
What is this thing used for?
I'm not proud of this.
My daughter will get married in June.
I know those women.
I understand what you're saying.
That makes me happy.
How do you know my name?
Do you want it or not?
Is this love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are the twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I heard you got married.
Are you going or not?
She used to be a teacher.
I'm in love with her.
Goodbye!
What do you take me for?
I saw that, too.
You'll want to see this.
A promise is a debt.
She doesn't live with him.
I don't like those people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Without a doubt!
Nobody listens.
I thought that was your job.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
You aren't coming, are you?
Here he comes.
Give it to him.
I don't know how long.
Whose handbag is this?
May I come again?
Shut up!
Nobody knows what to do.
Don't look down.
I'll ask him.
We're back.
I'll be watching you.
I know things about you.
There is no problem.
I want to study French.
My car has broken down.
You know that I love you.
I know her.
Listen!
I know what I would do.
I know what's happening.
She's lost her car key.
Why aren't you with me?
May I see that again?
Can you tell a sheep from a goat?
You don't know my brother.
I'm taking you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Does that satisfy you?
May I come again?
That's why I like you.
Are you home?
It'll be hot.
Could I have the bill, please?
It is Monday.
It is too hot.
You know that I like you.
That bed is very comfortable.
Our trip is dependent on the weather.
I took the money.
What do you want to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you new?
I know what to do.
Do you like to study?
Do you have my money?
I don't know how.
I know how to do it.
Where're the shoes?
I'm glad you're here.
This is a very good book.
Thank you for stopping by.
I respect you.
I'm very sorry.
She's strong.
Here's $5.
I ran to my mother.
It's perfect.
Your trousers are dirty.
I'm watching you.
Thank you for stopping by.
Do you like studying?
I will give it to you.
Have a drink with me.
I want one, too.
You are my friend.
Where's our car?
No one knows what to do.
What school do you go to?
You don't want to know it!
He is a good student.
It made me think.
Take a book and read it.
I don't have a home.
Thanks a lot!
I know you said that.
I'm thinking about you.
He is happy.
I am hungry.
You do not know me.
Don't look at me like that.
I thought that you'd gone home.
My daughter will get married in June.
She was brought up by her grandmother.
I've given up on you.
I wanna go home.
They don't know about it.
I have an older brother.
I made that dress by myself.
How long do you want it for?
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
I've lost my glasses.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We understand.
I love that book.
Please read the text below.
You're the woman I love.
I will make you happy.
That's one of ours.
Where is your family?
Don't say that word again.
OK, I'll order it.
Where do we go?
I don't see how.
You know where I'll be.
What's the purpose of your trip?
We are happy to see you.
I know the girl.
Stop the car.
I don't see how.
Do you know what to do?
We know you.
No, thank you.
Where do you want to live?
I like where I live.
Don't ask.
Do I have to open the window?
Only a few drops of rain have fallen.
Where are you going?
You look very happy.
You have to go home.
Does she live here?
Are you learning French?
You'll be very sorry.
Come to visit me.
Where is my car?
I don't know how.
I saw my sister there.
I know what I'm doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I'm doing it for you.
That girl looks like a boy.
I don't have a brother.
It's a shame, my best friend is moving. He's going to live in another city.
Do they live with you?
You know that I have to go.
Here is your book.
It is not my day.
How long has she been sick?
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
Not only does she speak English, but also German.
I'm not in love with you.
I know what's going on.
I know you know this.
This is good, isn't it?
I know what you are thinking.
You've got a fever.
The skirt didn't fit so I had to alter it.
It would have been better if you had not gone there.
That girl looks boyish.
I love watching you cook.
I've got to fix my hair.
Is it too small?
It belongs to my brother.
I'm happy you're happy.
Would you have time to help me with something?
Give it to her.
I'm not good with names.
Do you know what love is?
The wedding will take place on Saturday.
If I don't eat, I will die.
Tell me about your plan.
Whose book is this on the desk?
I've lost my pencil.
Thanks for coming.
I'm a cook.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I cut class.
Take a good look at this.
Do you see it?
Are they looking at us?
Are you a good dancer?
After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath.
Is your mother here?
We came to see you.
They're children.
Come on, Tom. Don't be shy.
Don't forget to send the letter.
I know you like me.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
I go to school here, too.
I don't have a sister.
I cut my finger with a knife.
What are you looking at?
I'll make you happy.
Do you know where she is?
Where is your father?
Don't ask me again.
My father is home.
The skirt is too wide for me.
Are they Japanese?
Give me the book.
You're a good person.
These windows look to the south.
I forgot to buy bread.
I'll go on Sunday.

I understand it.
Turtles don't have teeth.
I'm not happy about it.
My dream has come true.
You can understand me.
I don't know what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I am not a student.
Let me see.
Are you home?
Be kind to those who hate you.
It isn't the same without you.
It's too small.
The elevator isn't working today.
We're very happy.
That girl is good-looking.
Come to visit me.
I'm not a very good carpenter.
You don't know me.
Tell them what happened.
I thought that you went home.
I did it for you.
I like your car.
Who's your teacher?
Are you going home?
Does that satisfy you?
That's enough.
Without a doubt!
Am I in love?
I don't know him.
I am glad you are here.
I need a hug.
I've given up on you.

What is he aiming at?
Listen to your mother!
I like math.
Here she comes.
We'll all go there together.
Until next week.
I love watching you cook.
What do you do?
I'm taking a break.
Are they coming, too?
You know we love you.
Can you tell a sheep from a goat?
I'll think about it.
Nobody listens to me.
I like to study French.
Maybe this weekend we could go to the beach together.
Why do they do it?
You are not coming, are you?
You must go home.
How old is he?
I know you.
I'm not going to stop.
He does not look happy.
I know what to look out for.
He goes to work on foot every day except on rainy days.
Thanks a lot!
I don't want to give up.
What's going on down there?
We're going to watch a play.
It looks good.
I'm reading a book.
Do you know whose is this car here?
I'm resting.
You are a good student.
Forget it.
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
Can you spare a minute?
I like short hair.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
The skirt is too wide for me.
Don't send me away.
Give it to her.
Get down.
Why do you think that?
I have sisters.
He cut a twig from the tree with his knife.
Is she coming, too?
He does not like us.
Hi!
It isn't good.
I have to learn French.
This'll be great.
You have my word on it.
Come in.
Everything has its limit.
I've had a busy morning.
That makes us happy.
Let's buy this one.
I'm not a good person.
I know what I'll do.
What do you want to know?
We know why you came here.
My grandmother speaks slowly.
I'll try it.
I like studying French.
She is pregnant.
If I had known, I would not have come.
What do you think this is?
Can I open the curtain?
What a day!
I know what I'd do.
I'm a student.
Listen to me.
Where's my money?
I saw you.
Are you home?
I know what you are thinking.
I want to talk to you.
I like what I see.
I know what you're thinking.
It depends on you.
I study French at home.
Is she your sister?
We are brothers.
They're not coming today.
Do the children go to school?
What're you looking for?
Where do you know each other from?
No one understands me.
I'm not giving this up.
Don't give me that look.
You take the money.
Why me?
I'll come back.
I'm sorry that I dragged you into this.
Vote for us!
This word comes from Greek.
The bus stopped, but nobody got off.
Do you love him?
That street is very noisy.
I kissed her on the cheek.
Say it in French.
Dogs often bury bones.
Is the glass half full or half empty?
Don't look at me that way.
Carry her to the operating room.
But more often than not, we came back empty-handed.
Where do you know him from?
Where do you want to go?
I have to stop.
It's still too early to talk about that.
She's a good person.
I'll make you happy.
I want to see you again.
Get on with it.
I really want to see you.
Don't you understand that?
You're my friend.
You're not listening.
Why are you home?
Are you looking for this?
These flowers you see are roses.
You're not good at this.
We could go together.
You know I like you.
This is how we cook rice.
You are not my brother.
You aren't coming, are you?
They're coming home.
I'm happy you're here.
I'm going to make it.
You used to smoke, didn't you?
You can choose whichever color you like.
It's not important.
Whose fault is that?
You're a good cook.
Whose fault is it?
Do you know what he said?
I felt ill.
Do you want to know how?
The price is going up.
My left arm is asleep.
This is my cat.
Smoking is harmful to health.
My father's car is new.
I came to say goodbye.
I can't hear it.
Don't ask me what that is.
You need a plan.
You understand me.
Do you want to stop?
I love my family.
I don't want to be here.
You are children.
I need time to think.
That's my car.
Close the window.
I don't understand French.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
That is what I want to know.
You make me happy.
I knew you'd be happy.
How annoying!
I knew it.
Are you looking for this?
I loved you.
I don't know your name.
I'm taking the day off.
Mind your head.
She has hundreds of books.
Don't listen to her.
That black one is mine.
What do you do?
We want complete sentences.
I still have some pain in my knee.
That book is of no use.
I don't want to see you.
She is a good student.
It's not necessary to write a long letter.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
You're a good student.
Where are the shoes?
This intersection is dangerous.
They are happy.
Do you want to come in?
He loves her.
Where's your father?
Read it once more.
I know that you're listening.
No one knows his name.
I'll be taking the car.
You're not my brother.
He works in a factory.
I'm sorry I said that.
Look there.
He's always losing his mobile.
I live here.
It's no use.
I know him.
Close the window.
The factory will begin to produce next year.
Prices went up.
I'm planning to read as many books as I can this year.
I don't feel comfortable here.
We are brother and sister.
The hand has five fingers: the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, the ring finger, and the pinky.
I saw your father.
What are you reading?
No one's home.
Where's my car?
The museum is closed on Mondays.
Do you have a car?
Why are they saying that?
I don't know how to cook.
Store in a cool and dry place.
How about Friday?
I'm glad you are here.
She is responsible for it.
"Whose glasses are these?" "They are my father's."
I know what I will do.
She is not there.
Stop staring at her breasts!
Whose bed is that?
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
I don't want to know about this.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
If he had had time, he would have gone.
Whoever wants to marry her must first convince her father.
She understands him.
I thought you knew.
They're very, very good.
How's the family?
You'll want to see this.
We've arrived.
Who is reading?
Why don't people like me?
I spend a lot of time practicing the guitar.
It's not what you think.
I'm sorry that I dragged you into this.
I'm hungry.
I'm not rich.
Why don't you listen?
Why do you have this?
Where's the car?
I must go now.
My car is broken.
We are home.
We're happy to see you.
How is your father?
I like mathematics.
He doesn't know me.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
I get off there, too.
My house is near the church.
I know how to use this.
Get me out of here.
Let me have a look.
She has lost her car key.
Are you a new student?
This makes me happy.
Why are we doing that?
I'm sorry for shouting at you.
I have no car.
You're not coming, are you?
He's happy.
I'm in trouble because of you.
Do you remember?
Run for it!
Nobody knew what to do.
I watched it on YouTube.
How are things?
I'm in trouble because of you.
I want you to see this.
May I take your order?
I don't like studying.
Nobody knows.
They want us to do it.
Do you live here?
Close all the windows.
I want to go home.
I had a busy morning.
I lost my glasses.
Some of the workers have no experience.
What do you do here?
They aren't happy.
Is it white?
Do whatever's required.
Don't you want to know why?
He looks like your brother.
I'm listening to you.
Why are you not with me?
I don't want your money.
What a day!
I know what I need to do.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
I have homework.
I knew you'd go there.
Don't do it again.
Let me go and buy some bread.
My daughter is to get married in June.
I know how to do it.
January is the first month of the year.
I'll come by 10.
I have to know.
Chocolate tastes sweet.
We'll see you there.
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
I want to live with you.
Languages have hard words.
There was a church here once.
We miss you, too.
Who do you think I am?
Why don't you want to go?
Don't you want to know what happened?
Why do you think so?
Why don't you try this jacket on? It looks nice with your trousers.
My sister resembles my mother.
You may go there.
I wanna see you.
I'm not proud of it.
Why don't you do it?
Do you have a brother?
He isn't a child.
I don't have books to read.
We play on Sunday.
I always hand wash my bras.
Whose house is this?
Why aren't you in school?
I think it's OK.
I don't know where to go.
I have a fever.
We study French.
I want to see you.
How long do you want it for?
He's similar to his father.
No one knows her name.
The window is closed.
Don't come again.
This is a great book.
This book is very good.
Go to bed!
That bed is very comfortable.
I still don't know yet.
Sleep well, Timmy.
You aren't listening.
You have to stop drinking.
Speak with me.
I couldn't control my tears.
She shaved her head.
I don't know.
She picked the most expensive dress.
I know him only by name.
He looks like your brother.
Stop looking at me.
This doesn't look like yours.
I'm taking you with me.
Is everything arranged for the trip?
I think it's fine.
I'm not an idiot.
I'm only here because of you.
A student wants to see you.
What shall I put on: trousers or a skirt?
I am a new student.
He walked slowly so the child could follow.
The room's nice.
I'm not going to stop.
I was wondering if you'd let me stay with you for a few days.
I am a university student.
We're going west.
I thought it would make you laugh.
How are things at home?
I love coming here.
Are there two windows in your room?
I started working for this company last year.
That's too long.
I'll understand.
Why do you have this?
She did not read the book.
I live in Norway now.
I slept all day yesterday, because it was Sunday.
Where is your brother?
I came here to study.
I cannot rinse the dishes. There is no water.
I'm taking a break.
Does she know that you like her?
I'm a baker.
This is my new car.
Get out of the car.
Watch how I do it.
I'm in the kitchen.
I want to know your name.
Do you like it?
I know what's up.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
Don't drink that.
We're out of money.
How is the family?
Where do you study?
I love what I do.
We don't have a car.
Say that again.
I'll make you happy.
I like living here.
What do you look like?
He has a car.
Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
Don't make me do this.
I have to see you.
Don't ask for money.
I know what they're doing.
Do you know how that looks?
I'm happy you're here.
I don't care where you're eating dinner.
You are children.
They don't make you happy.
The bus stop is five minutes' walk from here.
I think I've got it.
You are a good cook.
Let me give you a hug.
What are your wishes?
Why are you asking me?
Where's my watch?
Have a drink with me.
I saw him running.
Good question.
I like to read.
That girl looks like a boy.
I like you.
She picked out the most expensive dress.
Take off your shoes.
We don't know it.
She likes him.
He's a good person.
I'm happy with that.
Where is Mary?
Why are you asking me?
It's a good plan.
I will make you happy.
He doesn't look happy.
I'm very sorry.
Do you understand it?
You are my friend.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He is not a child.
Why are you going there?
I thought you'd gone home.
The factory produces thousands of bottles every month.
It's very hot here.
I don't know those people.
You'll like him.
You're not coming, are you?
I'm washing the windows.
Why do I have to go?
OK, I'll order it.
I knew you'd like it.
Let me buy you a new one.
Go away!
You are one of us.
Is it too big?
She loves him.
He likes to read books.
Why don't you come in?
I don't know how long.
Don't you know what it is?
Why not come with me?
Why are you asking?
Take whatever you want.
You'll love it.
He doesn't speak English.
The car broke down.
This wall is cold.
Why do you think so?
No one knows their name.
Take me with you.
Where's your father?
I'm going to bed.
Can I use this?
Is it too big?
Did you see their faces?
Do you know her?
She isn't paid monthly, but daily.
Good. And you?
I am Chinese.
This car is my father's.
Thank you!
She looks like her mother.
We know her.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
I go to school here, too.
I'm coming to get you.
Yesterday was Friday.
Here she is!
We don't understand French.
We don't want to know.
I have money for you.
My stomach hurts.
Don't come again.
I get what you're saying.
I know why you want it.
I think he'll come.
Is Tom there, too?
Isn't this great?
No, thanks.
What do you think?
She's not a child.
No one knows where we are.
You may not like it.
It's ours.
He doesn't love us.
That'll be great.
He's a Frenchman.
You ran a red light.
Do you want me to come?
I knew you'd be here.
Stop reading.
They say that he is very rich.
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
How are you today?
Your forehead is quite hot. I think you have a fever.
She understands him.
Are you students?
Good night!
I don't know where they are.
Why don't you go home?
I think I sat on it.
I thought that you knew.
My house is near the church.
I do not have a sister.
We don't really have to talk about this right now, do we?
I know that.
I don't want the money.
Where's the cook?
You can spend the night at our place.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
This car is like new.
When do you study?
These windows look to the south.
Don't give up!
Me, too.
Why aren't you at school?
Whose is this phone?
Whose phone is this?
We know that.
My father is at home.
I don't know what you want.
Take one of these.
Where is his family?
Whose idea was this?
I'm on my break.
You're sick. You have to rest.
I ran out of money.
Bananas are yellow.
There was no one there besides me.
I've said I'm sorry.
I know what I'm saying.
I thought that you'd understand.
The exact same thing happened to my friend a week later!
Take me home.
I'll go get it.
See you on Monday.
She is in love with him.
Where's your brother?
You are not coming, are you?
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
You don't look that good.
Is that why you came here?
You'll like her.
I saw him.
That's what I'm looking for.
Come here!
I'm not a good person.
I am washing the windows.
I don't look like that.
My father isn't at home.
Don't do it again.
Do you like it?
He is not there.
The boy is jumping.
Classes are over.
I would do it again.
The money is gone.
We're students.
I saw it coming.
I have to take a break.
I think so, too.
I'll take you with me.
I'm in love with her.
Why so much hate?
I've read this book.
I'm coming to get you.
I think I got it.
Do you know what to do?
Give it to him.
They're very, very good.
I think I understood.
Take off your shoes.
I know that you like me.
You are not my brother.
I'll take a look at it.
Today is Sunday.
I know it.
I'm going to take off.
This flag is very beautiful.
Welcome to our home!
We're going to be rich.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
How is it going?
I'll do what you ask.
It's too long.
Let me have a look at it.
Many thanks.
I need time to think.
I knew you'd be happy.
It is the same book as the one I have.
What're you reading?
I speak three languages.
Where do you live?
I cut my finger with a knife.
We don't know him.
Don't come back.
What do you know?
Shall we begin now?
He doesn't like us.
She likes to read books.
Take a good look at this.
I don't need it.
Is there a washing machine in the house?
God bless you!
I know where you live.
How long will you stay?
Have a good look at this picture.
What's your take on this?
I love math.
My neighbor is a carpenter.
Many trees fell down.
Do you like it?
Step aside.
Investigate the cause of it.
I take it.
That's how it is.
Get it out of here.
The patient fainted at the sight of blood.
Do you know what they want?
What do you want to watch?
I'll give you a book.
Where is he playing?
I like you, too.
Not now, then when?
I don't know where you live.
Why don't you get one?
Open the window.
Don't forget to ask follow-up questions.
It's a quarter to three.
We got separated.
I know that you're listening.
That's why I love you.
What do you know about what happened?
They'll know what to do.
We're finally alone.
Do you know where they are?
We know it.
I know how to get there.
What happened to your car?
All cats are grey in the dark.
This book is new.
There is no water left in the bottle.
I sell clothing online.
It's very hot, isn't it?
I know what I need to do.
There she is!
I'm thinking of you.
Can you remember this game?
She's happy.
We're out of money.
I don't know what I want.
Thank you!
Today is Wednesday.
Do you know this?
Ask him his name.
They don't want to use it.
My dream came true.
Where do you come from?
I know you're listening.
Watch where you're going.
Don't forget to post the letter.
He understands French.
I love her.
Please read the text below.
I'm not a student.
This knife is dull.
I am listening to you.
I think I still have time for another cup of coffee.
We love our parks.
Why do you love me?
Don't look at it.
I want you to read it.
Watch where you're going.
I thought you would understand.
I am not proud of this.
This word comes from Greek.
It's my brother's.
Why do I have to do it?
Why aren't you here?
Is it broken?
I know what I have to do.
Don't forget to send the letter.
You don't want to know it!
I know your mother.
I don't know that word.
I get what I want.
The dress is made of silk.
Please give me a hug.
Where is my money?
Why are you asking this?
Is there something you want to get off your chest? Come on, you can tell me.
Thank you very much.
That girl looks boyish.
I came looking for you.
I'm not home on Sundays.
Do good to those who hate you.
That word is of Greek origin.
Whose idea was it?
Take a number.
My name is John.
Do you know what it says?
I have sisters.
Do you know whose car this is?
I'm not going to stop.
He's now studying.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
It is Saturday.
I need three volunteers.
He ran out of money.
It's not about money.
We do not know him.
Don't give up on me.
You can speak English.
Get out of my bed.
I get it.
I have to stop.
My mother loves me.
I don't want to be rich.
I have money.
My trousers are wet.
Whose beer is this?
I know these people.
I don't have a home.
We broke up.
They aren't coming today.
What do you want from us?
What?
I have to study French.
How's your sister?
I don't want to get sick.
He's very happy with the new bike.
Does goodness charm more than beauty?
Don't you understand that?
I've come to say goodbye.
