High - performance tires are designed for use at higher speeds, and more often, a more "Sporty" driving style.
However, in reasonable amounts of mud and snow, tires should be thinner.
However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet.
However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on the bead.
Hydroplaning, also known as aquaplaning, is the condition where a layer of water builds up between the tire and road surface.
Hydroplaning is more prevalent with wider tires and at higher speeds.
Hydroplaning occurs when the tread pattern cannot channel away enough water at an adequate rate to ensure a semi - dry footprint area.
