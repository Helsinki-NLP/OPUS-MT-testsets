This subject is outside the scope of our inquiry.
You're in my seat.
You are quite right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You've got to be careful.
I think we're going to need Tom's help.

Do you have any other questions?
It was terribly cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I majored in American literature at college.

We were worried sick.
I think you'll be pleased.
The teenagers left.

I've only just begun.
If you need anything, just call.
Don't forget that it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I learned quite a bit.
She bought a toy for the kid.

I bet you know French.
Tom took Mary to a beachfront restaurant for dinner.
You don't have to pay for an apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
It doesn't matter how old you get, you can learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
Are there kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy hearing you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think that all our politicians are too old?

I enjoy taking pictures.
I'll pay you back.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You should keep your promise.

My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh! That's too bad.
The bus arrived empty.
We should continue helping Tom.
My mother has good handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned up his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, not because she's beautiful, but because she's kind to everyone.

It's true!
We are grateful to you for your help.
Ever since we've been wearing clothes, we haven't known one another.
Let's start.

I've found the key.
I know that this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It is delicious.
You have many caring friends.
I don't have any pencils.
I really don't know Tom that well.
I'll tell you the truth now.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He has been living here these ten years.
I have socks, but I have no shoes.
Damn.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
The sense of humor is mysteriously bound up with national characteristics.

That book on kabuki might be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this book yours?
I've always wanted to study French.
Are you going to call Tom or do you want me to?
Don't let Tom scare you.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum salary in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom that he's being obnoxious.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I make a bargain with him over the price.
You can speak French, can't you?
My father seldom smokes.
His vain efforts to seduce her showed he was barking up the wrong tree; she was a mother of two tots.
I lost it.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change a thing.
I have an appointment with him at noon.
The invitation said that popcorn and soft drinks would be served.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What have you discovered?
I think we should get out here.

Where's the entrance?
Tom tried to elicit a response from Mary.
A young boy, who couldn't have been more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.

The door clicked shut.
I'm hungry!
Tom is easy to talk to.
The twin brothers look exactly alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get his joke.
I bet you know this.
It is cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Could you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was ill.
I have some very bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit I'm a little anxious.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you're right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to attend Mary's party.
You won't be the only one there.
I heard what was said.
The story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
This is Tom's handiwork.
You wouldn't believe the stuff people throw away.
I gave up smoking for a year.
Don't carry too much baggage when you travel.
I have Tom's picture right here.
I haven't told you everything.
They both work.
Tom isn't welcome here.
He accused her of having lied to him.
There is no point in deluding yourself; you know it well that she's just playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was amusing.
He gave his camera to his friend.

I swim once a week.
I waited for an hour and a half.
He made fun of me in public.
The light bulb burned out.

This is incredible.
Where is the bus terminal?
Tom wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all took it for granted that Tom could speak French.
Tom went back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I would like some information about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You wouldn't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel good.
Why did you come early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night owl.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do what you want, but I'll stop it, if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I am going to learn to swim over the holiday.
Which way is the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I have a feeling he's not going to let me off the hook that easily.
It will be 5:30 presently.
School begins at eight-thirty.
Tom is taking a bath.
The beach isn't far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug from you would make me happy.
When will you leave?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There is a really good restaurant just off the beach that I think you'd enjoy.
What made you think so?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
There was nothing for it but to wait for her.

I have nothing.
Use your head for a change.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I think about that from time to time.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you answer?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I have finally won his heart.
We had to yield to their request.
Choose the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so you should go to bed early.
That was just plain stupid.
We'll soon be together.
I have nothing to offer.
I speak French to my staff.
That's a photo of my sister.
Tom has trouble dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her a piece of advice.
The room was so full of smoke that I could hardly breathe.

It looks like she is a little under the weather.

Go away!

You're kidding!
Let's come back.

At that shop they deal in kitchen utensils.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You are expected to do a good job.
How old's your son?
The girl who works at that bakery is cute.
Please give me another cup of coffee.
Alice may possibly come.
How do you do it?
That was a good time.
I'll stay until the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
I'm not at fault.

I've never seen one like that.
Come as soon as you can.

Do it now.

I think you should quit.
Please have patience.

Clearly you are mistaken.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom is at his desk writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll get back to you about Tom.
I opened a checking account.
He was here at that time.
I put on my shoes at once.
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom can't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you study French every day?
Don't be so noisy, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one conceived his words to be important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't get this.
OK, what kind of place do you live at?

It's time to eat lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got an A.
I made this for you.
I've seen you someplace.

I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says that he is able to communicate with the dead.

I hope I get a chance to return the favor you've done me.
Tom looked through the drawer to see if there was a pen he could use.
That requires careful consideration.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to find out the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.

I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I were young.
Be more precise.
Tom's French is really quite good.
Isn't this weather just great!

I will be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained the matter in detail.
Don't let Tom get away.
He was playing football with an empty can.

I am on holiday this week.
My French teacher is the same age as me.
You'd better wear a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom to help?

What shoes fit well?
We definitely worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmer.
He began to make excuses.
How old are you?
It's OK.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How old are your children?
I will stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!

I haven't started yet.
About how much would a taxi be from here?
You both seem very young.
You are absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I have few English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
He enthusiastically engaged himself in this honorable undertaking.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a slump.
I think you should come and see it.
Tom doesn't speak French as fluently as Mary.
Be more precise.
I am on holiday this week.
I wash my socks.
I promise I won't do this again.
I just gave blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I have no doubt as to his sincerity.
Please open the package.
The drink is on me.
I have no idea who he is.
May I have your name, please?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Did you watch the game?
It's your home.
Losses were heavy on both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time to leave.

This cake is good.
I told Tom the reason why I wouldn't be able to go.
Long skirts are out of fashion now.
He is good at dealing with children.
Please come in.
We really enjoyed ourselves.
Tom hates it.
It's true that she's dead.
Don't make it a habit.
It has finally stopped snowing and has warmed up.
She's been dropping some not-so-subtle hints about what she would like for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take your socks off?
Let's go to a movie.
It looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom isn't giving up.
Certain poisons, properly used, are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it to yourself.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm angry with you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mum! Can you pass me the toilet paper?
How did it go?
I think you'll find it.
I was expecting you last night.
It looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom gave Mary advice on effective ways to study French.
I'm bad at sports.
The judge condemned him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found him a genius at chemistry.
You can't just walk around and start slandering people.
I had an appointment at 2:30, but I got caught in traffic and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the maritime museum.
Tom is working hard to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted.
They didn't speak.
I didn't call you stupid.
I feel like speaking French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not so bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it so hard.
We're all related.
A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It's been completed.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Tom won't be getting any help from Mary.
You won't be safe anywhere.
She was wearing a fur coat.
I promise I won't do this again.
I made Ann a doll.
What's your major, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read that book.
You've had a good year.
It's been cleaned.
I can't do this.

I want to buy a gift for Tom.
One thing's for sure: nobody can stop me!
She can speak French.
He is a friendly person.
I was convicted.
Tom was told he had cancer just recently.
Tom came home by bus.
An afternoon appointment is more convenient for me.
What's on your plate?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What is that?
It was just too easy.
I often travel.
Here is the hospital where I was born.
I never liked biology.
I'm very much obliged to you for your kindness.
Let's split the reward fifty-fifty.
Shake my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I have to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom threw a big party at his house while his parents were away on vacation.
I was compelled to leave school.
I've just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the one who told me when the meeting would be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began returning home.
I'm in trouble. I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.

I think you're perfect.
A human being is part of the whole, called by us Universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

I'm not so tired.
You have a gum infection.
He's started writing a novel.
He is satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can still catch your train.
You won't be needing that again.
Put it back where you got it from.
Let's start!
I tricked you.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
You managed it after all.
Can you do it alone?
She blushed.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom is always smiling.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary is attractive?
What's the minimum salary in India?
Don't make this decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You're in my seat.
When did Tom pass away?
These two shirts are made from the same material.
Do you study French?
You shouldn't quit English.
It was unjust.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in days.
What is Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He himself did it.
We'll be starting college next year.
Which did you eat, fish or meat?
I opened a checking account.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why is Tom not here?
What's Ken doing now?
There are many sentences about DNA, but none about RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thanks for pointing this out.
Don't pick your nose.
The wind blew in gusts.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her older daughter is married.
Tom is better at speaking French than any of his classmates.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
I have work on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
Japanese people tend to rely on established authority.
I returned home by train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what kind of situations would you do that?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it once more.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and want to go to bed early.
Tom speaks very good French.
I am not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal.
I bet I get there before you.
He was painted like a clown.
I feel ill at ease in her company.
She bought him a dog. However, he was allergic to dogs, so they had to give it away.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the museum by cab.
Mind your own business!
He has written a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
There are holes in the heels of these socks.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't say that word again.
I observed him stop.
She felt her knees tremble.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I will meet him some other time.
It wasn't that loud.
What a strong wind!
It's my CD, isn't it?
I've told you not to call me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He hangs around with the wrong group of kids.
It's better for you to keep out of private affairs.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed whenever I floss my teeth.
We made good time since the traffic was light.
You've got to be careful.
What don't you have?
He has recently returned from France.
Molly has a large clock.
Tom isn't helping me.
I haven't got in touch with him for a long time.
Those glasses suit you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat till the numbness wears off.
I would never lie to you.
Kate keeps a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do this again.
Tom won't be helping us tomorrow.
His friend is an ex-Senator.
Is French more difficult than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Are you scared of something?
I have two cousins.
Leaves fall in the autumn.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
How long has Tom been studying French?
He was completely fagged out.
Thanks for coming!
Hi. I feel kind of sick.
I'm so ashamed.
It looks like there are now over two thousand Uyghur sentences on Tatoeba!
Tom is persevering.
We can't postpone the meeting.
I am ashamed of having done so.
Let's cross here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, just ask.
You were always a little strange.
Are you going to go to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary got arrested?
If mankind doesn't take care of the environment, the environment may eliminate mankind.
No, thank you. I am just looking.
I felt like an outcast among those people.
I think you're going to enjoy yourself tonight.
Don't put that away yet.
Excuse me for interrupting you.
Being overly generous is his greatest fault.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always behaved like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yes, I know it.
I wonder what Tom meant by that.
This costs nothing.
I don't mind hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers wilt without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I have forgotten.
Check, please.
Does that price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
There's no more salt.
She forgot to feed her dog.
The problem isn't that.
Go and meet him, and while you're about it mail this letter.
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs recently.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Have I disappointed you?
Bear with me.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He is very glad that his school life is going well.
Mrs. Young didn't mind my dropping in on her unexpectedly.
You have beautiful lips.
Many people will lose their jobs due to the slump in the auto industry.
He came to my rescue.
We're going to begin the descent for Honolulu.

Hanshin's moment of glory didn't last. They fell out of first place in a hurry.
Does he have a big house?
Wouldn't that cause problems?
He resented being called a coward.
They're getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail the examination?
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions did they come to?
Well, here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could've been lying.
I feel fine.
She pressed the switch.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want. I just haven't found it yet.
I have to get moving.
He is a famous composer.
Tom put the pie on the kitchen windowsill to cool.
Happy is a man who marries a good wife.
Tom gave me good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live this way anymore.
What a pity it is!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard about what happened.
Certainly she is correct.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the globe into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Aren't you intrigued?
We derive a great deal of pleasure from watching baseball games.
I think you'd better rest for a while.
When did you begin learning French?
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror.
I've already finished my work.
It hasn't been easy.
Do you think it'll rain today?
You are very brave.
There is a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them away?
How does Tom plan to cope with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
It is the photo of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than you.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please pardon me for coming late.
I felt isolated.
I'm quite busy.
They're rather important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Try on this sweater.
I'd rather stay at home.
This isn't much fun.
A telephone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them the other day, but I was not able to get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We must protect our children.
See you around.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just being realistic.
I heard you cheering.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
During summer, I'm going to go to France.
Please shuffle the cards carefully.
Get on the bus bound for Badstraße, and get off at Seestraße.
Laughing is good for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I assume you're the Tom everybody's been telling me about.
Bookmark this site.
When the sun of culture hangs low, even dwarfs will cast long shadows.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on the bench.
We've just cleaned the toilets.
I have to go meet Tom at the mall.
I won't be intimidated.
You're in better shape than I am.
Are you ticklish?
I hope it's useful.
He himself tried it.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He stayed up late.
Tom is getting better.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Be careful where you step.
May I borrow your knife?
You are supposed to hand in the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd said that before.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary weren't speaking French.
I did it once.
He disregarded my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was going to cry.
She is her friend.
His clothes always smell bad.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I cannot even boil water, much less roast a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Are you free this evening?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
We hardly had time to eat our dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Give it back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I'd like an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom can speak French like a native.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I have no problem with that.
Where is the ticket office?
I'm really quite busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're going to need this.
I hate flying.
What other options are there?
Get me a drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a bit carried away when I was dancing and got up on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have? How many sisters do you have?
I think you'd remember that.
Please change this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and relax for a week.
I am thirsty.
The bus jolted over the rough road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is howling.
She passed the exam.
Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I have met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom isn't in trouble.
I made several mistakes in the exam.
This book doesn't belong to Tom.
Where was that?
I have to take it off.
Can I do anything to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom is a grown man now.
Let's face reality.
I've gotten better.
That is not art. That is a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Take one of these.
You're so helpful.
Have you heard from him?
She gave the blouse a quick wash.
Is there someone with you?
The museum is open to the public.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather is very fond of reading.
Did you know that you were wearing odd socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy dear.
Tom had one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary on Friday night and with Alice on Saturday night.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
She bought some paper that she could use for writing letters.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I don't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He got out from under the car.
He writes to his mother every now and then.
The men are getting into shape riding bicycles.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom got on the wrong bus.
Let's take a little rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you try.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim is short for James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bicycle belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom is alone?
You'll never be alone.
Does French have a similar expression?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Ann is a little girl.
Just keep your fingers crossed.
I walked toward the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes behind time.
She lives in rural seclusion.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You are my best friend.
I've set up a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just plain stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid for the video in five installments.
All I want to do is hang out with you guys.
She turned eighty-one.
I heard him go out.
I have a stomachache, doctor.
You don't understand.
What can be the meaning of this?
They come from Sweden.
Be alert when you cross a busy street!
A man must work.
That is intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come downstairs.
Mary ran.
They are longing for city life.
I am glad that you have succeeded.
The dog is walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running with a letter from Judy.
I heard that Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary talking about it.
Let's have sushi.
Throw away these socks, please.
Please take more care in the future.
Tom had a panic attack.
May I open a can?
Bill is a baseball player.
Don't say things like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom traveled first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I am taking tomorrow off.
I didn't say that either.
It is better to give than to take.
Could you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Could you solve the problem?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me that before.
It is six years since I started to study English.
I can't buy you that dress.
Work like a bee.
Brian kept Kate waiting.
I forbid you to smoke.
I've noticed that Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Would you please help me translate this?
Tom can hardly speak French at all.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom isn't so smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl looked very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner consumes a lot of electricity.
Don't swallow that slick propaganda.
Tom believes that the death penalty should be abolished.
First the good God made Man, then He made Woman. After this, He took pity on Man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Boys, don't make any noise.
Don't make eye contact.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does this look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
How much money do you have?
That won't change anything.
This building is near completion.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get back to work.
Aoi dances.
Machines can do a lot of things for people today.
He's out taking a walk.
Please begin immediately.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom has flat feet.
Keep digging.
Where is the museum?
"Human stupidity is endless", I say, and for this self-criticism, I consider myself an exception.
Far from stopping, the storm became much more intense.
Tom had Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't be at the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The road is uphill all the way.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things could get back to normal.
Show me.
Tom had a tooth pulled out last week.
The more you run the tired you become.
Don't conceal what you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl is Irish.
This is going to be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom often gets sick.
This key won't go in the lock.
What's the minimum salary in Italy?
Tom turned the light back on.
This bicycle is mine.
I'm not used to spicy food.
Choose whichever you like.
Go there and talk to her.
We met at summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out that I've been going out with Nimrod Nick, he got very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom passed away yesterday.
I thought we would have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She pulled her sweater on.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry Mr. President: with gums that bad, I doubt she even HAS teeth.
I haven't seen you in here before.
I think Tom is going to die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Just go back to bed.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes suit you.
They made straight for their destination.
The boy got in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The check, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Have you finished dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do whatever you think is right.
Are you falling for Tom?
Persistence pays off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking in French is fun.
Tom won't be successful.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe that an alien intelligence is watching the Earth.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been some mistake.
My father is taking a walk in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't rush me. I'm thinking.
I think you should grow a beard.
Do you like French?
It looks like we're being ignored.
What's going on?
Are you sure you don't want another soda?
A lot of people feel the same way about this as I do.
The blouse is clean.
I'd like some tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He accomplished the great undertaking at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
A child is not a vessel for filling, but a fire to light.
I think you'd better look at this.
Can't you speak French?
Put the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much more fluently than I can.
I'll hide in here.
She attended on her sick husband.
He whistled as he walked.
I glimpsed the girl among the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, much less German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated from Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and held it open for Mary.
We make milk into cheese and butter.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
I haven't really thought about it.
I am on holiday this week.
If a sick person folds one thousand paper cranes, her wish will come true.
I'm surprised that building is still standing.
I don't owe you squat!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you quit?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Look through these papers.
I'd like to get this translated into French. Could you help me?
He didn't say a word.
They are having tea in the living room.
Tom started the engine.
What the hell's wrong with you?
He seems to have been a great athlete.
Give me some milk, too.
Cook 300 grams of rice.
Isn't it enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bicycle is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who drew it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We are boys.
Bad weather prevented us from departing.
I'm studying French now.
Not knowing where to get off the bus, I asked the driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I have my hands full.
How did you learn French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a roll.
I don't hold that against you.
The spread of television has considerably deprived us of our time for reading.
I'd need a whole eternity to explain everything.
Don't look in my closet.
The new coronavirus is very infectious.
Every time I call on you, you're out.
The next station is where you get off.
Wait a moment.
I'm here unofficially.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here until 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a piece of toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He majors in English literature.
The knife is dull.
She gave me a meaningful look.
It is forbidden to smoke on school premises.
I'm really tired and want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come this early?
Some people are good talkers and others good listeners.
I didn't catch the last word.
For all her riches, she's not happy.
You should go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You might meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone come in.
Tom followed in his father's footsteps.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom spoke to me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many distinctive traits.
Do you believe in God?
In the evening, I walk with my dog.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned down.
I should never have let you do that by yourself.
Condemned to death.
I've only been waiting for five minutes.
Would you please show me your photo album?
Tom's house burned down.
It is the greatest happiness in life to love and to be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm atheist.
Never write the words "bortsch" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees buckled.
I'll walk you back to your hotel.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she is over forty years old.
Do you have your driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He is in front of the door.
My business is picking up again.
The keys are on the table.
I walked toward the park.
He reported his accident to the police.
I don't see it.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid a promotion is out of the question now.
You were always a little strange.
Aren't you scared?
I haven't talked to anyone but Tom today.
I can hardly hear you.
You shouldn't go out.
Could you turn off the lights?
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed that he's not here.
You are wearing your socks inside out.
We have just received an inquiry from Kansas concerning your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model available on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's it really about?
Be careful of Tom.
We can't live on 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket for nothing.
Many people think that antique cars are overpriced.
The third quarter GNP growth was 1% over the preceding quarter.
Sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything at all there?
Everybody was at work.
I've run out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where is your father?
I'll do it the way you've told me to do it.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on the same bus with me.
I've waited for a month.
I've got to go meet Tom.
He was compelled to sign the contract.
It is not his illness that ruined him so much as his idleness.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
Allah is great!
I just feel awful.
She's very different at the end of the film.
Are you sure you don't want to study at my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog is also watching TV.
Let's work.
Are you sure you don't want to join me?
I'm not a lunatic.
He sometimes watches TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
This is pretty extreme.
Hurry up! There's only 30 minutes left before the train leaves.
The contestants are gearing up for the final round of competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
I'm kind of tired.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Coming here was a mistake.
Cut us some slack.
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'd like it there.
I'll be all right.
Tom won't be able to understand any of this.
Don't forget to bring kitchen utensils such as knives and cooking pots.
We've arrived.
Where are you going?
We're heading for the beach. Would you like to come with us?
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'll like this.
I could make you happy.
Each student has a locker.
Have you ever seen a koala?
Tom couldn't believe that Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He's out taking a walk.
You'd better be right.
No less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My holiday plan has fallen through.
I haven't seen you in days.
He came up to Tokyo, and there married her.
I don't think it's true.
I lost track of time.
He thought maybe this was a trick.
Basho was the greatest poet.
What is your problem?
I'm visiting my grandmother in the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anybody.

Where's the restroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
He postponed the party.
Mary said that Tom is her cousin.
They caught five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Put the car into the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do?
I saw him scolded by his father.
Keep your room neat and tidy.
I had a rough night.
She disliked her husband.
I studied his face for signs of weariness.

I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Bookmark this site.

You really do speak French quite well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's happening.
Am I clear?
Many parents are worried their children are not being given a basic understanding of numbers.
I majored in philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You could always hand off some of the work to the junior staff.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.

That place is worth visiting at least once.
He continued reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like this color.
Just deal with it.
She had her blouse ironed by her sister.
I've told you that before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's ample time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like orange juice.

Do not open those windows.
I don't have insurance.
I borrow money.
She is preparing for college.

In the vacation, I read the entire works of Milton.
What do you recommend to me?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I will meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell this?
I'm really concerned about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to my defense.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French. Mary can't speak French either.
I met her in London for the first time.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as being small.
Tom isn't accustomed to city life.
He kept his promise.
I forgot about it.
I think you're putting in too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll drive you home.
Man is the only fire-using animal.
All the flowers in the garden withered.
They made us work all day.
We elected him chairman.
No kidding?

If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What's the minimum salary in Luxembourg?
His doom is sealed.
Are these candles?
If you had to choose between piano and violin, which would you prefer ?
The answer is right.
I think this is perfect.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful you don't break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
It is an endangered species.
I think you'd better lie down.
I like you very much.

Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
How hungry are you?
This guy's tough.
I almost won.
It was not my mistake.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom is my friend.
You're going about it in the wrong way.
Something is happening.
Fill it up.
We have only a slender chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw that one away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved considerably compared with what it was.
I tricked you.
His joke was great.
The police are going to investigate the crime.
The stories which you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems which face young people.
So, we finally meet! I've waited so long for this moment.
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should look into it.
We're all agreed then.
If time permits, I'll visit the museum.
That tie really suits you.
I think you would make a great father.
There's no way to get in touch with him.
Never give up. Never surrender.
Could you show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You wouldn't believe me.
Can you come at nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I do the shopping every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do it.
Is this a duty-free shop?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
You wouldn't be any happier if I told you.
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Be careful that you don't get lost.
I'm tired of altering my plans every time you change your mind.
Seen from a distance, it looks like a man.
We worked hard to make ends meet.
Good morning!
John's grandmother passed away after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She will not budge an inch no matter what anyone says.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was granted an appeal.
Let's not jump the gun.

They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You must not jump to conclusions.
Don't worry.
He threw in the towel.
Wine is the milk of old men.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he gets to his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I have nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found that Mary had disappeared.
I've seen these pictures.
I am as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a taxi?
I hope I'm not late.
I returned home by train.
Why are you always so evil?
Alas!
Is this the reason you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy sound asleep.
She called him bad names.
Do we have it in us?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We deliberated whether we should cancel the reservation.
The children thought that their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were numb with cold.
Dogs are permitted.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
I had to decline the invitation because I was ill.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep going straight.
It is challenging and I am learning a lot.
Tom was all worn out.
I called on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
This is one of the fish that Tom caught.
Okay, let's go.
There's a car coming.
It looks like we'll get there in time.
Trolling is a art.
I've ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man is eating bread.
He swam across the river.
You don't remember, I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please send my regards to your family.
When an average person sends a message in a bottle, it's just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sends a message in a bottle, the fate of an entire country is at stake.
Are you sure you don't want to help me out?
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.
The kids are playing dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I've tried to be reasonable.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you for your cooperation in advance.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
She kept getting better.
Does Tom really want me to come to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I've waited as long as possible.
He rushed into the room with his coat on.
I went shopping last Saturday.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
His work shows nothing to brag about.
We don't see things as they are, but as we are.
She gave the door a gentle push.
Come whenever it is convenient to you.
Alexander wrote some sentences in Berber.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
It was the first time that I visited the museum.
Is she staying at a hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Tom and Mary walked down the stairs together.
You are early.
Want to leave at the last minute?

I'll never forget your kindness.
There's no toilet paper.
You're in my seat.
I can't speak French as well as Tom can.
She got good grades in English.
What do you want?
Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died.
I hope that John comes.
I'm going to open the wine and let it breathe.
I'm getting better.
Your education is important.
Tom stole your bike.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
It's happening.
Is it something I said?
After you get to the traffic lights, turn right.
I think you've done this before.
The press is not allowed inside.
It wasn't on sale.
Where is the toilet?
Everybody was singing except me.
My uncle gave me a present.
We arrived there before noon.
Aren't you married?
He crossed the Pacific Ocean in thirty days.
Tom always sleeps hugging his teddy bear.
