They say love is blind.
Please listen to me carefully.
Take a book and read it.
I have a dream.
Nobody understands me.
Why would you marry a woman if you like men?
Stay here with us.
Would you like something to drink?
I don't eat bread every day.
Eat!
I want to buy a gift for you.
Why did you do that?

My mouth was dry.
Hungry?
What do you want?
Good.
Do you love your father?
What would the world be without women?
This path is dangerous.
You are Simon, son of John.
If you don't eat, you die.
Someone was calling my name.
I know that already.
Why?
These things aren't mine!
No I'm not; you are!
Good night.
I love you both.
That won't happen.

Why don't you come visit us?
Come!
No one is there.
Leave!
Stop!
Hungry?

I am not acquainted with him.
I have two daughters.
Run!
He asked about the others.
Tom died that day.
The wind calmed down.
Read!
I'll ask my father to give me some money.
If I'd had the money, I would've bought that.
Come!
I already told you.
You should sleep.
Eat that bread!
You're an angel!
I will give it to you.
Where do you come from?
I think Tom is from Australia.
That's a good idea!
Eat that bread!
We're buying.
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
I have sinned.
I love you.
How do you spell "pretty"?
I was in the mountains.
I have two brothers.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Yes.
Fool!
Tom is the love of my life.
I tore up all the letters that you wrote to me.
When she entered the room, he stood up.
I'll take him.
Run!
Follow me.
I have two flowers.
Who searches, finds.
I will write about it.

I have two sons.
Tom's dog bit me.
I have to go to sleep.
I have brothers.
Where're you going?
Do you still need me?
Enter!
Eat fruits!
You don't know who I am.
We wanted to help them.
Perfect!
Tom wasn't very good.
Eat me!
What did you expect?
Eat that bread!
We are women.
What did you answer?
I have two eyes.
I don't think, therefore I am not.
It is raining.
You'll forget about me someday.
Die!
My name is Tom.
Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan - the one you testified about - well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.
I have two books.
Look! A falling star!
He denied it.
"Trust me," he said.
Many thanks.
Eat fruits!
Eat!
Hail!
You can do it.
I love you.

Look at me when I talk to you!
My sword is my life.
Tom hasn't given us anything.
You said that you hated her.
Stay!
Why did you do that?
Go!
Do you believe this?
Hurt people hurt people.
This is what I would have said.
Goodnight!
Tom isn't famous.
I have two older sisters.
I love you.
I eat fruit.
You found me where no one else was looking.
Help!
Can I dance here?
Tom is dead.
Save us.
I thank you.
He's already a man.
Come!
Welcome to Tatoeba!
Eat snow.
Why do you ask?
We're not speaking.
We have a Pope.
Remember!
They can add something if they wish.
I'm going to go.
Where do you come from?
Please.
Are you referring to me?
I don't know what you mean.
I can see you're frightened.
He is pleased with his new shoes.
I have no money, but I have dreams.
Thanks!
Listen!
I already told you.
Would you like to dance with me?
