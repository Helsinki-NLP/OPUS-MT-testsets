The ship swayed in the strong wind.
The criminal was sent into exile.
We're impatient.
She might have met him yesterday.
I wrote him a letter asking him to come home soon.
If you can read this sentence, then you're able to read.
My unhappiness probably is because I very much like to be alone.
When I grow up, I want to be an English teacher.
The president said, "I don't give a damn."
We lit the candles.
I'd like something to eat.
He is a quick walker.
I must buy a pair of shoes.
I like your shoes.
Please don't forget me.
There is no denying the fact.
The man's body temperature is higher than normal.
It is starting to look pretty cool.
Don't let him sleep.
Will you come back home soon?
Do it gently.
What should we do if it rains?
I like to read books.
That is a useful piece of information.
And then what happens?
He called me a taxi.
Are you fucking stupid?
Don't feed the animals.
We care about you, Tom.
How many languages can you speak fluently?
I am learning Turkish.
Let's hear a story of his travels.
I'm not a pirate.

Tom wants to become an electrician.
Tom married Mary.
What's this noise? Is it a train?
He was asleep in the bed.
My boyfriend didn't want to go to the opera, but he finally gave in.
I refuse to accept that.
You should concentrate on the road when you're driving.
Tom never writes.
Tom is wheezing.
I don't want trouble.
It's true.
You looked scared.
We're lawyers.
I don't like lying to her.
I read a book as I walked.
He prided himself on his self-control.
He cut his sister a piece of bread.
May I use your pencil? Any one will do.
I love you.
She likes to walk alone.
Spanish and Portuguese are very similar languages.
I wasn't quite sure about that.
Where are your ancestors from?
That's not possible.
My mouth forms a lot of saliva.
Every time you read a book, you will be the better for it.
You must be cautious.
Where is the milk tea?
What time is it?
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary.
My birthday approaches.
The heroine of this story is a little girl.

We're serious.
It's because it's too big.

Are you up for it?
That makes me very happy.
I think I missed my bus.
We must keep calm.
Tom is my uncle.
Twenty people perished in the blaze.
Yutaka has two elder brothers.
As soon as he arrives, I'll tell him.
He walks slowly.
No one will ever find you.

It just seems wrong.
This bridge will not endure long.
It's fucking hot.
Can I come in?
Why weren't you there?

My money was stolen by a thief.
Either he or I am to attend the meeting.
If that happens, I'll resign.

Your chair is identical to mine.
Do you drink tea?
Please, let somebody hear our voice.

Thank you, my dear.
Tom stepped on my foot.

You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?
I abhor violence.
Yeah. I think so, too.
Do you want me to wait?
I'm in Portugal.
Keep to the left when driving.

I wish you good luck.
He got sick during the trip.

There is a cat in the meeting room.
My bicycle needs fixing.
The little girl was crying for the teddy bear.
You're forgiven.
You must speak in a loud voice.
This failure is due to your mistake.
What's our destination?
I hope you are all well.
Is Tom with Mary?
She took him to the lake.
I'd rather not eat this.
I would like to have some more water.
Tom has never met Mary.
You've been robbed.
Almost everyone was happy.
He is not Japanese.
Nobody cares.
I'll tell him that.
You can use my desk if you want to.
I'm a patient.
I just pretend to be a doctor. I'm not a real doctor.

Is the food good in this restaurant?
It's not cold.
Defend yourself.
He has a bicycle.
I'm a liar.
It's all going to work out.
I am as tired as you.
I am afraid of cats.
I've done everything.
I am really sorry.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
This book is about China.
German is not an easy language.
The man was dying.
I don't work.
We're on our way home.
The women are working.
I usually don't like sweet things, but I will try one of your cookies.
I'll meet you back on the ship.
It is three years since my father died.
Tom is very weak.
We want complete sentences.
I couldn't sleep.
Bob's your uncle.
I need a hammer.
It was there all the time.
I know all that.

What's your father's name?
Clean the table already!
I'm clumsy.
He admitted that he was wrong.
Your pants are dirty.
I want this cat.
"If you stop loving the robot, it will take its revenge upon you" "That robot will--" "Yes" " What type of revenge?" "It will kill you"
Let's forget about what happened yesterday.
Whose tea is this?
Now that you are well again, you can travel.
They're innocent men.
He is said to be a good doctor.
The house started shaking.
I have a pain in my little toe.
I'd like some aspirin.

Do you like Chinese food?
You shall not marry my daughter!
I would like to go with you.

What do you call this bird?
You're completely right.
Will you manage to repair my car?
It'll work now.
Close the door after you.
Don't forget to bring the camera with you.
I hope to stop smoking.
They're not evil.
The flag of his fatherland brought tears to his eyes.
Speak!
Exercise trains the muscles.

Tom is hot.
Who are you waiting for?
Pay attention to his advice.
She was really cold.
He cut the envelope open.
She aimed for his mouth and missed.
What are birds?
He promised he would help us.
The work required to investigate that is boring and wearisome.
Engineers are crazy about solar energy.
I just spoke to him over there.
I refuse to accept it.
They aren't ripe at all. You're going to break your teeth!
Tom hates the whole human race.
Barbara's success is beyond question.
Don't be afraid to break the rules.
He is my brother's friend.
Which do you like better, tea or coffee?
Life is a long, long road.
I keep thinking about them.
He gave me a good piece of advice.
We're fighting a losing battle.
You're not my friend anymore.
I got up at about six.
Everyone was enjoying the journey.
Germany borders on France.
I hate to lose.
Can you hand me a towel?
The door won't open.
Tom is rich.
Cut it out.
I'll ask them if you like.
Maybe you were followed.
She had no intention of quarreling with him.
What the hell is going on here?
May I have some camera batteries, please?
Father came home.
I'm sure we'll find something there.
I'd like to get to know her.
You shall not pass.
We enjoyed talking with each other.
He passed away yesterday.
I don't know her at all.
I had to get all the facts before I could make a decision.
His sisters as well as he are now living in Kyoto.
We've been in contact.
Then I woke up.
She lives alone.
Tom became mute.
Tom has been hypnotized.

It will grow old.
He is learning English.
You're lying to me again.
Your hands are shaking.
This is an ancient law.
I have 13 cats.
Everybody in the picture is smiling.
He is talking.
We won't win.
The telephone doesn't work.
I think you're probably right.
She is strong.
She has a very pretty face.
Don't promise anything.
I will go, be the weather what it may.
How hot it is!
You're not allowed to swim here.
Sami borrowed sixty bucks.
This machine works by electricity.
To speak frankly I don't like him.
He's my partner.
Tom is almost thirty.
He was drunk and angry.
His father disapproved of her.
I used to feed my dog twice a day.
Sazae is always forgetting her own phone number.
He told me that he had lost his watch.
That's why you were always healthy.
Tom is a happy man.
I must open the window.
Can you please translate this for me?
I have to sell my house.
I think Tom hates us.
I'd like to be an American.
Why learn Klingon?
Tom hid under the table.
You're quite right.
You must not read while eating.
I'll need surgery.
I fell asleep.
I received a call from Tom this afternoon.
What did you steal?
We found a turtle in the garden.
We've got to call them.
There you are!

Everyone's saying it.
May it not happen!

Are you scared of me?
He thought someone had put poison in his soup.
I work for a firm of publishers.
How do you cast spells?
This is difficult to do.
Are you ready to study Klingon?
We do not forget.
He's evil.
Sami left Egypt.
Is he breathing?
Do you think it's a good idea?
I met her on my way to school.
Evil spirits are mean.
We sell shoes.
That's new.
He was rich.
Tom doesn't hate you.
My mother is fifty years old.
What do you want me to do with these?
He will get well soon.
He went to the shop.
Did you ever think this would happen?
There are two strangers walking on the street.
The water began to boil.
Eat bread and drink water.
How pretty she looks in her new dress!
I'm not serious.
They missed the plane by two hours.
I'd say you're jealous.
Are you a wizard?
Everyone's there.
She's just evil.
This is not important.
I'll give you a call when I get home.
I need friends.
Sulfur burns with a blue flame.
An apple fell off the tree.
Sharks eat fish.
He made her a new coat.
He is young.
