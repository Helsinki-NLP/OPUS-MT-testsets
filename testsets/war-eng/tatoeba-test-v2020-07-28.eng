I never had to worry about her.
The engine won't start.
That's the part I liked best.
Would you mind if I help?
I will stay there.
Tom put his lunch tray on the table.
I thought I could do that.
There's lots of people at the park.
Why do you have the light on at midnight? Open up. I must know what you're doing.
Tom isn't wearing a belt today.
Tom walked toward the far wall.
I bought one other book in addition to this one.
It's morning here in my time zone.
He must be crazy to say such a thing.
It may rain.
Tom usually sits in the back of the classroom.
Trying to fix this is a waste of time.
If you do that, Tom will be happy.
When did you have your wall painted?
What did you say your name was again?
I won't go unless I have to.
Can you take a little break?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
Recently, everything seems boring to me.
Everybody seems to like her.
Write your name in full.
Must be nice...
Who's this message for?
Could you knock a little off the price?
Where were you last night?
Why do you ask me of all people?
Do we need more inflation?
Would you like to know who that beautiful woman is?
She kept it hidden from me.
Can she be trusted?
My dog follows me wherever I go.
How did you learn German?
Success! Soon, anybody can start learning Klingon!
Never mind.
I had some help.
What's the number?
Tom is reluctant.
The child was scared to get into the water.
He knows how to bet.
When she heard the news, she was not happy.
Everybody knows she married him for his money.
She's going to the hospital.
You want to leave here, don't you?
I prefer walking to driving in a big city like Tokyo.
She finally arrived!
I'm going to lie down for a minute.
Why are you touching my girlfriend?
My father ought to have had an operation for cancer.
I wanted to see you tonight.
I don't want to forget anything.
Where exactly is she?
The room was empty for quite a while.
Let's start right away.
The girl seemed to pay no attention to him.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
I waited for her till it got dark.
He can see nothing without his glasses.
I won't let her die.
Tom is leaving in the morning.
Every day is a gift.
Human stupidity knows no limits.
I don't really remember.
I bought forty dollars' worth of gasoline today.
I'll definitely miss you.
They're really cool.
I wanted to help Tom pay his bills.
That's a hard question.
You're probably too young to understand this.
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
I saw her again.
Their jeans do not fit.
Tom lied about his grade.
It's rare to find big yards in Japan.
Why would Tom be angry?
That snake is poisonous.
Come back here.
She is more beautiful than any other girl.
When was the last time you talked to Mary?
Let me find out.
Turn on the light. I can't see anything.
Are they friends of yours?
I like Tom better.
Learning a new language is difficult at first.
Do you know where she is?
Tom opened the freezer and got out the ice cream.
How do you change that?
This is all I ever wanted to do.
I want to go to Australia.
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
I saw him looking at me.
We don't know much about her personal life.
I study English at school.
There's no life on the moon.
He remains loyal to his principles.
The two men were not related.
Are you gay?
Tom is complaining to the manager.
Do you still want us to meet?
It's neither good nor bad.
Tom seems stressed.
Tom saw Mary hiding behind the door.
If I were you, I'd go.
There are many possible explanations.
It's too ugly.
I think you're all wrong.
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
Why is everybody in here?
Who will take care of your cat then?
She walks at a slow pace.
They are not interested in other languages.
Tom wants to take it.
Tom helped me find my way here.
You're going?
You have, no doubt, heard of our company.
Many young girls like that singer.
That's quite meaningless.
I've lost my appetite.
I think they saw you.
I met him yesterday.
He does things for himself. He doesn't like to bother other people.
Their oldest sister still hasn't gotten married.
I want you to be better.
The light became weaker and weaker.
Do you still want us to meet?
Tom has family problems.
Let me think for just a second.
We didn't come here to watch you pet your dog.
It serves you right.
When are you picking it up?
He bikes to work.
I only want to help him.
Doing that is your responsibility.
It serves you right.
She will be here this evening.
Teaching asks for a lot of patience.
Such is human life. A few joys, very quickly wiped out by unforgettable sorrows.
These cars are made in Japan.
I saw many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which had no people in them.
I think something terrible has happened to Tom.
I wish I'd bought that bicycle.
Japan is weird.
One can drink too much, but one never drinks enough.
You won.
Next week, I will probably read a book and watch TV.
You don't really know me, Tom.
Turn on the light. I can't see anything.
Have you ever listened to this song?
Will you show me the book?
That girl whose hair is long is Judy.
The room was empty for quite a while.
Tom is just a boy.
You never arrive on time.
Why doesn't Tom want to do that?
Man, what the hell are you looking for?
I saw her again.
They shook hands with each other.
If everyone agrees to it, I won't vote against it.
He is pleased with his new car.
Tom knows he shouldn't have said that.
It's an answer to her letter.
Why is she burning her novel?
They will find out sooner or later.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Tom couldn't bear the pain any more so he shot himself.
I borrowed money not only from Tom, but from his wife, too.
You must not forget to check your paper before you hand it in.
Are you in Australia?
I don't intend to stay in Boston much longer.
Two women sing.
Do you like rock and roll?
Everyone refused to help me.
Keep watch on him.
The teacher kicked her out of class.
You're sick. You have to rest.
Is this your book, Mike?
Who was Mona Lisa?
As long as you do what you've been told, we'll have absolutely no problem.
I'm all set.
Yoga can help reduce stress.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do that Tom can't.
Yumi goes to the park to play tennis.
I'll ask Tom for you.
Their jeans do not fit.
I was very skeptical.
This place is different.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
I only saw him once.
Nobody does that.
If I were you, I'd go.
That's the choice we made.
He is not the shy boy he used to be.
Tom wanted to know what had happened.
The light became weaker and weaker.
You cannot outsmart destiny.
Tom will go to Boston tomorrow.
I think the pay is enough.
I don't know how much longer it'll take.
He answered in tears.
I thought you'd be glad to see Tom.
If I could live again, I would like to be a musician.
Hi. If I'm not mistaken, you're our new neighbors, aren't you?
Mary says she doesn't remember anything.
Drop me a postcard.
They haven't seen the likes of it.
What did you think of Tom?
For the past 10 years, I've fed my dog dry dog food.
It is doubtful whether this will work.
It was your mistake, not mine.
We must make sure that Tom doesn't hurt himself.
The worst of it has already happened.
Ask Alex.
You can't hide the fact from her.
Did you hear that, Mike?
They probably saw our ship come into port.
There are four trash cans in the school: one for paper, one for plastic, and two more for glass and metal.
I only went there once.
I was wondering when you were going to tell me.
He can't afford to buy a new car.
She is a very refined lady.
It never occurred to me that Tom might not be telling the truth.
Why didn't you tell her that?
I would have liked to have seen 'Casablanca' when the movie was discussed.
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
I'm going with Tom.
You may get it free of charge.
He's unable to do that.
The ship slowly started to move.
I hope you are well.
Could you come to my office when you have a moment?
Out of all the people at your school, who do you like the most?
This is Tony's book.
Tom quickly learned how to swim.
I'm trying to find out why it happened.
I know that Tom didn't do that.
I won't do it anymore.
This TV was made ten years ago and there are no parts available, so it is impossible to repair it.
The thing that scares me the most is that I might lose you.
Shut up and take my money!
He's unable to do that.
Take good care of Tom.
I used to go home for lunch in those days.
I almost got robbed.
You're the only one here who thinks it's a good idea to do that.
Did you get the loan?
Let's not beat around the bush! I'm pregnant, and you're the baby's father.
Get the bicycle out of the way.
Everybody had a hard time.
Tom says he sees things that I can't see.
They weren't listening.
I have no name.
How did people know I wasn't Canadian?
They helped each other.
Wait until I'm done eating.
Tell me how you feel about Tom.
There's lots of people at the park.
She began to talk to the dog.
I can't do this without Tom's help.
We'll do it when we have time.
If only he had been there.
He will go to New York next month.
I sat down next to Tom.
I hope you can do this.
When I was young I wouldn't wear pants.
There are plans to build a power plant right here.
The police are not here to arrest you.
She didn't show up at the party, but nobody knows why.
I don't know.
What do you need that for?
It's rat meat.
A thief broke into the house while we were away.
You should call your father as soon as possible.
I'm in love with Jean Reno.
I like Tom better.
She trusted me and she would tell me anything.
I don't want to go with her.
It's not good to stay up late at night.
Tom thinks he's going to win the race.
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
Tom has left Boston already.
Everyone refused to help me.
I want to give them this.
He's not breaking the law.
That's the choice we made.
Who are your parents?
You opened up my eyes to what it's like when everything is right.
Can she be trusted?
She will be here this evening.
Tom drank too much wine.
This is going to be a great day!
There's nothing we can do about Tom.
This is all I need.
Tom says he can't believe anybody.
Just a moment - there's someone at the door.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Tom wasn't the first one to be eliminated.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
Leave it be, Tom.
The exercises are simple and effective.
We'll notify him.
A lot of people are dealing with allergies now.
We certainly can't blame you.
Make sure you do that again.
I know that feeling, too.
How many mangoes do you want?
I cannot read French.
He murders English.
That's a very personal question.
Hurry up, and you will be in time for the bus.
I heard Tom humming to himself while he washed dishes.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
The cause of the accident is still not clear.
I'm easily influenced.
The same thing happened in Boston.
There was a lot of students absent from class today.
There's nothing remaining.
Do you want to speak privately?
Don't get that close to the fire.
The Socialist Party only got 18% of the votes.
I love arguing with Tom.
I'm going with Tom.
Take hold of the rope, and I'll pull you up.
I can depend on Tom.
I found this under your bed.
Did you see a doctor?
Please call a taxi.
You can't hurt me anymore.
I really need to sleep.
He likes to watch the birds fly above his head.
He can't afford to buy a new car.
Locate Puerto Rico on a map.
You did not make a single mistake? That had to be blind luck!
I didn't kiss him. He kissed me.
Why didn't you tell her that?
Some people believe in God and other people don't.
I crossed the river by boat.
He retired because of the loss of his health.
Don't worry, I can take it.
You can trust Tom.
I think you might be able to help us.
You don't need to be in that much of a hurry.
I want you to guess.
Merry Christmas!
I'd like to try this.
Tom is just a regular guy.
Soon you'll get used to living by yourself.
If your answer is correct, it follows that mine is wrong.
He was delighted to see you.
Let's dine out for a change.
Tom decided to leave.
Is there anyone in the room?
We must stop this.
Mostar is a very beautiful city.
If he'd been alone at that time, he'd have died.
She switched on a machine.
Tom doesn't know what to do first.
Tom does what's right for him.
Who wants to visit the Philippines? It is such a tropical paradise!
I am not an owl!
Does your mother know?
I wish you a quick recovery.
What newspaper do you read?
You bought a coat yesterday, didn't you?
You are wasting your time.
We have nothing to complain about.
Are you listening, Tom?
I'm not ready for it yet.
The baby needs his mother.
All planes have wings.
Tom told Mary he had to go home early.
It started to rain at four o'clock in the morning.
Not until yesterday did I know the truth.
She measured the length of the room.
I think you don't trust me.
I can't believe that this is happening. Please tell me that it's a lie!
Tom is usually the first to get here.
Why do you care so much?
I am not so poor that I cannot send my son to college.
The war brought ruin to the country.
Put it there.
We'll always be here.
How do we know it isn't a trap?
Where is the elevator?
He comes to see me nearly every day.
I'm a little behind schedule.
Tom will go to Boston tomorrow.
I am very glad school is over.
She was similar to me in many ways.
Why didn't you write to me right away?
Don't disturb us.
I'm 24.
Two children are sitting on top of the fence.
Tom was fingerprinted by the police.
Let's take a short pause.
He lives close by.
It won't last forever.

Tom did it voluntarily.
I made a lot of money.
I want to help her, but I don't know how.
Let's unearth the garlics.
It's not always easy to translate.
I'm going, too.
I'm asking your opinion.
He's all by himself.
I never touch beer.
I'm going to stop Tom.
He didn't even call me.
Who told you that I was sick?
Tom walked in and looked around for Mary.
This kind of wood is tough to saw through.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
This is the more useful of the two.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
How long do you think you can stay here?
Don't you like Chinese food?
This is an evil company that takes advantage of people.
I'm the one who rescued you.

We're going to have fun with this.

She is out of danger.
It's Saturday today.
The day turned out to be fine.

Where are you guys heading now?
The situation called for quick, decisive action.
If I had known her address, I would have written to her.
Please tell them what they need to do.
He is pleased with his new car.
I don't have a cat.
All my friends will be there.

When two people quarrel, a third rejoices.
Let's go and find Tom.

I thought I'd have another chance to do that.
