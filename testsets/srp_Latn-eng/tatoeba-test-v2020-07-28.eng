I'm sure it was a coincidence.
It's a living being, so of course it shits.
Tom can write well.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom'll improve.
Tom works in advertising.
They're a brass quintet.
I don't care if our team wins or not.
How far is it from here?
What are you doing?
Did I invite you?
We won't let you die.
What am I supposed to say?
I'm a little bummed.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps moaning that she has no time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's difficult for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
She didn't bat an eyelid.
What did it all mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everybody smiled.
It would be helpful if you could do that for me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the work done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
It's not a big deal.
How much will I receive?
I'm teasing.
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.
We're not finished yet.
I want you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I've tried to stop multitasking.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let's give this a shot.
Can I talk to you privately?
Did you see the sunrise earlier? It was really beautiful.
She put the ring on her finger.
He is as intelligent as his brother.
Tom is away on business.
I still can't remember where I put my keys.
How did you get that scar?
You couldn't tell it by looking, but she has the legendary tale of having eaten two whole cakes when a child.
I can't live that kind of life.
Tom was real hungry.
It was a hard decision.
Everyone's crying.
Octopus Paul was right.
He likes soccer a lot.
What are you doing down here?
I'm still not ready yet.
Do you skip breakfast in the mornings?
A Norwegian diplomat had been hostile to the Soviet Union, so the KGB initiated a compromising action against the Norwegian. He had a Russian girlfriend and was asked to immediately leave the country.
Don't drink the water.
Thank you very much for an inspiring comment.
Haven't you done enough?
I'll make it up to Tom.
Keep a low profile.
Do you think that games and learning are compatible?
I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
Layla had a large circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What year was your car made?
Check, please.
Make sure the cat's out and all the doors are locked when you leave.
It remains to be seen if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a freelancer translator.
Tom drummed his fingers on the table nervously.
Did you go out last night? Because you look pretty bad today ...
I have a match to play.
Tom needs a doctor.
I like instrumental music.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just please be quiet.
We've got one casualty.
You need to let me in.
The eternal snow seems not so eternal anymore.
They aren't mine.
What I saw was depressing.
We'll never go back there again.

Tom sat back down.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I don't trust talkative people.
Even a chief detective like Tom fails in doing his job, without the huge help of colleagues and associates.
How can I protect myself?
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.
We must get rid of Tom.
Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Please forget I said that.
I've failed.
Tom wants to work at the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom.
Another store will be opened in Boston soon.
It shocked me.
Tom is well off.
Tom told us this morning that he and Mary were moving to Boston.
Could you save me a couple of cookies?
I have an allergy to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolates.
Tom is a real nerd.
Eat your soup while it's warm.
I'm not giving this up.
Let me save you some trouble.
I've never tried doing this before.
Did I drop that?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss, because he's a male chauvinist pig.
I've been everywhere in Europe.
Are you almost here?
It is a white lie.
What would this buy me?
Mini-skirts are back in fashion again.
Thanks for the correction.
I'm glad that you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, let me know.
I have been looking for you.
I don't think much of him as a musician.
Tom got shot down.
Have you told Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
Everyone's sick.
My dad said no.
Many people pray before eating.
Where was she going?
I think you'll not be able to do that.
And just who might you be?
Continue working.
They have improved safeguards and they are now better prepared than before.
It's empty.
I'm not even sure that I'm right, truth be told.
Don't argue.
Tom was a very good skier when he was a teenager.
Defend yourself.

It's time for school.
It's empty.

Tom is a very clever boy.
Tom is wrong about that.
I believe Elvis is still alive.
Tom wasn't supportive.
Don't forget to write the zip code.
How did you like Boston?
I can't help myself.
Her boyfriend was not supportive.
The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl released the birds from the cage.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be scared of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I passed every single test.
I'm tired of your whining.
There's only one way out.
Which brother did you see?
I'll check.
He's rather busy just now.
I'm not sure whether Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland be an independent country?
Can you tell me a little about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I've believed in Kylie Minogue since June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
Yesterday I went to bed without brushing my teeth.
Danger lurks around every corner.
Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
You're getting careless.
Is it necessary to make so much noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't run from the past.
Please excuse my being late.
Tom is a stand-up guy.
I'm hoping to find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what had happened.
I'm sure that Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
The doghouse is new.
I got an email yesterday that was written in French.
Why are you so paranoid?
He resembles his father very much.
Tom ran his fingers through his hair.
I wrote some poems last weekend.
What am I doing here?
Have you got a dog?
They're going to be OK.
The family had its dinner at noon.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
She will clean my room.
Tom and I aren't friends. We're just coworkers.
I can't see who it is.
Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could've gone, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were as cold as ice.
One day he will be mine.
Tom refused to go to bed.
It turned out to be true.
Anything you remember might help.
You will be famous.
Don't stop.
Tom managed to escape just in time.
I love watching you dance.
I'm real proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very beautiful.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really happy I'm here.
I can't answer your question with any certainty.
God beware me!
None of us saw Tom do that.
Let's discuss our options.
I was just going to suggest that you do that.
She decided to go and study in the USA.
It was really inspiring.
Tom has three adult sons.
Get a ticket for me.
Do you still want this?
So, what's it gonna be?
This is my third marriage.
The next time will be surely better.
The text has been heavily edited.
We're all trying to win.
Check around.
This box is almost empty.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
There's nothing to stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could go with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe that Tom kissed me.
I will try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and John brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is it love?
Today, the ship remained over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - a mountain range located on the bottom of the ocean at depths of up to 3 miles.
Yes, I love it.
It was a little tricky.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament has been dissolved.
I hope that isn't true.
Have you already finished?
Tom never would agree to that.
You seem like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She stood and walked toward the window.
It was something which brought a stream of new ideas.
We will visit you occasionally.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's difficult.
Tom felt very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She came on strong.
It's gotten dark.
We better tell the others.
Please tell me about your teacher.
I always think about that.
Tom bought a pair of black leather shoes.
I wasn't worried about it.
What else could I have done?
I will eat supper at seven.
Pua sang at church.
Everyone was sitting at the table.
The students didn't know how to give an answer.

It's started.
I'm proud of this team.
I'm still around.
Tom is singing.
Don't smile.
Have you told Tom this?
You're going to wreck your eyesight if you play games all the time.
I am an Earthling.
I read many foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things will happen.
Say hello to your friends.
What? You still don't know how to drive a car?
I've forgotten.
Getting used to it will take a while.
I'll be there.
We're not going ashore.
You are right in a way.
Despite me telling Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
It's a piece of cake.
I'm good at many things.
Tom is playing catch with his son.
I'm going to leave school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance from my house to your house is two kilometers.
You're just wasting our time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He accelerated.
Get a shot of this.
It's of no consequence.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom'll go.
Is any of this real?
What are you going to do today?
He is a man of tradition.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I have another one?
I really want to see you again.
Let's sit for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed a bit angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not to eat after 7:00pm.
I'm sure Tom is proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.
You were right to worry.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Tom lives downtown.
Don't be presumptuous.
Things are quite different now.
I'm really curious.
Tom took a taxi to the hospital.
I really like your music.
There are no jobs here.
Could you please tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm excited about this.
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
You're contagious.
We need you to help us.
Has Tom been informed?
Tofu goes well with sake.
I'm sure that Tom will come to the party.
I don't want to swim.
She is as beautiful as her mother.
You have a good point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us a little space.
Don't stand.
Cut it out, Tom.
Tom intended to ask his boss for a raise, but he reconsidered.
Get inside.
You've won!
Tom likes them both.
Tom told me I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I say that all the time.
Most scientists had rejected the continental-drift theory because it had been so difficult to imagine that plate movements were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What have you told Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them just enough food every day.
Tom'll change.
I reacted instinctively.
You have to do that somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload videos to YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everybody knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
It's not that easy.
I am deeply ashamed.
I'm not upset anymore.
Are you fully recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It is raining hard.
Tom is out sick today.
Tom likes them both.
Is it dangerous when a melanoma has spread?
I'm sad to be leaving.
Tom almost got caught.
They are the ones who want to go.
The teacher explained to us the meaning of the poem.
What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Get inside.
We have our backs to the wall.
That's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just so grateful for you.
You have it all wrong.
Now, what do you think?
Let's wait a while.
Tom is a lousy kisser.
Start counting.
You can never go back.
He is a man of flesh and blood with all his flaws.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He ended up in jail.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink the water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom has been saving up money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I see your ticket?
Sorry, I don't follow.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man is promoted before a woman, it's called favoritism. If she gets promoted before a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom uses that word a lot.
Tom stared at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is that your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I came.
We are what we are.
He's a biologist.
It was kind of strange.
Shut your filthy mouth.
Show me your documents.
I'm still grieving from the death of my eldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
Are you going back now?
He must be over sixty.
Have you eaten anything?
I've already been there.
I never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you've written.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We should discuss this in private.
I'm siding with Tom.
We almost got caught a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's best man.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a greater friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom is a house painter.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family liked the dog very much.
You're right on the money.
They can never achieve that any other way than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance to do that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed that you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom is laughing at Mary.
It's nearly half past two.
I don't know if that will be enough money for me.
Can you close the drapes?
Have you ever tried it?
That seems inhumane to me.
Have you had any lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little cat? Would you like some sour cream?
This isn't what we envisioned for you.
I've never played soccer before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he had been wearing his seat belt.
It looked yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I'm strongly opposed to a compromise.
Everything has a price.
Tom picked Mary up.
I might not sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been there.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
A jawbreaker is a round candy, multi-layered like a pearl.
What kind of problems do you have?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everybody smiled.
I'm lying.
Tom is in the clubhouse.
Don't fight.
Just be careful of Tom.
I'll understand.
I'm in better shape than you are.
Maybe they are somewhere around the pond.
I wish I had known.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom is out of practice.
I don't have enough time to explain that to you in detail.
I'll speak to Tom about that.
I'm hurt.
Let's discuss your idea.
It's normal.
I was just about to say that.
I'll phone her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Knock it off, Tom.
It's impossible to tell for certain.
Tom had never been away from home before.
I can't speak Turkish.
It's only been one day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Get started.
That's going to take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
The knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom could speak French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's get some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
I've never played soccer before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I've had a look around.
One senator has called a president of another country, an officer of the old intelligence service which would like to restore that country's old empire.
Do you still want tea?
A nail punctured the tire.
Do you think Tom is the one who broke the window?
I'll speak to Tom about that.
Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You look really pale. Are you all right?
She hesitated for a second.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you a question?
I want us to be more than friends.
Could you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things must pass.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I drive you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he wanted my help.
Without a doubt!
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use a hand.
Tom is still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that I shouldn't do that.
Infrared and ultra-violet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have downloaded that.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher" they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets mad, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you've written.
There's really no need for you to do that.
I hope that the weather will be dry.
Could you have a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
How could I help it?
I bought lots of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Bring it in, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
Education in this world disappoints me.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Marija bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I hear only you.
It is rare for him to get angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Have you washed the dishes?
After he came back from service in Afghanistan, Tom was plagued by flashbacks and nightmares.
I've decided.
Thank you very much!
That won't have an effect.
Don't stare.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggested should save us all a little time.
Wonderful!
He's rather busy just now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom is boiling the potatoes to make potato salad.
Everybody stayed.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you managed to do that.
Be that as it may, you are wrong.
It is difficult to give up a long love suddenly.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I've got a white horse.
Let's discuss this over lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Does that price include breakfast?
Tom hates foreigners.
We must respect the rights of the individual.
What is that thing in your right hand?
May I call around 2:30?
Anybody wanna go to Disneyland with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write this kind of song.
It really is that easy.
It was a silly mistake.
What do you eat, anyway?
Don't speak.
Call it what you like.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he was unable to.
Yumi will become a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
It wasn't important to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy here for me.
I'm glad that Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom that you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote Mary a long letter, but he didn't send it to her.
He has a good memory.
Cold numbs the limbs.
Tom isn't very nice.
I really needed Tom there.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Have you ever known Tom to lie?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's rather busy just now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom looked very puzzled.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about that.
Don't slouch.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom'll know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough for now.
Look back!
Nine pounds of gold was needed to gild the victory medals.
Give me the sword.
He isn't smart enough to add up numbers in his head.
Watch over me, I will watch over you.
You have to trust me.
I think your plan is not realistic.
Are you acquainted with the man?
Would you talk to Tom for me?
We must act at once.
I do not fear death, but dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually ever met Tom.
Don't yell.
This is one of a kind.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
We'll just follow you.
To know oneself is very difficult.
Save your energy. You're going to need it later.
Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You've just been shot.
My income has decreased ten percent.
Unfamiliar terrain can be difficult to traverse.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After long reflection, I decided to take things as they come.
It's right.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen a lot?
We're downsizing.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the television.
I wear short-sleeve shirts in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom hoped that he would become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems that he'd written when he was a teenager.
Where is the Avis counter?
Tom might be able to tell us how to do that.
I was just heading out.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come on in here.
Tomorrow I'm going back home.
I think you're stupid to do that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad about lying.
They told me to wait here.
I am not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom'll remember.
Why not just tell Tom?
If there is no porn of it, porn will be made of it.
Canada is the motherland of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom is saving money so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You guys can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave Tom that.
I'm glad that Tom won.
This is, without a doubt, an embarrassing situation for me.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road goes to the city.
I'm not happy with it.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't speak.
We had a terrible fight.
Stop watching TV and start studying.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police recovered the stolen money.
I've never noticed that before.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do that either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
How unfortunate!
I'm tired of arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't yell.
I cannot stop thinking of the stolen money.
You've missed the boat.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anybody.
They needed one another.
I'm trying to be cautious.
Check this.
Come quickly!
Where is my suitcase?
He wishes to erase bad memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Easy does it.
I pretended that I didn't know what was going on.
My friend scored 95 on the maths exam.
Tom wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
You're in for trouble.
There is no word for liberty in the Russian language.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could it be true?
Keep it down, Tom.
I hope Tom is safe.
We talked about it all night.
What'll you be doing this summer?
I've tried to stop multitasking.
Let's make a break for it.
That must've been hard.
I'll phone her tonight.
I've had to make some tough choices.
Ammonia is a base.
Check again.
Are you being truthful?
That made perfect sense to me.
Tell me what I must do.
I wasn't told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
The bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought a newspaper.
That one's for me, too.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never take me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's about time you went to bed.
Give me one dollar for the book.
What is this?
Tom fell back to sleep.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You sure got fat fast.
Tom'll succeed.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at multitasking.
Nobody's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
Will I be the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You may not enter that room.
Everything's here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have gotten involved with your hair-brained scheme.
We've been cooperative.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom has been saving up to buy a yacht.
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You drive me crazy.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
A new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road connection to Oslo and eastern Norway for the entire western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about it.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are plotting something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom was able to find Mary's house without any problem.
It's not an easy sport.
I just won't do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It is their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
My mother is cooking for me.
I'm trying to be cautious.
The woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must've eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows that I don't like Tom.
Stay away from thinner addicts.
That's the one I liked.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You've no idea how right you are.
Tom and I've been busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
Tom is an easy guy to get along with.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends had teased her.
I think no one knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was pacing in his room, unable to calm himself down.
Would you mind giving me a hug?
I found the cage empty.
Take a break, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you drop around sometime?
She's asking how that's possible.
Take a look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary is a wedding planner.
Houston, we've had a problem here.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends had teased her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You need to come home.
Alice smiled.
We can look at a suit-clad Tom at a black grand piano, moving his fingers dramatically, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds knocked down a lot of tree branches last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 pupils in this class.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
It's time for you to get up.
The house was built of bricks.
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
People were nice to me.
Tom is now out of sight.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried it?
I could go with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
There's really no need for you to do that.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
To join the choir, you have to be able to read music.
Tom was half asleep.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I take vitamins every day.
I'll call back a bit later.
Why me?
Tom cooks for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says that he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's just the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She allowed me to go.
It is very natural for a human being that one always give himself precedence over the interests of others.
Everything's OK.
Do you think Tom is the one who broke the window?
I have a lot of stuff planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still up? You should get to bed.
I was present at school yesterday.
Tom does what is asked of him.
I'm still on the clock.
Callous, unemotional children can sometimes become adult sociopaths.
I'd like you to have it.
The police's job is to prevent and investigate crime.
Could you pass me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom is learning very quickly.
You're different.
Hating others is foreign to her.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves soccer.
Monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him any more.
Keep children away from medicine.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I could be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Driving for one and a half hours to get to work is a bear.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea that I'd be here.
This is not important.
Tom is in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm neutral.
I turned around.
I had completely forgotten to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
It's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us find such views to be sheer madness.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't even write one letter to Mary while he was away.
We've had enough of you.
We all know that Tom is guilty.
We need to be prudent.
I'll be around back.
Take a look at these.
Remember to renew your passport.
I think Tom got a raw deal.
I bet Tom never spoke to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a little ill.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom is OK.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great difficulty.
I will go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write down the number?
That's not a reason to panic.
I scored 20 on the maths exam.
I'm really happy I'm here.
What're you looking at?
I still do not understand anything.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Examine this.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake one, right?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
It's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Please help us track this card.
I'm not mad at anybody.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How clever!
To put it briefly, I do not agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You don't date, do you?
I used to play piano long ago, so I can still play a little.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
The mother and daughter represented two generations.
He makes it a rule to work in the garden for two hours every day.
One gives away apples and pears, and not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really love working out.
I'm real proud of that.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Is it not black?
You're right on the money.
Come, sit by me.
Let's not discuss this now.
It's time to say goodbye.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I like dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The report on the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What do you eat, anyway?
I don't like to be judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Man hopes as long as he lives.
Take care.
Let's discuss our options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We try.
Why is this our problem?
Tom can handle this.
Go and have a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Urgh..." "So hey, you remember that one that she sent you where she asked you to get her those pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yeah." "And then she told you to write a critique on Mac's physical appearance." "Yeah." "Then she sent the critique to Mac." "...Yeah." "What did you tell her you learned from that?" "I found that a Phillips screwdriver is persuasive, but not seductive; and also Rarity charges up the butt for stuff I really think she should do as a friend."
I've always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I only go to church out of duty to my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer those questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You shouldn't eat just before you go to bed.
Tom'll wait.
The students didn't know how they should answer.
I'm not a night person.
Tom bought a VIP pass.
I'm the one who should be doing that.
Tom'll call.
He had lit the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anybody.
This is quite a place.
I don't live with Tom.
I've heard that Tom has dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom'll understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room here.
There is some truth in what Tom says.
You said nothing wrong.
I'm tired of your whining.
Get out!
We have two television sets.
We like to play soccer.
Step aside.
The horse must have stumbled and have toppled the knight.
I'm looking into that right now.
She achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he likes as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said that he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Give me a break.
Tom likes them both.
We sat together in silence for some time.
You're looking very well.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
The two sides hold talks this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave off your beard?
Tom isn't a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a taxi!
I saw the cat.
I'm plastered.
Mother has just gone out shopping.
I get nervous at immigration.
Tom needs to be helped.
Defend yourself.
He took a taxi to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Tom is a misfit.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I really don't know.
Those are your options.
It's safer.
Please tell me about your teacher.
I have seen a dog.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient breathed his last.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose handwriting is this?
It feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to be leaving.
The eagle is king of birds.
The fire was on the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to marry.
What did both of you do?
I'm afraid you've misunderstood this.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to the information.
I'm grounded.
The cat was lying stretched out at full length in the sunlight streaming through the window.
Do you go to school on foot or by bicycle?
Tom isn't much happier.
Will I be the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Tom and Mary were the only ones who were saved.
I'm through.
I wasn't very impressed by that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapons, a beautiful face and a young body, are of transient value.
I saw a mouse.
He tries.
The two countries negotiated a peace treaty.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
They seemed to know what they wanted.
You've tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's give this a shot.
I'd like to know what's happening here.
Tom really knows a lot.
Tom needs his sleep.
I must tell Tom that.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure that Tom will come to the party.
Tom isn't a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm vegetarian.
It's what I'm used to doing.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That is very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in, please.
Tom asked me some questions about what had happened.
I'll keep you updated.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
She's way out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all shocked?
Schools and roads are services paid for by taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
It looks like it's just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where is Tehran?
Let's watch that again.
That sounds like treason to me.
It needs exercise.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the cartoon, he wrote "Get your hot dogs!"
Drive slowly.
What a man you are!
Measure twice, cut once!
How long's Tom had it?
We can save a little time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you wish to speak with many people, you ought to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is both beautiful and stimulates our study. An international language is of great moment because there are so many people in the various countries of the world. And besides, Esperanto is not only useful but easy to learn. If you speak Esperanto you can travel in many countries. Come and learn it!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get any sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful granddaughters.
Don't fight.
She drummed her fingers on the table.
I am studying several languages.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
You're nice to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I wasn't interested in it.
That isn't true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
You never arrive on time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to persuade Mary not to leave.
Tom'll improve.
Tom was good and scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We've got to get away.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
It's what I'm used to doing.
Tom is still on the job.
Closing your eyes helps you think better.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was moaning in pain.
All or nothing.
Are they in love?
I contributed.
I'll sign it.
You're embarrassing him.
That's exactly right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom is rich and single.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I really don't know.
I hope it will be good.
The wind has abated.
I have a full-length mirror in my bedroom.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Don't you say a word.
What should you do?
Come out of there.
A ‘chek-chek’ festival took place in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Whatever gave you that idea?
She allowed me to go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're inside.
No one is coming to save you.
I have no desire to do that.
Tom is always bothering me.
Are you about ready?
She prides herself on her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of those.
I'm impressed with you.
I'm having trouble deciding where to park.
Cool!
How is that your fault?
Security was increased in the city.
Bless you.
Tom'll stay.
That boy speaks as if he were an adult.
Carrots cost three dollars.
My motorcycle is new.
Tom told me today that he loved me.
I don't think Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
I've tried that already.
Get upstairs.
You aren't allowed to park there.
I jog in the morning.
Tom thinks the same way.
He is such a show off.
How long did you stay?
Tom is an avid cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's see.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family moved around a lot.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
And they all lived happily ever after.
Tom is too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't stare.
I'm interested.
What's the harm in that?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was made by accident.
Is the handsome man an Arab or an Indian?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I put my hat.
He had once again drunk one over the eight.
I also want to see the ocean.
Don't you say a word.
Who doesn't do that?
Tom does that sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
How about I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said that he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or yawn.
Tom bites his nails.
He was a man who never hesitated to disagree.
Rabies is probably introduced periodically by polar foxes on drift ice from Siberia.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.

I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's that restaurant's name?
It's official business.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget him.
I agreed to buy it.
What do the papers say?
The surface temperature of the sun is around 6000°C.
Sami was asking a lot of questions about Islam.
If we leave now, we could be back in Boston by 2:30.

Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It is difficult to ascertain what really happened.
She ran her fingers through her hair.
Tom is working hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says that he has 4 homes in 5 different countries.
Let's see what Tom says.
I'm famished.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're OK.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of growing old.
I don't completely agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat the ice cream now before it melts.
I'm only doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you dance.
It is difficult to put what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?
Åle, the world's oldest eel, just died. He was approximately 150 years old.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I overslept.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Did you see anybody there?
My father is so old that he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I wish I could paint like that.
I will try to find them.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't know what's been going wrong, but several times when I tried to log onto the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there on my own free will.
Closing your eyes helps you think better.
They did mean that.
Have you ever been there?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Everyone's here.
We're almost done.
They may need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
The prison escapee was quickly recaptured.
Anything seemed possible back in those days.

Lately I've been having trouble with my memory.
Tom may not make it to the meeting.
Tom died almost instantly.
The judge banged his gavel.
They have also found that the same miscalculation was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We've got to find Tom.
Let's hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for several days.
Tom might be there.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't stare.
It should be possible to change that.
Does Tom have cable?

Wonderful!
That's wonderful!

I'm dyslexic.
You've been a big help.
Identify yourself.
I'm very happy about that.
That's just the way it's got to be.

We need to focus on our strengths.
How fast!

We'll go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
Don't you remember anything?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from here.

May I go?

Do you have a copy?
Come and help me out.
I had hardly left home when it began raining.
Tom likes to keep busy.
First things first.

I'm a little bummed.
Does this mean that you love me?
Check this.
Is there any proof?
You must be strong.
Are you ready for more?
Tom put on his blinker.
Tom always made me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed before eleven o'clock.
Are they all nuts?
What do you eat, anyway?
That's an unusual one.

Continue digging.

Do you want in on this?
I knew I should never have gotten involved with your harebrained scheme.
Tom asked for my permission to use my computer.
Was I really that happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his opinion?
Beat it.
Do you think what she said is a lie?
His little brother is a famous soccer player.
I've just been too busy.
I've already ordered it.
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be difficult.
She cooked him meals.
Where did you learn English?

Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended that I didn't know Tom.
I saw a hippopotamus at the zoo.

Could you read it?
The window is made of glass.
Have you already finished?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
You'll get better in a few days.
It's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm still not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom is a bookworm.
I had second thoughts.
The problem is in that it's too expensive.
Many people would like to be motivated, innovative, thinking beings if they could only get the opportunity.
You sound tired.
Tom wasn't right about that.
Tom is always making a mess of things.
It's not the real thing.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could stay the night.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're having a barbecue.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.

Have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.

I'm not happy with it.
Could you read it?
We've got to call Tom.
Tom isn't strong enough.
Tell me what this says.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly hurt.
If you need help, let me know.
I took the first step.
I'm still kind of tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
The first one leaves at 17.30 and arrives at 20.25.
It was kind of strange.
Can Tom read and write Japanese?
Tom put the map on the table.
It was all an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do so.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That one usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Get upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now a word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main issue.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help himself.
It's time to sleep.
Tom wanted to have a nicer car than his neighbors.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a hair dryer?

How've you been feeling?
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
Everything's dirt-cheap.
Anything you remember might help.
Many predictions fail.

I still make mistakes.
It turned out to be true.
It tastes bitter to me.
Tom loves a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows everything about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man of many talents.

Tom and Mary are as different as night and day.
Tom asked me who I thought would win the race.
Man has many wishes that he does not really wish to fulfil, and it would be a misunderstanding to suppose the contrary. He wants them to remain wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfilment would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally, and yearn for death.
Can Tom really speak French?
I am not a prophet.
I'm not able to fix the car by myself.
She takes care of her old mother.

Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope that you like it.
She'll return very soon.
Enjoy it while you can.

What do you plan to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.

This information is confidential.
No.

Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve the project. It leaves much to be desired.
Are you texting Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary is a soccer mom.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
I tried to persuade Tom to come home.
What have you concluded?
I've been praying for you.
The bathroom is upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom has tricked you.
It is only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals wantonly mistreated animals.
Until when shall you tell us off?
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
I'll teach you how to play the ukulele if you want me to.
I'm used to it now.
It's not all that bad.
I like to play music written by my friends.
Tom admitted that.

This report is very sloppily written.
She points out that this latest gesture of the government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It lasted about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.

Tell me what this is.
His hair almost covered his whole face.

You've been really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Have you washed the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually seem happy?
The essay itself isn't a problem, but all these pernicious questions and glossary make me awfully mad!
The weekend is here.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
It was a lucky guess.
I thought Tom was awesome.
I had never seen anything like that before.
I buy loads of stuff at that store.
I wish you were here with me.
Take a sip of this.
Clean up a little.
Don't push.
Can we give this a try?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do that either.

Are you ready for more?
Just give it a chance.
Tom is upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I help it?
Tom is afraid of death.
I'm not able to fix the car by myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I'm not buying it.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Don't let anybody in.
Let's not get into that.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely got a raw deal.
He is second to none.
Nothing's wrong with me.
Tom is obviously sick.
I began to study English when I was twelve years of age. At that time I was interested in languages, but not excessively so. Now I can speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; and so it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I need a sincere girlfriend.
She is a beginner.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.

I'd leave.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you remember might help.
That's nothing you need to worry about.
I understand that they are a thorn in the eye to people like you, but this is simply pathetic.
Tom'll manage.
There's no free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do so much.
Friends, can I talk with you for a minute?
It's a fact of life.
We're lucky, aren't we?
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
One learns by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom is the one you want.
They won't take it away.
There is no rule without exception.
You may need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
All is quiet again.
I've failed.
Tom goes to school for graphic design.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
You should face up to the reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want you to talk to Tom about that.
This should do the trick.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It's just what happens.
Have some.
Speak about others as you would want them to speak about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I say it's OK.
Whatever do you mean?
You changed my life.
Reaction is not always the best course of action.
I won't tell anybody that you did that.

This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Recall the filename before you try to perform file recovery.
I'm trying to be cautious.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.

Why are you doing this to yourself?
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Have you got a dog?
I tried to talk Tom into coming home.
I'd be up for that.
Don't quibble.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Is Tom getting a raw deal?
Give me all your money.
Mary was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to get an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I'm not good at Latin.

I am waiting my turn.
I felt very troubled by the news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom requested help.
They know you.
I passed every single test.
It's no good waiting for something to happen; you must take action at once.

Even if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this by parcel post?
What is it you propose?
I don't have any homework today.
I've just been too busy.
Were you talking about me?
The sky became darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did all we could do.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
Some strange people keep knowledge of a language secret.
I have no intention of changing.
They moved ahead slowly.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't stare.
Blue suits you well.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom is worried about what might happen.
He was an honest man.
My father doesn't like soccer.
We're all out of booze.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
There was something lying on the ground.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think that Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you going to do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
Tom still seems anxious.
I haven't seen a thing.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Tom has no such problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You have a hard day ahead of you.
It's fine.
Does this mean that you love me?
It really is quite bad.
I'll pass.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Justice must be done.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay in tonight.
I thought Tom was awesome.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
I support your comments wholeheartedly.
I'll try to persuade Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we have an agreement?
Let's talk in the hall.
Could you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom took off that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't do it either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I see your ticket?
Be careful. This knife is really sharp.
It's clear.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typo.
Your book is double the size of mine.
We're both not as rich as we wish we were.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has unruly hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's the one I hate.
We will miss you terribly if you leave Japan.
Tell me what'll happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look at it.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit that I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs have you written?

This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we can figure this out.
We all must stand up against this.
I'm not sure when Tom will get back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our chairman came up with a good idea, which we have made into a great plan.
I just want to get something to eat.
I'm so tired, I can hardly keep my eyes open.
Pass me the sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever uploaded a video to YouTube?

Don't let Tom know that.

Come here a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.

I don't know why my head hurts.
I'm guessing you already know the answer to that.

Tom wasn't as handsome as Mary said he was.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother named John.
I'd accept.
They'll know what to do.
Why were you silent all the time?
He took off his clothes.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid that I dislocated my right shoulder.
You do need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
Drive slowly.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.
Did you do anything?
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
I could use a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a huge success.
Sit back down, please.
Does that happen a lot?
A little bird told me.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well enough.
I'm glad people saw it.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Get everything.
I resigned.
Everything's wrong.
Everything's ruined.

You deserve to be congratulated.
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of doing that.
Could you pass me the water, please?
Where I am doesn't matter.
Where did you go to in Japan?
Everybody left.
I'm going to study harder.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do that.
And you wonder why we can't stand being around you anymore?
You've misspelled my name.
You're different.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
His girlfriend was not supportive.
I wasn't interested in it.
Some of them were and are in constant danger due to political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still believe the Internet is not a place for children.
That was tough for me.
What have you concluded?
You were meant for me.
He needs her.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done yet?
I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom isn't fussy.
Control yourselves.
Tell her.
I'd accept.
You are my happiness.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
Several trees blew down in our neighborhood during the storm.
I'm sure I've seen her before somewhere.
Everybody smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He declined to comment.
We try.
I'm quitting.
Tom seemed a bit angry.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh yes! Tomorrow I will have something to do.

That morning Mary went round the whole village.
The rumour quickly spread.
Am I so different?
Tom took out his key and opened the door.
I've only just arrived.
What Tom did helped quite a bit.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not at all worried.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we nearly there?
I am not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Does that make you angry?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Fees are about to go up.
Was I really that happy?

Are you guys doing well?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom carried the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Have you seen it work?
Is that a yes or no?
Don't smile.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.

Tom isn't going to be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
I'm going to go take a nap.
What else could I have done?
Stay away from my woman.

I just want to get away.
Why do you think so?
Little children like to touch everything.
She curled her hair with curlers.
He is exempt from the military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge sets us free and makes us better people.
I didn't want to bring you in.
Are we safe now?
Who out of your friends will come?
Could you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom dance many times.
You tried.
I'm taking you dancing.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She is making a mountain out of a molehill.
You told me not to lie.
He was a member of a social elite rather than the masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a wealthy man.
I'm glad that you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pencil.
Just tell Tom I called.

Have you finished washing the dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom'll pay.
Hunting season is over.
I love Kabyle cooking.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.

I'm gonna go take a nap for an hour.
I'm quite happy now.
He was first subjected to a preliminary test with the new electronic breathalyzer before he was sent for a laboratory test.

It was a stressful day.
Is it clean?
Are those your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom watched from nearby.

That's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that isn't true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you bring work home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you based now?
It's quite likely that FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a conflicting answer.
Tell Tom that I'm ready.
She is wearing a gold necklace around her neck.
I'm very proud of that.
Atatürk was born in 1881, Thessaloniki
At least Tom is honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Have you told Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's just five in the morning, but nevertheless it is light out.
I hate mathematics.
What does your aunt do?
If it exists, a crossover with it will eventually happen.
Tom has a good command of French.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I know that this is strange.
He never recovered from the death of his son.
I'm only doing my duty.
Everyone sat back down.
If you've got nothing else to do, then count the Greek islands.
She always wears flashy clothes.
Does that about do it?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm real proud of Tom.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
This is going to take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The devotees of Vishnu are called Vaishnavas; the devotees of Shiva are Shaivites.
Tom would like to know whether you would like to come to his party.
You've grown.
I completely lost my train of thought
I've never regretted doing that.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Romani?
Tom came to meet me yesterday afternoon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom is still on the job.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you don't act like a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known it all along.
"I think perfection is ugly", he said. "Somewhere in the things that humans make, I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are those your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not a hundred percent sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd like to buy that one.
That is going too far.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't speak.
It hasn't been too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom is a bookworm.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're nice to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
It seems to be working.
I do not live to eat, but eat to live.
Tom looked very puzzled.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P".
My wedding has to be perfect.
Step aside.
We should study.
We don't have any other options.
In this kind of weather, it's best to stay home and not go outside.
I think that Tom is hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on powers of observation, Tom was unable to describe any of the pictures hanging on his living room wall, despite having lived in his unit for two years.
It's a pretty good one.
I was certainly lucky.
Everyone's holding their breath.
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories are there in that sandwich?
Are you prepared to take responsibility?
I love watching you work.
Hopefully we too will go to Beijing.
You're my inspiration.
I restrained myself from commenting on my beloved friend this time.
I'd agree.
Take care.
Did anyone phone me?
We'll eat lunch together at 12:30.
I'm still kind of tired.
To strive for maximization of self interest, happiness or security seems very natural for a human being.
I can do it with my eyes closed.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
Sorry I'm late.
Translating is not nearly as easy as many people might think.
Tom would never admit that.
That was just the beginning.
Is your homework finished?
Is everything OK between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was excellent.
I have to plan everything.
Let's drop the subject.
We counted the growth rings on the tree that we cut down and found out that it was thirty years old.
See you around, Tom.
Do you want fruit juice?
Let's set up a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get one?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
Boston is a great town.
We hope people like it.
They may leave tomorrow.
Come here. I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That is intriguing.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Bring help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his mother every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you give us a hand?
Would you take it easy?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could've gone, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of being Serbian, part of a group whose greatest historical achievements have been slaughtering authority figures and genocides?
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
Huh? Where'd I put the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom has lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
Tom will take a look at it.
I was wondering if anyone could help me. I have a mobile phone that only displays an error message.
I'm astonished.
Everybody smiled.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
A friend of mine can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Where can I find the tourist's office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written my part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come to see me tomorrow.
It was kind of strange.
I enjoyed myself a lot.
No one has died... yet.
Can we humans digest grass and obtain nourishment from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Won't you have another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Am I being fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
It's fine.
I don't mean to nag you.
Tell me what'll happen.
Tom has seen enough.
Are we starting soon?
They sell sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for the help.
What did both of you do?
Happy birthday!
Nature photos of animals taken in complete tranquility and serenity are truly masterpieces.
My mother died the same day I got married.
I won't ever mention this again.
You are not allowed to go into that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom is careful.
The White family will arrive in Tokyo at ten thirty.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy yourself.
Let me write down the steps for you.
Tom is probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute no matter what she wears.
Look out!
Tom couldn't produce any evidence to back his statement up.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad attitude.
I was just heading out.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a real bad day.
The whole country is talking about it.
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does she love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm restless.
I was happy yesterday.
Tom could tell by the way Mary slammed the door that she was upset.
Now is not a very good time.
He is no longer a child.
I try to air my futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Anywhere I go, I am there.
Do you want in on this?
Put the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Get everything.
You've tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I've seen just now that the ambassador of Saudi Arabia has resigned.
Take care.
There may be something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You are the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We're here for the day.
You know I can't give out that kind of information.
I'm not the one who did that.
I'll check.
Tom was taken aback.
Just one moment, please.
We can get one for you.
Tom still seems shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(Not P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That is an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than he usually does.
I could eat a horse.
I've never actually ever met Tom.
Which one is easier?
Tom put in for a raise.
I've never noticed that before.
This should do the trick.
I always liked Tom better.
Where has Tom been hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on the way to work.
I've got some brownies.
Take a look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're being ridiculous.
Are Tom and Mary really engaged?
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories tells, among other things, how Christianity was spread in Norway by force.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students didn't know how they should answer.
I'll try to persuade Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I tripped.
I assumed that you were busy.
That elegant gold plated chain with hearts is a necklace that will "rock your world".
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
A heavy rain fell.
There is milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're being irrational.
I'm furious.
The official dinner took place at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can save yourself a lot of trouble by just doing it right the first time.
Marie jumped from the window into the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave Tom that.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Can Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm having a blast.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Mary always walk hand in hand.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom is trying to be helpful.
I've missed so many opportunities.
It's been a great help.
Give me another example.
Tom still has some time.
Baseball is boring.
Tom has been most than generous.
I was just playing for time.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What're you going to do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you almost here?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look at the size of it!
We have to do the shopping.
Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what that is.
Let's hope Tom is smart.
I always have fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to work for us.
I'm lucky.
I'll stand.
We recommend that mains water have a water-quality test carried out once a year, well water twice a year.
Dear God, people really find it difficult when they have to point out one thing or another about you, such as your attitudes or your appearance.
What? What did you say?
Tom could do better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel as if I've been thrown into oblivion.
Do you guys get along?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still here?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
"Yes, orange juice please," says Mike.
I'm not coming along.
Take care.
May I interrupt you a while?
The students didn't know how to give an answer.
It's the thought that counts.
I've already thought about that.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking.
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
We don't know for sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability means compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not that way.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students came to the meeting.
My mother isn't like other mothers.
He canceled the appointment at the last moment.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's fine.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
What did you do it for?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Check again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe Maria is best suited to take over as leader. But Tom will abstain from voting.
I'm sure you'll do well.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Step aside.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be vigilant.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who will come with us?
It sounds like you learned a valuable lesson.
We've never been apart.
I'm thirty.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that instant it exploded with a great noise.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population is supplied with potable water from surface water sources.
What is she drinking?
Tom is quite mean.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read it?
That's perfectly normal.
It is said that a new restaurant was constructed.
The cost of the book is five dollars.
Are you good at keeping secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he was dead asleep.
I have never thought of that.
Keep it down in there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand it.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
I'm really curious.
Tom's double-parked.
Good morning. How are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What do you want to do about Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands in the sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
I haven't seen a thing.
Are there any other possibilities?
The payment for labor and return on invested capital was several millions.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'm not doing it alone.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
I don't completely agree with you.
Are you saving this seat for someone?
How have you been doing?
A week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Will you be at Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea has risen, the sea of peoples.
Tom said he's no expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
No wonder Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I've written anyone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom shut off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Have you written your report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Could you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours at a stretch.
I hope that I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four French classes a week.
Let's start right away.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've trained for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Sami is our only hope.
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was the type of presentation which appeals to the audience.
Let me tell you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom is out of practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's a quarter to two.
I think you should take the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained an advantage over all other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I had to eat yesterday.
Tom is never here in the morning.
Even children know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me so angry.
Is it still light out?
I'm not hiding from anybody.
Many birds are on the branch.
I don't have a cellphone anymore.
I assumed that you were busy.
Is that agreeable?
I recognized him at first glance.
That is very nice of you.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom was able to get into the house through a window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You've tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs and potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a couch potato.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom is a nerd.
The future looked bleak for Edmond Dantes after he became the victim of a conspiracy, and he was convicted for treason and imprisoned for life.
You're being irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we wish we were.
Could you tell Tom that I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of those.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I taught myself French.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You are one of us.
He's got one foot in the grave.
Tom told me just the opposite.
Speak up!
I'm not unsympathetic.
Tom is displeased.
That would be a treat.
He is as nutty as a fruitcake.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang for you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me in the least.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I had slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom looked a bit sick.
I will contact you as soon as I arrive.
I'm glad.
It looks quite different around here than it used to.
Why are rabbits' ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help out.
I know how to do that.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom really is an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I've got my eye on you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That one is very rare.
What did I just do?
The best way is to take things as they come.
This one's pretty cool.
I enjoyed it very much.
I bought lots of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife is from Kedah.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river seems shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this essay.
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
That's quite a secret.
Mary said that she would reveal all of her employer's secrets if he did not raise her wage.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Come out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a while longer.
I'm not going to do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She is a singer.
I love watching you dance.
I was certainly lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom may chicken out.
I just want to get away.
Don't let such a good opportunity go by.
Take care.
He is in his first year at college.
I asked for grape juice.
I thought about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My fluency is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my — often contradictory — emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often experience palpitations of the heart.
Tom is on a top secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm scared of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry to always be bothering you.
He is a man of power.
Terrific!
I'm ticklish.
Can you give us a lift?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How can we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon. What type of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
I'll be right upstairs.
We've got to take off.
Tom is a very nice boy.
Tom is upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most eighteen-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right thigh bone in a bicycling accident Sunday in France.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
It sounds simple, I know.
Tom looked very puzzled.
The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
The tires squealed.
Are you fully recovered?
I'll obey.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
The incident happened to be captured on video by a bystander.
Did I drop that?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known that Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's futile.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's home is in Connecticut, while the right side is in New York.
There are some indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be a bit more subdued this year.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
You owe me big time.
He is a man of few words.
I'm very sorry about this.
Tom came over to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's so true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one of those.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom was out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom comes to visit us every now and then.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
I exaggerated.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put his book down.
This should do the trick.
You shouldn't judge a man by his appearance.
That's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for your email!
I pretended that I didn't know what was happening.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea that I'd be here.
Tom told me that he won't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
A team is only as strong as its weakest member.
I've already been there.
That is different than what I had expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The children are asleep.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom slid the door shut.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
It is time for kids to go to sleep.
Tom worked very hard and earned a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
The first stage is complete.
You will be famous.
He has money enough and to spare.
We're so glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You are the most boring person I know.
Tom knew that it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm wounded.
Tom stayed with us for several days.
Is French taught at your school?
Get a picture of this.
Who lives in the house next door?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom'll recover.
For me, it is important.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The tires squealed.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black colours.
I'm a bit worried now.
Do you have a steady boyfriend?
Tom can still recite a poem he wrote when he was thirteen.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be watchful.
How would you translate it?
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
It was a hard decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope we have fine weather tomorrow.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.
Tom does seem familiar.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom saved all of the letters Mary sent him.
Take Tom for a swim.
It's safer.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's wardrobe isn't complete without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped save me a few bucks by telling me about a cheaper place to buy one.
You can't do anything other than admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked all his life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom'll live.
You've won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with children.
I will be late.
You can't buy apples any more!
There's a lot of traffic on the freeway.
You should write Tom a note.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
It doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Somebody needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you back within twenty minutes?
Little as we know about her origins, we can at least be sure that she is a pilot of Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom boarded the bus.
The deer is faster than it is strong.

I've decided.
Do you have a copy?
We are going to the cinema.
I wouldn't hurt her.
There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.

That only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure whether Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're leaving, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I don't know much about Australia.
Tom'll recover.
It's correct.
Let's be friends.
What are you going to do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.

We have our backs to the wall.
Check again.
Come with us, please.

It would be different.

I'm real proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

This is a straightforward case.

You're just wasting our time.
I'd like to know what's happening here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll make something up.
A man worthy of his salt cannot do such a thing.
Look out!
I won't try to predict the future.

Are they all strong?
Is it all resolved now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this all about?
Have a nice day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?

I'm not bitter at all.
Yumi is one of my friends.
It just took some time.
I thought Tom wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Mary started taking her clothes off.
As above, so below.
Life without love is just totally pointless.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
I'm firmly opposed to this.
You underestimate me.

I'm surprised by Tom's response.
Everyone's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where is your father?
I'd agree.
Everything stopped.
The book is out of print.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
Tom needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At a first glance it seems easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I have no doubt that he will succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I have no intention of changing.
Tom started the car.
My paternal grandmother enjoys tea ceremonies.
She smiled.
They deceived all.

Are you being sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She walks.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you both do?
Make a sketch of your house.
Tom set his drink down.
I'm quite shocked by this.
The pantry is empty.
Tom decided against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
Don't respond.
If you did that for me, it would help a lot.

I'm very sorry about this.
You're being ridiculous.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too noisy here for me.

Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still kind of tired.
We can't go back there.
We will visit you occasionally.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted to do.
His remark is open to misunderstanding.
