Tom reads to his daughter.
My computer is expensive.
Smoke appeared.
Tom worked at a hospital.
I remember.
Keep reading.
Keep going.
Stay focused.
Sit still.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask anyone.
Look closer.
Take cover!
We're still the best.
Stop fighting!
That worked.
Keep quiet.
Come inside.
Tom is clearly upset.
Tom flinched.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Tom inhaled.
Take command.
Tom doesn't want to be seen talking to you.
Everybody left.
Come home.
I still believe you cheated me.
All I want is a chance to say I'm sorry.
Drive carefully.
She disappeared.
Drive faster.
I don't want to go to school.
Be kind.
Hold it!
You're so intense.
I improvised.
Sit there.
How many years have you lived here?
Tom danced.
Never mind!
They lied.
Tom jumped.
My mother is at home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay still.
Step back.
Of course.
How beautiful!
Do you think I should do this?
Unbelievable!
Nobody knows.
Put your gloves on.
What's your number?
Nice shot!
Tom didn't go into detail.
Look out!
Please stop.
Tom hesitated.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom sighed.
They vanished.
I can't stand to think about it.
Be punctual.
Are you going to go on holiday this year?
Come in.
Move over.
That aircraft company deals in freight only.
Tom drowned.
By the way, where are you from?
Tom told me he didn't take French in high school.
Sit tight.
Look here.
Get out.
Anybody home?
I'm sorry I took so long.
I punched Tom in the face.
I disagree.
Keep dancing.
Ignore Tom.
Tom waved.
I feel like sleeping all day.
Find Tom.
Tom gave Mary a ride home.
Women change the world.
Louder, please.
Tell her that I am sleeping.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
Everyone laughed.
She's afraid of the dark.
I'm not quite sure yet.
Fill the pot with water.
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
Loosen it.
Someone coughed.
Stop that!
It was vague.
Do as I asked.
That won't change anything.
I don't understand that at all.
Keep practicing.
Taste this.
How thrilling!
Tom should've asked Mary for help.
Keep searching.
Keep walking.
Can you tell me who is coming tonight?
Enjoy yourself!
Sit still.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
Stop reading.
Stay focused.
Get serious.
Drive safely.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Stop reading.
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
I believe that you will succeed.
Come over.
One day, you will understand.
Look away.
How interesting!
Please relax.
What kind of books does Tom read?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three campgrounds in this area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow.
Continue digging.
Wonderful!
Get changed.
Coffee, please.
He speaks really well.
Please sit.
Look around.
Examine it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Have you been listening to me?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
It is a bird.
All aboard!
Take everything.
Come over.
You tried.
Leave me.
The apple is on the table.
Tom is bragging about his new car.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
Say nothing.
Watch yourselves.
How can you not know?
Take command.
How curious!
They sweated.
Continue working.
Tom clapped.
I've always wanted to read that book.
Me, too.
Everybody laughed.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
It was terrific.
She walks.
Return immediately.
Wood floats.
Get out.
Loosen it.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
What are you stopping for?
Shove over.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
When do you shop?
They won.
My mother is at home.
Tom got killed in a freak accident.
Things changed.
I resigned.
When do you shop?
Tom recovered.
How does this thing work?
Help yourself.
Stop trying.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Leave it.
This is not important.
I stayed home for a week.
I began living by myself.
Hold this.
Kiss me.
We are opposed to war.
Tom hesitated to discuss the subject with Mary.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Be prepared.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Tom laughed.
Time flies.
We forgot.
I need to see Tom now.
Say hello.
They started hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
Keep cool.
Drive carefully.
Try this.
Anyone home?
Be reasonable.
Keep walking.
Don't wait for us.
Quit gambling.
Follow him.
I try.
Tom needs something.
Replace it.
When do you shop?
Come quick!
Come home.
Sit down!
Terrific!
Look again.
Who should we give it to?
Stand up!
Stay there.
I spoke to Tom last night.
Keep trying.
Can you stop yelling?
Stop reading.
They swam.
They called.
Tom doesn't pay much attention to how he dresses.
It happens.
We were up front.
Tom and Mary walked down the busy sidewalk.
I can't be late.
We survived.
We work together.
Lie still.
Say goodbye.
Let me do my work in peace.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep warm.
Think again.
We forgot.
We failed.
Ladies first.
I am not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day, you will understand.
At that time a primitive people lived there.
Stop it.
Tom gloated.
Unbelievable!
Move quietly.
I see.
Tell me.
Look around.
Stop squabbling.
Tom has come to help us.
I fainted.
Grab that.
Stop them.
Start over.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
Sign this.
Defend yourself.
Stop apologizing.
Everything matters.
Be punctual.
Hang on!
Don't wait for us.
Stuff happens.
Everyone screamed.
Let's stop beating around the bush and cut to the chase.
Tom chuckled.
She brushed away the dust.
The temperature has fallen below zero this morning.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
Be yourself.
Be calm.
They waited.
Tell everybody.
Ask anybody.
What do you suggest I do?
Come in.
We learn by experience.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
Watch yourself.
They danced.
Start writing.
Get down!
Drop it!
They walked.
Just tell me why you're really here.
Look closely.
Tom blinked.
Shut up!
This is my choice.
Tom reads French better than I do.
Show me.
Tom fainted.
Grab this.
Tom fought.
Tom agrees.
Watch carefully.
This will be easy.
Well done!
Tom moaned.
Anybody hurt?
Stop pushing.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Sing along.
Ask Tom.
I promise.
Nobody answered.
Not bad.
Sleep tight.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom has never been to my house.
Step forward.
Stop lying.
You're entitled to your opinion.
It's great fun.
Take care.
Continue working.
Stop it.
Sure I can, although I can't really speak Shanghainese.
I contributed.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be fair.
When did you tell me?
Be sensible.
Tom is a very private man.
Tom agreed.
We failed.
There is a tall man in the classroom.
I'll watch TV.
Wait beside the car for me!
Tom tried to speak French to the saleslady.
Even if we end up being late, it doesn't bother us.
Ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
How horrible!
You should know that I'm in love with Mary.
I disagree.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Come over.
Keep back.
Listen.
Does this sound stupid?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch up with my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Settle down!
I waited.
Something changed.
Tom is a runaway.
We waited.
Wow!
Everybody knew.
Sleep tight.
This box contains five apples.
I disagree.
Tom begged us to be patient.
I believed that he had no right to do that.
Tom chuckled.
Ignore Tom.
That'll change nothing.
Nobody volunteered.
I should be able to do something about that.
Come in.
Ignore them.
Many of the workers had missing fingers.
Keep searching.
They cheered.
Keep paddling.
Can you speak French?
Watch us.
I can't take it any more.
Eat something.
Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died.
Tom kneeled.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Study hard.
Join us.
Tom swims better than Mary does.
Turn right.
Get real!
Start again.
Everybody smiled.
I need to know how this happened.
Keep it.
Let us tell you why we came.
Thanks anyway.
Yes.
Tom is with his mother.
Stay away.
They disappeared.
She was in a hurry to go home.
Quiet down.
You can't make it without me.
Please come.
I deserve more.
Hand it to me.
Please continue.
You were supposed to wait.
Step aside.
It helps.
I need to see Tom now.
Forget him.
The weather is good today.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Stop crying.
Please sing.
Memorize this.
I have not yet learned whether he reached there or not.
You're so intense.
Tom disappeared.
Nobody came.
What are you stopping for?
Oh no!
Tom answered.
Wake up!
Tom called the neighbors.
Walk slowly.
See you at school.
Catch him.
Tom and Mary are the only ones still in the room.
Kiss me.
Examine this.
Exercise outdoors.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Smile.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thanks.
Who cares?
Leave tomorrow.
Stand up!
Say please.
It stinks.
We try.
Tom can go hear Mary sing at that club whenever he wants to.
Tom liked Australia.
Take action.
The tree is green.
Quiet down.
Read this.
Be content.
It was vague.
Stay back.
Stay quiet.
I think I left something in the classroom.
One day, you will understand.
Do as I asked.
I panicked.
That works.
Stay sharp.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Tom cried.
Stop here.
Flowers bloom.
Stop lying.
Hand me the briefcase.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Get inside.
Tom wants a new car.
Hold this.
Somebody intervened.
Mary giggled.
Start singing.
Answer me.
That worked.
We forgot.
Oh, hush!
Step back.
Please sit.
Who cares?
One language is never enough.
They understood.
Listen.
Tom came back inside the room.
I still believe you cheated me.
Keep working.
No problem.
Finish this.
Tom coughed.
There are some children playing in the park.
Think again.
When do you shop?
Memorize it.
It's not barcoded.
Why are we running?
Cuff him.
Everyone smiled.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
Tom fought.
Dogs bark.
We promised.
It happened.
Sit here.
Calm down.
Tom suggested that I go to a movie with Mary.
Get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it.
Anything else?
Hello, Tom.
Be confident.
Years passed.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If aspirin will ease my headache, I will take a couple tonight instead of this horrible medicine.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't mean.
Look here.
Hello, world!
I've never eaten horsemeat.
Let's stop beating around the bush and cut to the chase.
Do you want to see what I just made?
We survived.
Be cool.
Loosen up.
They kissed.
Tom and I'll go together.
Marry me.
You'd better go home as soon as possible.
I hear that Tom Jackson is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
Excuse me.
Stop grumbling.
They approve.
That's your opinion.
Fill the pot with water.
You're the leader.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Healthy food is essential for a healthy body and a healthy mind, and as a result, promotes maximum efficiency.
Hurry up.
He believed in the truth.
Tom looked.
Champagne, please.
Stay here.
I'm not going into details.
Stay down!
Everyone prayed.
All started to laugh.
Tom blushed.
Nobody asked.
Look alive.
Hello, Tom.
Please smile.
Be fair.
See you at work.
Tell Tom.
Keep notes.
Sign this.
Look there.
Keep that.
I live in Yerevan.
I'll come by car.
Take these.
You run.
Stay cool.
You do nothing else but eat.
Don't do it, Tom.
Examine them.
Ignore them.
They walked.
She got married last year.
Tom linked to my website from his blog.
Stand still!
Leave everything.
This is my choice.
Tom disappeared.
Let us tell you why we came.
You run.
Well, that's different.
Please sing.
Did you stay here all night?
You'd better back off.
Be punctual.
Loosen up.
I doubt that's what really happened.
Tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it.
Stand aside.
Keep them.
Nobody cares.
Stay away.
Come back.
Come in for a minute.
Sing along.
Tom had often heard about Mary, but hadn't yet met her.
Hang on!
Leave Tom.
Leave Tom.
Stop pushing.
Turtles don't have teeth.
She disappeared.
Step aside.
Tom listened.
Tom wanted to sleep late, but was unable to.
Never mind!
Start here.
Stop laughing.
Be friendly.
Be prepared.
Tom gasped.
Tom clapped.
How many years have you lived here?
Does this sound stupid?
Can you speak French?
Keep warm.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Stay here.
That's really impressive.
I don't know.
Mary ran.
Try again.
I overslept.
I understand.
Forget Tom.
Thank you.
Grab him.
Be seated.
Keep quiet!
Start writing.
Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
Be quiet.
Things changed.
Ask Alex.
There are always options.
You were supposed to wait.
Memorize this.
I quit.
Are you trying to be funny?
Stay here.
That helped.
Where are you from?
Keep digging.
I miss you.
Stop arguing.
I misunderstood.
Loosen up.
Tom can go hear Mary sing at that club whenever he wants to.
It's cold.
Stop it.
I didn't need Tom.
I had finished my homework when you called me.
Do you have plans tonight?
I'm not tired.
Go ahead!
How curious!
Get ready.
Tom gloated.
What is your favorite bird?
Tom is an extremely good-looking man.
Call us.
What do you think of going to a movie?
Memorize this.
These things aren't mine!
We lost.
Take mine.
Call me.
She cried.
How interesting!
Who died?
Stop here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Ignore Tom.
Sit down!
Eat slowly.
I will try again.
Tom left.
We forgot.
Tom should thank me.
Hurry back.
Drive slowly.
Please hurry.
Be nice.
Calm down.
Be patient.
Everyone survived.
Stop babbling.
She tried.
Cheer up!
Speak clearly.
Stop whining.
Who knows?
Sit there.
I like apples best.
I am studying.
Do you have a more detailed map?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked Mary in the eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The bread is fresh.
I want Tom killed.
Tom died.
Please specify any conditions you have for the use of this information.
Be sensible.
After you.
I just ignore them.
What's Tom reading?
Look ahead.
Stay still.
I can do the math.
Keep cool.
Defend yourselves.
Be patient.
Everyone dreams.
Congratulations!
Take Tom to the hospital.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
Forgive me.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Examine this.
Move over.
Finish this.
Return fire.
Are there any more details?
Tom is much stronger today.
Open fire!
Can I leave a message, please?
Take mine.
Please come and get me.
It'll be wonderful.
I'm drinking milk.
Drive on.
I can't be late.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we'll have to begin.
Stay down!
Tom dozed.
Tom can't accept your gift.
Tom used to hate Boston.
That hurts.
Everything changed.
Tom could hear his name being called.
Stay away.
Tom died.
Stop resisting!
He glanced at his watch.
Speak up!
Ask around.
Wood burns.
Release him.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Be respectful.
Stop squabbling.
I can't let you do this.
Please don't use my name.
Cheer up!
Stop looking at that girl.
Are they doing anything right now?
Seventy or eighty years is the normal span of a man's life.
Forgive me.
Call me.
Hurry home.
Sit tight.
Stay down!
Stop moving!
Anybody home?
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Take precautions.
Speak up!
Take over.
Tell Tom.
Have I missed something?
Tom knows.
It snowed.
You can't make it without me.
Stop overreacting.
Tell everybody.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Is it OK if I sit here?
Keep writing.
Tom thought he was being cute.
I apologize.
Stay sharp.
Keep trying.
Hurry back.
Excuse me.
The decision has been made.
My knife is sharp.
I'm the one who let Tom get away.
I understood.
That's true, too.
I drink tea, too.
Tom stood there, waiting to cross the busy road.
All I want is a chance to say I'm sorry.
Be calm.
I can't remember what I ate last night.
Examine it.
Ask Tom about it.
Do you think I should do this?
Tom escaped.
Hold fire.
They obeyed.
Tom is bragging about his new car.
Get changed.
Time flew.
Tom would have liked to attend Mary's party. Unfortunately, he had other things he had to do.
Take these.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
How deep?
Start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom grinned.
I overslept.
Release him.
Let's get a little closer.
Skip it.
Stop apologizing.
Do I have a knife?
Step aside.
Tom quit.
Tom won.
Tom yawned.
Stay positive.
We hope to arrive on time.
Tom advised Mary to leave as soon as possible.
Stay focused.
Tom will kill again.
Keep fighting.
Tell me.
Memorize it.
Listen carefully.
That helped.
You're talkative.
Keep out.
Take it.
Tom worked at a hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details won't be published.
Everyone screamed.
Welcome to Wikipedia.
Does anybody know if the cafeteria is still open?
The woman is in the room.
Catch him.
Tom is trying hard to give up smoking.
Keep running.
She wants to drink some warm milk.
Please wait.
Help me.
Are they doing anything right now?
What?
I like to feel sad. I know that most people try to avoid any kind of sad feeling. But I think that is wrong.
Turn around.
I must translate the sentences.
How tragic!
Everyone waited.
How strange!
Cool down.
Stay down!
Don't quibble about the details.
That worked.
Be creative.
Choose carefully.
Keep still.
How cute!
I confessed.
You need to sign that.
Stay alert.
Come forward.
I don't care what you do with it.
Please reconsider.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
Everybody cheered.
Get lost.
Tom is extremely creative.
Stand up!
Do you have any objection to this plan?
Ask around.
Tom failed.
Hello, Tom.
I sympathize.
Be discreet.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
I love you.
Be yourself.
I need that tape.
We apologize.
You'd better back off.
They screamed.
Let's get a picture of us together for my mom.
Please hurry.
I have two cats.
Say nothing.
Please stop.
How unfortunate!
We'll have a great time in Boston.
I lost.
He ran.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be attentive.
Be quiet.
Humor me.
Nobody died.
Tom helped.
Take this.
Seize him!
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was still just a boy.
What do you suggest I do?
Contact Tom.
Get started.
Stop yelling.
Won't somebody please help me?
Can you speak French?
Release him.
Sign here.
Have you ever been to America?
Hold on.
Tom flinched.
Be attentive.
Don't go out after dark.
Tom volunteered.
Why did you stop me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Keep quiet.
I don't know anything about this.
I fainted.
Thanks.
He accelerated.
Watch me.
Good evening.
What's wrong with me?
Settle down!
Thank God.
Take it upstairs.
Tom said that he'd be a few minutes late.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Stay close.
Cool off!
I don't have time to talk with you anymore.
I can't stop thinking about what happened.
Come back.
Tom cried.
Stop talking.
Tom exhaled.
Stop worrying.
Keep down.
Get away!
Chris is very attractive and wealthy, but not very modest.
Sweet dreams!
Choose carefully.
How cute!
Say nothing.
Wow!
That worked.
Tom drinks.
Mama cried.
How old is your dog?
Tom escaped.
I like the Occitan language.
Tom grumbled.
Stop arguing.
Shove over.
Do you have a dictionary?
Wash up.
They yelled.
Get up.
Google Translate can't translate phrases or give definitions of individual words.
Go ahead.
Help me.
What is your favorite bird?
We volunteered.
Grab Tom.
Take action.
They lost.
Grab him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
It gave her quite a shock, and she didn't want to talk about anything for a while. I think it'll be a while before she's back to normal.
Keep cool.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom doesn't know how to say what he wants to say in English.
Be respectful.
Tom says it's OK.
Mr Yoshida is at home in French history.
Happy anniversary!
Follow Tom.
Stop complaining.
Grab that.
Hello!
Can you stop yelling?
Work slowly.
We have all the details.
Keep writing.
Stop worrying.
Come here.
I am studying.
Stop laughing.
I can't imagine such a life.
Stand back!
Thank you all for coming.
Tom listened.
Write me.
Have you been listening to me?
That worked.
We're going to have fun.
Watch me.
I don't have any details.
Take Tom.
Tom grinned.
It happened.
Stop pushing.
Keep moving.
Tom called.
They burned.
Leave us.
Wake up!
Nobody listens.
Tom drives.
They understood.
Take this.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
Pardon me?
Be still.
I don't care how much it costs. I'm going to buy it anyway.
Things change.
Watch yourselves.
Hold this.
We know.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
Stop whining.
They cheat.
This isn't easy.
Call home!
They relaxed.
Who did you send roses to?
Take cover!
Have fun.
Tom baked a cake for Mary.
We overslept.
Join us.
Identify yourself.
I am happiest when I am reading.
This stinks.
Pardon me?
Tom isn't homeless.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
Tom wasn't happy to see Mary there.
I drink tea, too.
Try again.
I agree.
Please continue.
Please listen.
I resigned.
Get down!
This works.
How many more of you are there?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what he's up against.
She seems happy to be here.
The man sitting over there is a famous singer.
Call us.
I absolutely cannot approve the proposition.
I find Tom very easy to talk to.
Somebody called.
Things break.
This is a horse.
I've known Jim since I was a child.
You need to sign that.
I thought he was coming.
Tom cheated.
He came.
She walks.
Who should we give it to?
Look out!
Tom said he would help me.
Stop complaining.
I confessed.
Turn left.
Come on!
Keep down.
Really?
Why are they so mean to us?
Stop shooting.
Keep walking.
I don't like silence.
Look out!
You're not good at this.
Be merciful.
Come on!
Say something.
Stand by.
Tom wants a new car.
Pace yourself.
Tom saw Mary earlier this week.
Quiet, please.
There is a man working on the farm.
Hand me the briefcase.
