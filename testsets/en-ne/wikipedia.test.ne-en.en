If the research problem is not clear then review of literature can help focus on the problem.
It is used to prepare the objective report of the study.
Disease is diagnosed based on this and medicine prescribed.
Knowledge is different from different variables because it is mentioned and preserved in the past and it increases with time.
Unpublished sources include research report, unpublished articles, letters, records and manuscripts.
On the other hand, inquisitive people see problems everywhere and sees the need of their solutions.
Problem of choice is the main subject matter of economics.
This problem of economics is called the basis of origin of economics.
Totality in economics, psychology, education and sociology are of this type.
In research of economics there is a practice of stating the assumptions.
Good assumptions must have the following characteristic - It should be proveable
This section should include the summary of all materials studied and also the things that one wants to add.
Before we question, we need to do a little or more research regarding it.
This section can be detailed or brief based on the subject matter.
We can even use YouTube from the internet.
For example, if the subject matter of economics is economic activity then its threshold is non-economic activity.
For example the no. of all students in a school is the total population.
For example if the research problem is to study the effects of income level on fertility then research title or problem can be -
For example, if the present drug cannot diagnose the disease than a new drug will be searched.
This can be explained by one example - Human needs are unlimited but the resources to fulfill them are limited.
How much literature to review depends on the scope and are of research, the reach and qualification of the researcher, etc.
If the needs are constant and resources changeable then as soon as resources are obtained, needs are fulfilled.
Because the researcher has to collect various books, journals,  audio, etc.
This is one type of prediction we have done on any topic based on the facts and information received from literature review.
Were there predictions before Newton's famous Gravitational theory and Einstein's  relativity theory?
Keynes found out the soulution of economical crisis and unemployment.
According to Kerlinger, the statement stating the relation between two or more variables is hypothesis.
After some exercises, the questions can be made by focusing on the research problem.
Some major methods and tools of analysis are as follows -
Does increase in income have a positive or a negative effect on fertility?
b) If the means are constant then the problem such as which means will full fill which necessity will arise.
Does the effect of the same increase in income between the rich and the poor have the same effect on their fertility?
Qualitative research usually uses primary data.
The more we research, the research problem will keep one getting  clearer.
Who ever elaborate the variables, that will be the pattern.
Those data that has already been used once and will be used second time as well, then those data are called secondary data.
Whatever the method is used, it must be uniformly used in all processes.
Every single unit of variable which is unequal is called unequal variable.
If the number assigned to a context is not certain then it is called unlimited context.
John West has said that the store of knowledge is in books and libraries for practical purposes.
Knowledge is infinite but never zero.
In the field of knowledge, our superiors have done at least something.
He proved that only one short run average cost curve touches the lowest point of long run average cost curve.
However it can be said that research work is hard to carry out without some hypothesis.
But the information obtained should be mentioned.
But if required, it can be described in a different section.
But sometimes the population is only imagined then such population is called imaginary population.
But if it is not clear, it can be further described and explained using a different title.
But literature review is important also while preparing research proposal.
The research should clarify the possible contribution to solving knowledge or practical problems.
That's why it is called research design or research framework.
Because these  statistics are fundamental and statistical there are very few errors and mistakes.
Therefore researcher should distinguish between the principal material and supporting material.
Instead of page number of the book, the  chapters and verse numbers are written.
Then they reached to the conclusion that God particle or Higgs-Boson particle causes weight to be formed.
Later, Marshall explained the difference between the investor and risk factor by giving the example of  a joint venture company.
The specialty of  pattern such as median can be said on this basis.
The statistical methodology of selection of sample is known as sampling.
In natural sciences, the theory of cause and effect is based on a variable assumption.
The use of hypothesis doesn't have much significance in the natural sciences.
Primary data are those data that the researcher is using by collecting and describing them for the first time.
That dispute led to the propagation of the theory of demand and supply of price determination.
The relationship between income level and reproduction rate can have the following research question -
These things should be kept in mind during the review of literature and collection of matter.
If the number of variables in a defined population is fixed then that is called limited population.
If this sentence is referenced from Kautilya's Economics, which...
If you want to create a boundary of your research, then you will have to define or explain it under different topic.
If there are  obstacles in situations that we are experiencing then that is a problem.
However, these variables may be expressed in mathematical terms, or they may not too.
Things such as cassettes, audio and video items fall under this category.
The following methods can be used under this: Mean, median, mode, average, etc.
According to this, there are the following sources of data -
There are many methods including APA and MLA. 
The following things should be kept in mind for this.
In this manner, some materials may be added or unnecessary materials may be discarded.
The effort to give a scientific form to this concept opens up the door for research.
The number of students that we want to study is called the defined total population.
It is written by arranging it with the subject matter and the source is kept in a bracket.
Such data cn be used to compare, test, to correct errors in previous research, or to propagate new theories.
We come across such problems in our everyday life but we move away from the problem.
These materials contribute to the following: a) gives research a definite form
Such totality can be limited, unlimited, homogeneous or heterogeneous.
Audio videos can be used in materials study but it should be protected as proof.
All these devices can be found from books of data.
The relation of demand with all these factors are complex so we assume all others to be constant and study the effect of one variable at a time.
Under this there can be varieties of shapes and specialities.
This is a kind of presumption or a principle that is not yet proven.
Every drop of blood has the same characteristics, like every little bit of a pot of rice is the same.
Population can be classified into three types for research study.
Since Research is an scientific field, this has to fulfill a specified steps and processes.
The research could have theoretical or practical importance.
Based on the nature and objective of the source, facts can be collected from published and unpublished sources.
Researchers can devise new instruments if the subject of the research is of different nature.
All the materials used during the preparation of research proposal should be mentioned respectively.
After the research proposal is presented the researcher shifts his attention towards collecting and studying more and more facts, figures and information in his field of study.
AS the research tittle is chosen you must quickly overview your research.
Regarding the description of the reference list, it should be mentioned in the prescribed format.
Some representative units taken from complex are called example, sample, representation or banki.
The beginning of the problem may starts from the situation we are experiencing.
The hypothesis and solution presented for problem solving.
The principle of light wave was invented after marine ships could not see light from lighthouse in some places.
The serious and comparative study of the concerned materials can amend or change the objectives of a researcher.
The following points should be considered while collecting the materials - a)  How important is the received material?
In social sciences, there may be various causes of a single incident.
General distribution, student t distribution, binary distribution and other distributions are all imaginary. 
In short, the inquisitiveness for human benefit is the research problem.
In short, creating a hypothesis depends on the nature of the problem.

Mutation has been defined in number of ways, yet the gist is that these are due to hereditary modifications.
Defining mutation it is stated that  mutation is generation of dynamic chemical change in genetic matter of any species.
Scientists have the availability of one such method of hybridization for mutation today, which they are using excessively.
Mutation is called as instantaneous and accidental genetic change.

Pradeep pulled my cycle while Ashish pulled Nabin's because we had pulled their cycles on our way here. 
Madan asked laughing: - "Your friend got angry or what?"
I made a master plan to wait int he classroom with the expectation the I will get to see her face when Laxmi and other come back.
Me and Nabin were facing west while seated and Ashish and Pradip were facing east.
“You speak in front of me but be afraid infront of him to say anything..” I added. 
I have understood.. I told Pradip to hop in with Nabin and I would ride the bike that Pradip rode.

About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi - arid.
A sand sheet is a near - level, firm expanse of partially consolidated particles in a layer that varies from a few centimeters to a few meters thick.
A semi - arid desert or a steppe is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity.
As the desert mountains decay, large areas of shattered rock and rubble occur.
As the mountains are eroded, more and more sand is created.
As this wind - induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly across the surface of the ground.
Being Ectotherms, reptiles are unable to live in cold deserts but are well - suited to hot ones.
Berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells.
Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.
Cacti are present in both north and South America with a post - gondwana origin.
Cold deserts, sometimes known as temperate deserts, occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts, and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air.
Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for Agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation.
Deserts, both hot and cold, play a part in moderating the earth's temperature.
Deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges.
Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night.
Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields.
During a sandstorm, the wind - blown sand particles become electrically charged.
Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder Granites, limestone and sandstone.
Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes.
European interest in the sahara desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land.
Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants.
Former Desert Areas Presently in non - arid environments, such as the sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts.
For these reasons, the front line moved back and forth through hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained momentum.
Humans have long made use of deserts as places to live, and more recently have started to exploit them for minerals and energy capture.
In Common with cacti, many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals.
In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live.
In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain.
In some parts of the world, deserts are created by a rain shadow effect.
In the first part of the night, as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day, they emerge and search for prey.
In the köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as bwh (hot desert) or bwk (Temperate Desert).

Other regions of the world have cold deserts, including areas of the Himalayas and other high - altitude areas in other parts of the world.
Others occur on the eastern side of the rocky mountains, the eastern side of the Southern Andes and in Southern Australia.
Others store water in succulent leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers.
Other xerophytic plants have developed similar strategies by a process known as convergent evolution.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi - arid lands for millennia.
Plants face severe challenges in arid environments.
Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water - resistant cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory.
Polar Deserts (also seen as "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain.
Polar deserts cover much of the ice - free areas of the arctic and Antarctic.
Polar deserts such as mcmurdo dry valleys remain ice - free because of the dry katabatic winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains.
Potential Evapotranspiration, then, is the amount of water that could evaporate in any given region.
Problems They need to solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce.
Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.
Rounded Mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.
Sandstorms occur with much less frequency than dust storms.
Some major oilfields such as ghawar are found under the sands of Saudi Arabia.

The cultivation of semi - arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification.
The distance between their crests corresponds to the average length of jumps made by particles during saltation.

The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the martian polar regions.
The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, Ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards.
They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea.
They are often preceded by severe dust storms and occur when the wind velocity increases to a point where it can lift heavier particles.
They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low - lying areas.
They form downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle.
They have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day.
They limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata, by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves.
They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth.
This area of deposited clay, silt or sand is known as a playa.
This is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.
When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind.
When They descend on the leeward side, they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation occurs.
When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side.
Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.
With few inputs, they were at the mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level.

Additionally, some dives can be started in a flying position.
Adult Divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving.
A greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers.
All of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult / complex a dive is.
Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.
Amount of splash - many judges award divers for the amount of splash created by the diver on entry, with less splash resulting in a higher score.
An alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation.
A number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills.
Attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries.
At the moment of take - off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution.
Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty.
Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.

About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi - arid.
A semi - arid desert or a steppe is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity.
As the desert mountains decay, large areas of shattered rock and rubble occur.
Berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells.
Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.
Cold deserts, sometimes known as temperate deserts, occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts, and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air.
Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for Agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation.
Deserts, both hot and cold, play a part in moderating the earth's temperature.
Deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges.
Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night.
Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields.
Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder Granites, limestone and sandstone.
Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes.
European interest in the sahara desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land.
Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants.
Former Desert Areas Presently in non - arid environments, such as the sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts.
For these reasons, the front line moved back and forth through hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained momentum.
Humans have long made use of deserts as places to live, and more recently have started to exploit them for minerals and energy capture.
In Common with cacti, many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals.
In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain.
In some parts of the world, deserts are created by a rain shadow effect.
In the first part of the night, as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day, they emerge and search for prey.
In the köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as bwh (hot desert) or bwk (Temperate Desert).

Is Complex and dynamic, varying by culture, era, and technologies; thus the use of the word desert can cause confusion.
It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot.
Lakes may form in basins where there is sufficient precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above.
Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors.

Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water - resistant cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory.
Polar deserts such as mcmurdo dry valleys remain ice - free because of the dry katabatic winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains.
Potential Evapotranspiration, then, is the amount of water that could evaporate in any given region.
Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.
Sandstorms occur with much less frequency than dust storms.

The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the martian polar regions.
The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, Ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards.
They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low - lying areas.
They form downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle.
They have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day.
They limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata, by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves.
They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
This area of deposited clay, silt or sand is known as a playa.
This is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.
When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind.
When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side.
Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.
AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the all - American team.
Additionally, some dives can be started in a flying position.
A greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers.
All of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult / complex a dive is.
Amount of splash - many judges award divers for the amount of splash created by the diver on entry, with less splash resulting in a higher score.
An alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation.
A number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills.
Attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries.
