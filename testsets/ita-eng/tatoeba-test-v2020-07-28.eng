He was the first to help her.
Are the children already asleep?
We must wait here.
I am Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleared the street of snow yesterday.
I'm not at all busy now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Hurry up, guys.
I like your painting.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like her hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm studying at the University of Hyogo.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life ran smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They talk very fast.

You come from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
Did you actually believe that?

You are the tallest one.
Isn't this fun, Tom?

That's a beautiful photo.
I'll leave her alone.

We've humiliated them.
He is already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom isn't honest.
Tom's father is a police officer.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I have no plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We enjoyed ourselves.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got irritated.
I am already old.
I've got a criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book at a bookstore.
Tomorrow I am going to the bookshop to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see it.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody leave.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I am being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where did everyone else go?
I'm relaxed.

Tom used to play soccer.
Stop babbling.
I know you.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put away your bicycle.
I meant that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I might go to the movies.
It's not a date.
You make me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give Mary that?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
Do you want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is devious, isn't he?
Is this cage meant to protect against sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the writer of this novel?
I wish you'd call me.
Don't you want a job?

Can you write Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
She ate one apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
She broke herself of the habit of smoking.
I have no alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
She is smarter than he is.
What are you going to be doing this summer?
He became irritated.
Can you speak Shanghainese?
It shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.

Something bad happened to them.
How much did you get paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
She's still there with you, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them that's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a meeting.
There is no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
She's a little overweight, isn't she?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I'd decided not to do that again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
She slept in the car.
Tom and I'll go to Boston with Mary.
He consumed all his income on drinking.
Google harder!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk as if you were the boss.
Do you want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does that sounds familiar?
I will check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Are they going to die?
I really enjoy it a lot.
Are you coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
You're unbelievably stupid.
We were landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
She convinced the teacher.
When will his new novel come out?
I'd never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You are good.
How would you change it?
It's snowing today.
She made a promise to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our child by myself.
Go fetch some milk.
Tom looked startled.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I've forgotten whether you drink wine or not.
Who notified them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 thousand for this statue." "Who will give more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss you?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I wasn't raised like that.
You may park here.
Please tell him to hurry up.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics a lot.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer evening.
I always walk.
You're decisive.
You're really not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for his car key.
I really don't feel like talking.
Then you must be Argentinian.
I really love my work.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
You're shaken.
You should've done that yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cooking.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you need not go right now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It will clear up in the afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a fluke.
What do you imagine when you see that picture?
How many continents are there in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom is angry with Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.

We are losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first one is English, the second one Italian.
Tom is getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow is a holiday.

I'm still busy.
I appreciate your insights.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly-fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should've changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I've asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom is still asleep.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't make much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
That's not my idea of fun, but whatever floats your boat.
Could you ask Tom to stop by after work?
He plays the drum.
She must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use most?
You lit the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before we came to Tokyo.
Nobody can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's opinion.
She plowed the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When is school over?
Tom and I are kind of busy.
She hired me.
I said I'd get it.
I knew that I was being watched.
I have plans with them tonight.
I may know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bicycle?
These shoes are too small for me to put on.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We've just got to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me that he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you are.
Look, I'll show you.
I affirmed that he was innocent.
The fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your tongue.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
Do you want to take this one?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold's heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You may choose what you want.
I'm at the hospital. I got struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
She turned off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
That was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe it? We're in Europe!
I waited for a bus to come.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.

It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.

Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my child.

The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
He's under the bed, isn't he?
I chopped down the branch with an ax.

On the table there are some books.
Come at least at six.

This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.

We listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The buzzer sounded.
Take it to the men in Room 318.
I'm falling in love with you.
We have to postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We got separated.
It's really early.
You've saved Tom's life twice.
I dislike big cities.
This happened to me.
She has not a few friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.

The people here are particular about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it'll soon go out of business if the food doesn't taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He is a man of his word.

Do you like my T-shirt?
I don't care if you go or not.

I admit it.

I'm from Greece.
He's a homophobe.
I appreciate your work.
I'm only eighteen.

What options do I have left?
He kept screaming.
I'm sure of his success.

I'll go and see them.
His story cannot be true.
I'll never get used to this.
I felt sorry for you.
The end doesn't justify the means.

You are too ready to speak ill of others.
I was relaxed.
You're very brave.
You have Halloween and Thanksgiving Day.
This is the first time I've ever mopped my room.

Why don't you do that, too?
We're here to meet her.
I bought it at a thrift shop.
We can't leave her here.
Give him another chance.

He was cowed by her intelligence.
Do what you can for them.
Have you ever been happy?
Talk to my boss.
Why did you want to leave early?

I believe this is the best choice.
We can't forget them.
Don't do anything halfway.
Happy birthday, dear friend!
I enjoy doing that.
I can't stand humidity.
Why did you tell this joke?
There's something wrong here.

Once isn't enough.
Sometimes I see him at the club.

I'm going to kill you.
Have you ever been to France?
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
Did something happen to him?
I'm still afraid of Tom.
Do you like these songs?
He has lied to me again and again.
You like sports, don't you?
How beautiful!
You underestimated them.
I think you're the only one who cares.
He's obnoxious, isn't he?
That's debatable.
He does twenty push-ups every morning.
Tom thinks that I'm in love with him.
I lost my dinner.
She said everything will be over between us.
I hope I'm not next.
Do you need instructions?

She is quick at everything.
I'm the same.

Would you buy that?
I should probably lose a little weight.
The patient is in a state of profound stupor.
What did Tom give you for Christmas?

Don't come into my room.
Do you hate him that much?
You're a very lucky man.
I really liked that film!
I have the feeling that I've met that guy before.
