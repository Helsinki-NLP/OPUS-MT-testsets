So what?
Are you two ready?
Tom congratulated Mary.
What do you think I'm going to do?
Thank you for coming.
In time, you will understand.
My brother is a good skater.
I am in Rome now.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Are you on Facebook?
Do you want to eat?
It's none of your business.
I told Tom to do it.
Do you want to sleep?
Good night!
What are you doing?
I borrowed it.
You have many books.
The password is "Muiriel".
Tom was surprised to see John and Mary out on a date.
The towel is in the bathroom.
What is in the garden?
I know you want to help Tom.
Don't let your feelings show.
Tom is always in a bad mood.
Tom can't come in.
Let's dance.
You are very brave.
Do you want to go?
She smiled.
It's hard to say what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I'm proud of you.
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.
Tom is very chatty.
There are islands in the sea.
I was upstairs.
This is my sister, Mary.
You may write in any language you want. On Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
I think, therefore I am.
Does Tom want to go home?
You are tired, aren't you?
How old are you?
Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?
I come inside to drink coffee.
I am running in order to catch the train.
We can try.
A fly fell in the soup!
Let's hope you're right.
I have children.
Your idea sounds like a good one.
Tom is a very nice boy.
It seems that Tom only eats fruits and vegetables.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I don't understand.
Can I help you?
We learned English.
You are my friend.
I smiled.
People were lined up to buy tickets.
I nearly forgot it.
I have two cats.
You are beautiful.
She was swimming.
Nice to meet you.
Tomorrow is another day.
Don't feel bad.
I have a pen.
Tom wasn't consulted.
Tom drinks.
I don't want to go to school.
Tom enlisted in the army.
Water, please.
I should go to the party.
I want to say goodbye.
I'm sorry for what I did.
Hurry up!
Tom must be Mary's boyfriend.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
Tom is busy now, so he can't talk with you.
It's just a guess.
Where does it hurt?
I am eating a banana.
I was quite annoyed.
I will be back soon.
They lied to us.
Where do you come from?
I don't know the rules.
I saw the girl.
Thank you for coming.
I just don't know what to say.
I have to leave now.
I am eating rice.
Where do you come from?
Tom and Mary went fishing together.
Welcome.
Hello, what's your name?
I'm so fat.
I have a car.
I want to cry.
We had to make the best of a bad deal.
Don't bother me.
I told Tom to do it.
It wasn't that expensive.
Do you speak Japanese?
I think I can probably speak French better than Tom.
Let's play.
Tomorrow is another day.
Do you have a cellphone?
You don't have to explain.
Where are you going?
It was so beautiful.
Please forgive me for being late.
I want to dance.
I don't understand what you want.
Can I take a picture of you?
I want to go.
I don't want to think about what could've happened.
Can you please repeat what you just said?
Tom thought that you were in Boston.
I designed it myself.
Cheers!
Look at this!
What did you say?
Let's work.
Tom bought the whole nine yards.
What are you doing?
This is my sister, Mary.
Please forgive me.
I am at home.
You must control yourself.
Is that your first name or your last name?
This is the book that Tom was talking about yesterday.
I want to eat.
It's cold.
You've never seen one of these before, have you?
Good morning!
It is sunny today.
Tom has been busy at work.
Tom hid himself behind the curtain.
An investigation is ongoing.
Do you feel OK today?
Why didn't you just call?
I think you should see this.
It will rain tonight.
Tom is tempted.
Am I allowed to be in here?
You look very dignified.
They lied to us.
Who's the party for?
This might be over soon.
I can't meet you now.
I understand.
We got robbed last night.
Just tell me what it is.
Have a drink.
Let's eat.
What's in the closet?
She has absolutely no enemies.
My house is far away.
Tom looks amazing.
Happy New Year!
Tom thought you were in Boston.
She smiled sadly.
How do you say XXX in English?
Calm down.
I want to say goodbye.
We walked to the river.
What are you doing in my room?
I don't have any clean clothes to wear.
I didn't give Tom anything.
Goodbye!
Can you tell us your name?
Good evening.
You must control yourself.
I love you.
They were dying.
I also had a very good time.
How do you say XXX in English?
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom is now living in Boston.
I like learning languages.
My dream came true.
You look very tired.
What is the time?
I am married.
Open your eyes.
It wasn't really a plan.
Say it again.
I'm going to go.
Do you drink coffee?
Let's ask.
I have to go to sleep.
What time is it?
This is a book.
She asked the police for protection.
What did you order?
Stand up!
I don't understand what you want.
Let's eat.
I am married.
I have a headache.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when writing in French.
Many people are still missing.
How have you been?
I have food.
I can't get rid of my cold.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
How about you?
What does he do?
Tom sent me here to protect you.
Tom peeled the carrots.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
Show it to me.
I eat fish every week.
Tom is extremely outgoing, isn't he?
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
Tom is extremely outgoing, isn't he?
You're a tease.
I like tea.
I don't want to go to school.
Tom looks amazing.
I have been busy.
I'm tired.
That's no way to talk about Tom.
I am not a doctor.
Tom is tempted.
Why didn't you just call?
Tom betrayed Mary.
He's not breathing!
We appreciate the warning.
I know.
It is raining.
It's late. You have to go home.
Tom broke something again.
Tom sent me here to protect you.
Have something to drink.
Come dance!
Go away.
You're on the right track.
Who is your teacher?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
We can try.
No way!
We're eating popcorn.
You must control yourself.
Tom tried to keep calm.
Tom has written a few textbooks.
We went to the park to play baseball.
Tom danced.
Tom is a lousy dancer.
Tom always seem to be in trouble.
What happened?
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
Tom likes fruit.
Do you want to go to the hospital?
I am eating dinner with my husband.
He was alone in the room.
Are you married?
Do you still have a gun?
Several students in the back of the classroom laughed quietly.
What's the time?
What are you thinking about?
Do you drink coffee?
Tom has completely recovered and can go back to work.
I love you.
Drink something.
What's your favorite thing to do?
I wasn't aware Tom had done that.
Let's play.
Who's the party for?
How long have you been here for?
We can use force if we have to.
I am eating rice.
I prefer to work on my own.
I don't want to think about what could've happened.
Tom is a reasonable person.
Sorry for being late.
Are you enjoying the holidays?
Tom and Mary went fishing together.
That stuff is poisonous.
Do you speak Japanese?
I am not married yet.
Thank you for the present.
She's got a point.
What kind of gift do you want?
I have to get some money out of the bank.
Are you at home?
Why are you afraid?
I want to learn.
She never saw her brother again.
She doesn't want to be with anyone.
Muiriel is 20 now.
I know it for sure.
Don't you recognize it?
I run every day.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
It's still for sale.
What?
I really do think that.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
I am not married yet.
Come with me.
I know you have it.
Sorry, what's your name?
What are you cooking?
Do you remember me?
Thank you for coming.
Well done!
I hired a guide.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Tom found that.
I assume you're the Tom everybody's been telling me about.
Let's not talk about this today.
Close the door, please.
Have you got a car?
It may rain.
This word comes from Greek.
Tom has no money in his pocket.
Tom is our friend.
We need to be more aggressive.
Tom hasn't seen Mary in three years.
Do you want to go?
I put some milk in my coffee.
Call the police!
Tom enlisted in the Army.
Well, it's complicated.
Are you sure?
You are very brave.
Tom's a very bad guy.
Look over there.
Let's celebrate!
Congratulations!
Stay quiet and be alert.
What are you doing in my room?
Who are you?
What would you like to eat?
How old are you?
This is my sister, Mary.
Let's walk.
I wanted to steal it.
It's not a virus.
Hurry up.
It was sunny yesterday.
Many people are still missing.
Yes.
It's late. You have to go home.
He was born in the 19th century.
Let's dance.
They obeyed.
Let's go!
I know you're probably wondering why I'm here.
You're both awfully quiet.
Where is your school?
Can you help me?
I'm here to help you.
You're obviously sick.
I like fish.
Thank you.
Tom hasn't seen Mary in three years.
I like to run.
I have two cousins.
Tom is really lucky.
Tom is seldom late for appointments.
I want to know.
I'm the one with the money.
What are you talking about?
I've been working on this for three weeks.
Happy New Year!
Tom is proud of his son.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom and I have that in common.
I am eating lunch with my sister.
I am eating fruit.
What's your name?
I am a vegetarian.
I also feel the same way.
We needed a break.
She often sits there reading a book.
I like apples best.
I'm sorry for making you cry.
Good day!
I agree with you that we should try again.
Where is the tree?
Do you have a car?
I like seeing you this way.
The queen stood beside the king.
Don't go near this dog.
Please forgive me for being late.
Have something to drink.
Are you winning?
Come with me.
Are you tired?
Can't we talk about this later?
I like dogs.
Why are you crying?
I don't agree with you.
Thank you for today.
Where is Tom?
I want to run.
I have two cousins.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
No.
Are you a student?
Come here.
Who is your teacher?
Tom asked John what Mary's last name was.
It took time.
Tom can sing very well.
What is your name?
What are you eating?
How many eggs could you get yesterday?
Let's ask.
My name is Jack.
The boy didn't have an appetite.
They were dying.
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
Please let me know your new address.
How long did you stay?
The book is on the table.
Tom invited me over for dinner.
Do you have a contingency plan?
Tom found that.
I don't like horror movies.
We're persistent.
Are you in London?
Do you want to rest?
I am married.
Are you ready?
I couldn't keep lying to Tom.
I met him several times.
You've never seen one of these before, have you?
I can't meet you now.
She asked him to marry her.
Does she have a passport?
That was naive of me.
Go away.
I have a stomachache.
This is my computer.
Who told you about this cave?
Tomorrow is her birthday.
Do you want to do it together?
Excuse me.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.
Tom is already sound asleep.
Where do you live?
It was so beautiful.
I don't know.
I think Tom dyes his hair.
Do you understand me?
It's not that bad yet.
You're welcome.
Tom is very chatty.
I need you.
Tom should be there.
Tom is really lucky.
They lied to us.
Tom couldn't decode the secret message.
Are you sure?
We do very demanding work.
Are you sure you don't need my help?
He doesn't look his age.
Tom hasn't seen Mary in three years.
Tom is our friend.
Why would anyone care?
You've made Tom unhappy.
There are islands in the sea.
What's your full name?
Many people are still missing.
I also feel the same way.
Do you want to help?
What time is it now?
Tom fell into the water.
You've made Tom unhappy.
Tom told Mary that her boyfriend was looking for her.
I have money.
They were dying.
Show me how.
Is it yours?
She doesn't want to be with anyone.
Don't be afraid.
Why are you afraid?
Are you loyal?
Come on Monday afternoon, if possible.
Let's eat.
I forgot my email address.
They say it will rain.
Are you married?
I also had a very good time.
Welcome.
I checked my watch and realized I was an hour early.
I am in London.
This might be over soon.
Do you want to eat?
When are you leaving for Rome?
Come with me.
You should sleep.
What's your lucky number?
Come here.
I understand.
Do good to those who hate you.
Look here.
Did everything go well?
I like languages!
If you want to come over, call first.
Did I give you that impression?
I agree with you.
What happened?
Look!
I think what Tom is doing is great.
I didn't know Tom lived here.
Happy birthday!
What can they do?
Why are you dancing?
Why don't you call me Tom?
Drink something.
Let's go!
Tom isn't very talented, is he?
It's none of your business.
There are islands in the sea.
Why are you laughing?
Have you seen this man?
I run quickly.
We needed a break.
Mom will buy us a puppy.
I drink.
Do you want to do it together?
This is the safest place I know.
I am not married.
Please sit down.
Next February, I'll be going to Australia for one year to study.
What is it you want from me?
I am not a doctor.
Tom ought to do something for Mary.
What's your full name?
Come with me.
Am I allowed to be in here?
I borrowed it.
Tom patted me on the shoulder.
It wasn't that expensive.
Do you live here?
Tom and Mary took a long walk through the countryside.
We're persistent.
Don't worry.
Could you send me a picture?
I am not married yet.
I am in Tokyo today.
Close the door, please!
I suggest you don't ask Tom that question.
What's your favorite thing to do?
Please forgive me.
It's a compliment.
It's none of your business.
Do you want to know?
He walked to the house.
What's your first name?
The boy who came yesterday was my younger brother.
Hello!
Do you really want to be a soldier?
I don't see the relevance.
Is it yours?
Please come here.
Shut up!
You danced.
How are you?
Thank you for listening.
Tom has completely recovered and can go back to work.
He doesn't look his age.
I cried reading this book.
Tom told me that I was thirty minutes late.
She doesn't want to be with anyone.
Everything's quite satisfactory.
Thank you for your help.
Merry Christmas!
Tom died with a gun in his hand.
It's a compliment.
You didn't do anything.
Tom and I have that in common.
Tom was surprised to see John and Mary out on a date.
You're Tom's students, right?
I love to skate.
They swam.
I am taking a rest in my car.
Nobody seemed surprised.
I thought it might be useful.
I like running.
Why don't you give me a ride?
I didn't go out because it was very cold.
Tom's voice is unmistakable.
How long did you stay?
I don't have any money.
I miss you.
Does Tom want to go home?
Does Tom know French?
I'm thirsty.
It was so beautiful.
Come and dance with me!
They smiled.
Are you all right?
Goodbye!
How are you?
I'm eating dinner with my husband.
Don't be afraid.
It was raining.
Tom couldn't decode the secret message.
Lift it up.
I like dogs.
Don't worry.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Why?
You won't be the only one there.
Tom is extremely outgoing, isn't he?
Do you love me?
Tom was lucky that he didn't get killed.
Do you need more time?
Tom and I are going out for a walk.
They were swimming.
We met for lunch at Chuck's Bar and Grill.
Let's celebrate!
Tom didn't know what to do next.
No.
Why don't you give me a ride?
It's late. You have to go home.
I've been saying the same thing.
Let's walk.
You didn't do anything.
Tom doesn't tell stories very well.
Are you enjoying the holidays?
Are you hungry?
Tom doesn't seem to be having fun.
I've got everything I need.
It's about to rain.
Why didn't you just call?
We got robbed last night.
Do you want to play?
I want to go.
It was a funny moment.
Let's go out before it gets hot.
Come with me.
I am not married.
I think it's really cool.
They were dying.
You're obviously sick.
You don't have to explain.
You can believe me.
Did Tom say why he gave it to you?
Can I take a picture here?
Look over there.
I have two cousins.
This might be over soon.
I'm sorry.
What can they do?
Are you married?
Many people are still missing.
Why are you sad?
Do you speak English?
This is my sister, Mary.
Let's eat.
What's this?
If you want to come over, call first.
Betty killed him.
We're still investigating.
Is that what you told Tom?
OK, I get the idea.
Thank you for coming.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?
Tom looked annoyed.
Tell me again.
I am not married.
I should go to the party.
I gave Tom some money.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
We do very demanding work.
I think you're right.
We haven't finished doing that.
I also had a very good time.
She smiled happily.
All Tom wanted was for Mary to love him as much as he loved her.
She is helping him.
Tell me!
What's Tom doing today?
Can you tell us your name?
I know you want to help Tom.
How old are you?
Please come here.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Is competition good for kids?
You're obviously sick.
I'm busy with my homework.
Maybe Tom's got something to hide.
What do you want?
China is bigger than Japan.
You can do it.
What's your first name?
Tom often wears black.
Wait for us.
Tom asked me who had painted the picture.
Are you on Facebook?
Where is your father?
See you later!
I'm hungry!
Does Tom have a crush on Mary?
Tom was late for the bus.
What's your full name?
Do you feel safe here?
This is never going to end.
Do you still have a gun?
I like languages.
We can try.
Would you please open the door for me?
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Come with me.
Tom's wife's pregnant.
Many people are still missing.
Why did you call me?
Go away.
Thank you.
I didn't strangle Tom.
My grandfather no longer drives.
Please sit down!
I knew you'd been studying French.
How did you like Boston?
I don't think Tom can do that.
Tell me.
Show me again.
You should sleep.
Those who want to stay can stay.
Come on Monday afternoon, if possible.
Tom lives in a small town where nobody locks their doors.
They obeyed.
I also feel the same way.
Excuse me.
Goodbye!
Are you Japanese?
I prefer to work on my own.
Smile.
Where do you come from?
Don't worry. Everything is going well.
I've been very busy lately.
We learned English.
My brother is a good skater.
Do you speak Italian?
Where are you?
He seems to be rich now.
Why are you angry?
Tom couldn't make an immediate decision.
I know you are struggling.
Do you want to go to the hospital?
We are learning Spanish.
If you want something done right, sometimes you've just gotta do it yourself.
Let's work.
Tom folded his clothes and put them in his suitcase.
That is essential.
Good night!
Does Tom want to go home?
Come eat!
This sounds interesting.
I warn you not to do that again.
I have a cat.
It was no coincidence.
Are you happy?
What's he doing over there?
Don't harm them.
Why would I want this?
I'm a student.
Tom still has a few options.
Thank you for the suggestion.
In time, you will understand.
Thank you for everything.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
It's late. You have to go home.
I can't live without you.
What is your name?
Would you please open the door for me?
I wish I knew what happened to Tom.
Didn't you hear the doorbell?
I'm the one with the money.
You needed me.
He was born in the 19th century.
I don't understand.
What kind of gift do you want?
Are you married?
This is my sister, Mary.
Tom looked a bit sick.
Tom made it quite clear what he didn't want us to do.
The wound has not healed yet.
She asked the police for protection.
How many Christmas cards did you get last year?
Where are you from?
I've been busy.
I believe you.
As you say.
I must repay my debts.
I think about her often.
"I've been busy." "Busy doing what?"
Do you speak English?
Don't you recognize it?
In time, you will understand.
I can't share it with anyone.
God bless you!
What do you want?
Tom loved us.
I like to walk in the rain.
What are you looking for?
How much does this cost?
This is my sister, Mary.
