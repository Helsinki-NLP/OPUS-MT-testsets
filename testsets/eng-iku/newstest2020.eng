>>House commenced at 13:33
Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook): Mr. Quassa, can you say the opening prayer, please.
Speaker: Good afternoon, Premier and members. Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast and watching the televised proceedings, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.
We will proceed directly to the orders of the day.
Premier of Nunavut, Premier Quassa.
Minister’s Statement 046 – 5(1): Nunavut’s 2018 Indspire Recipient (Quassa)
Hon. Paul Quassa: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good day, my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity today to recognize and congratulate along with my colleagues Dr. Donna May Kimmaliardjuk, recipient of the 2018 Youth – Inuit Indspire Award in Winnipeg.
Donna is the very first Inuk doctor.
Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and is the first ever Inuk heart surgeon.
She is currently in her fourth year of a six-year residency program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.
Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was accepted in 2014 as one of only 10 cardiac surgery residents across all of Canada.
In 2016 she joined the National Aboriginal Council on HIV/AIDS as the Inuit representative.
There, she provides the council with a crucial perspective combining her medical expertise with Inuit culture.
Mr. Speaker, the Indspire Awards represent the highest honour the indigenous community presents to its people.
The Inspire Awards celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2018 and have so far honoured 350 First Nations, Inuit and Métis individuals who demonstrate outstanding achievement.
The awards show is a celebration of culture that highlights the diversity of indigenous peoples in Canada.
This year the Indspire Awards take place on March 23 in Winnipeg.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my fellow members to please join me in offering our congratulations to Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, as she prepares to accept this honour.
Through her hard work and dedication, she is bridging the gap for Inuit accessing medical services, and she’s leading the way for the next generation of Nunavut youth.
I know I speak for us all when I say how proud we are of Dr. Kimmaliardjuk’s accomplishments and how much we look forward to seeing where this incredible journey takes her.
Minister of Justice, Minister Ehaloak.
Minister’s Statement 047 – 5(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing Program (Ehaloak)
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to talk about a new cultural program for male inmates at the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility.
Inmates participating in the program learn how to work with sealskin, leather, and other materials and have made winter coats, sealskin mitts, sealskin pants, sealskin hats, bullet bags, and thermos [bags].
The program is currently run by Rosemary Angugasak Sandy, a well-respected elder and a highly renowned seamstress all over the world.
She recently travelled to Norway to teach individuals how to work with and prepare sealskins.
She was an instructor at the Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production Program and also helped to facilitate the Miqqut Project with the Nunavut Literacy Council.
With Rosemary’s help and guidance, inmates learn culturally relevant skills in a healthy, safe environment rooted in Inuit language, traditional practices, and healing.
The sewing program will work with and support the facility’s land program where inmates learn to hunt wildlife and how to properly prepare the skins and the meat.
These harvested skins will then be used as part of the sewing program.
Programs like these can help inmates reintegrate back into their community after they have completed their sentence, encouraging them to continue these traditional activities rather than engage in criminal behaviour.
I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and was encouraged to see the positive impact of these cultural programs, particularly those supported by dedicated community elders like Rosemary Sandy.
Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.
Minister’s Statement 048 – 5(1): Red Seal-endorsed Certification in Truck and Transport Mechanic (Savikataaq)
Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say “good day” to the people of Arviat. Daughter, please don’t be late to school.
Mr. Speaker, I’ll say my statement on the Red Seal-endorsed certification in truck and transport mechanic.
In September 2016 the heavy equipment technician trade, with all three sub-trades, became a designated trade in Nunavut.
This enabled Nunavut to offer apprenticeships in these trades and sub-trades, as well as issue certificates of qualification, more generally known as a journeyperson’s ticket.
In November of 2017 Nunavut received authorization to offer Red Seal-endorsed certification in truck and transport mechanic, one of the sub-trades of heavy equipment technician.
A journeyman who passes an interprovincial Red Seal examination has demonstrated exceptional knowledge in their trade and can work anywhere in Canada.
Mr. Speaker, I am happy that we have been able to create the opportunity for Nunavummiut to earn cross-country recognition of having achieved excellence in this new Red Seal trade in Nunavut.
Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.
Minister’s Statement 049 – 5(1): New Funding for Early Learning and Child Care Facilities (Joanasie)
Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, people of Cape Dorset, Kimmirut, and Nunavut.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I announce today that the Department of Education is providing a top-up O&M program contribution funding to eligible licensed child care facilities.
Mr. Speaker, this increase is a result of the three-year action plan that my staff developed for the Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement which was signed in September 2017 with the Government of Canada.
Mr. Speaker, this current fiscal year will see all eligible licensed child care facilities receive an increase of a minimum of $1,918.80 to a maximum of $45,494.80 depending on the number, type, and location of the spaces and facility.
As long as facilities do not raise their parental fees, they will also be eligible for similar funding for the next fiscal year.
Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only assist licensed child care facilities with their operating costs; it will also assist families by keeping the parental fees from increasing.
Mr. Speaker, we are pleased that we are able to provide this funding to help out the child care facilities and the families.
We believe that this funding will have a positive impact by stabilizing both the funding and parental fees.
Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.
Minister’s Statement 050 – 5(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Sheutiapik)
Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.
Mr. Speaker, the mining industry represents a key pillar of Nunavut’s economic development.
Our department is committed to supporting the mining industry and ensuring that Nunavummiut are able to benefit from this activity.
Mr. Speaker, soon people from across Canada will be in Iqaluit for the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium from April 9 to 12, 2018.
This symposium is a terrific opportunity for people to find out the latest in Nunavut’s mineral exploration and mining industry and to ensure that our communities are aware and involved in mining and exploration in our territory.
We anticipate that this year’s mining symposium will continue to be one of the best attended conferences in Nunavut and we anticipate over 400 people to take part.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mining industry, Inuit organizations, prospectors, community members, and all other stakeholders to this important forum.
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all members of the public to come and take part during the public portion of the symposium on April 11.
This is not only an opportunity to get some excellent swag, but also about the impacts of mining and exploration and give stakeholders your feedback.
Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.
Member’s Statement 096 – 5(1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Grandson (Rumbolt)
Five years ago today the Speaker of this House at the time rose in the House to congratulate me on becoming a grandfather. Today I get the privilege of wishing my grandson a happy fifth birthday.
Happy birthday, Jayden.
Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.
Member’s Statement 097 – 5(1): Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment (Qirngnuq)
Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The statement I will be making today applies to our youth and their future. It can assist with plans they may wish to undertake for a future career.
I rise today to share some good news with my colleagues.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that Inuit youth from across the Kitikmeot region will gather in Cambridge Bay next week for the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment event.
Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for Kitikmeot youth to come together to discuss a number of priority areas of concern for youth.
These include:
Mental health;
Youth centres;
Substance abuse;
The importance of learning about Inuit history, residential schools, and reconciliation; and
The preservation, protection, and promotion of Inuit language and culture.
Mr. Speaker, this year’s participants from Taloyoak are:
Jody Karoo;
David Tongelik;
Howard Panigayak;
Laverne Oleekatalik; and
Crystal Mitchell.
The participants from Kugaaruk are:
Becky Makittuq;
Loranda Rose Audviq Qirngnuq;
Christine Juliana Qirngnuq;
Shantel Kanayuk Qirngnuq; and
Pauline Illuitok.
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in wishing the participants a very successful gathering.
Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.
Member’s Statement 098 – 5(1): Cannabis Legislation (Lightstone)
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I rise to convey concerns that I have received from a number of my constituents concerning the government’s pending legislation of cannabis.
I would like to read from a letter I just recently received. It states, “My family and I currently live in a public housing unit in an attached apartment row housing unit in Iqaluit.
For the last couple of years, we have had to deal with my neighbour smoking cigarettes and cannabis in their apartment. The problem is the smell comes right into our apartment, and it smells as if someone who had been smoking in our unit and it’s very strong.”
It goes on and it gives a bit more detail, but most importantly it states that “I’m concerned about the health impacts smoking in units can have on my children and everyone else’s, but my priority are my kids and other kids that are in the same situation.”
Mr. Speaker, like many residents of Iqaluit, my family and I live in a multi-unit dwelling.
Mr. Speaker, an issue that affects residents of such buildings is second-hand smoke.
Mr. Speaker, second-hand tobacco smoke has long been acknowledged to be a significant health risk, which is why governments across the country have acted in recent years to regulate and restrict the places in which tobacco can be smoked.
As the father of a young baby myself, I don’t want any children unnecessarily exposed to such health risks as second-hand tobacco smoke and/or second-hand cannabis smoke.
As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out in her questions last week to the Minister of Health, there are a number of health risks associated with the consumption of cannabis.
From talking with my constituents in recent months, I know that many of them have the same concerns.
Mr. Speaker, I recognize that issues like this are a balancing act.
The federal government’s legalization of recreational cannabis is, in all likelihood, going to be passed by Parliament within the next few months.
I would like to request unanimous consent to conclude my statement.
The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?
Mr. Lightstone, please proceed.
Thank you, members.
Under this legislation, adults will be permitted to possess and consume cannabis. However, it will be up to the government and legislature to establish the detailed rules concerning such issues as where cannabis can be smoked in our communities.
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet pointed out last week that the Government of Nunavut’s own public consultation materials clearly acknowledge the need to address the issue of rules concerning cannabis cultivation and consumption in rental units and public housing, as well as condominiums.
Mr. Speaker, it’s my belief that the legislation which is introduced in this House needs to clearly address this issue, and I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to strike the best possible balance.
Before we proceed, you probably realized that MLA Akoak is not here today. He is not feeling well and will be absent today.
Mr. Akoak, if you are listening, we hope you get well soon.
Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.
Member’s Statement 099 – 5(1): Increasing Education Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)
Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Hello to Baker Lake and all of Nunavut.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to do more to expand educational opportunities in the community of Baker Lake.
Mr. Speaker, the community of Baker Lake is growing fast. It will be important to step in and provide opportunities for residents to learn more skills and find more ways to contribute to the community and society.
Mr. Speaker, the Piqqusilirivvik facility operates a satellite program in Baker Lake.
This program could be greatly expanded to provide greater awareness and experience in Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.
Mr. Speaker, the concept of establishing a university in Nunavut has been suggested and Agnico Eagle Mines have expressed their willingness to support this initiative if it should move forward.
What better place to move it forward than in central Nunavut which is also the geographic centre of Canada.
Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues mentioned the other day how important it is for us to jump at opportunities and seize them before they pass by.
The wheels of government turn slowly, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t encourage, push, and promote opportunities that are there before us.
Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of our term as Nunavut’s Fifth Assembly and I for one would like to see us take great strides forward.
Expanding educational opportunities in communities such as Baker Lake would be a good step in the right direction.
Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.
Member’s Statement 100 – 5(1): Concerns with Larga Boarding Home (Kamingoak)
Ms. Kamingoak: Koana, Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon to my colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to have greater oversight of the day-to-day operations at our medical boarding homes.
Mr. Speaker, my constituents have brought a number of issues to my attention which I feel should have been addressed some time ago.
Problems with food services in particular have been noted repeatedly with meals being served on disposable plates and cutlery because the dishwasher has been broken for months.
Mr. Speaker, it is important that our government ensures that the services which are being paid for on behalf of Nunavut residents are actually being provided.
I do appreciate that the boarding homes are dealing with many clients on an ongoing basis. However, it is important that those clients are comfortable and well looked after.
Mr. Speaker, it is not clear whether the boarding home aspect of medical travel will be covered under the minister’s ongoing review of medical travel.
I look forward to seeing the results of the review and I hope to see recommendations which will result in an improvement in the level of services and conditions at our medical boarding homes.
Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.
Member’s Statement 101 – 5(1): Congratulations to Rosalie Ijjangiaq (Netser)
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate Rosalie Ijjangiaq of Naujaat.
Ms. Ijjangiaq is a high school student at Tuugaalik School in Naujaat. Earlier this year Ms. Ijjangiaq was awarded the Horatio Alger Canadian Scholarship.
Mr. Speaker, Horatio Alger scholarships are awarded to high school students who have overcome significant adversity while demonstrating strong academics and a commitment to pursuing post-secondary education.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ijjangiaq for her perseverance and commitment to furthering her education.
Our youth face many challenges and obstacles when working to achieve a post-secondary education.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Rosalie Ijjangiaq on her great accomplishment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.
Member’s Statement 102 – 5(1): Poasie Mike Recognized under Canada 150 (Nakashuk)
Ms. Nakashuk: Thank you.
Good afternoon, my colleagues, my relatives, and the people of Pangnirtung.
I rise this afternoon to express my pride to a constituent of mine who lives in Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.
He has been assisting the search and rescue for 18 years. Poasie Mike has been working with the local search and rescue group for 18 years. I rise to express my pride in him.
The last name on my list is the Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.
Member’s Statement 103 – 5(1): Budget Reflections (Main)
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I say “good day” to the people watching the televised proceedings, Inuit, Qallunaat, and everyone.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make some observations and recommendations concerning the government’s budget process.
Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are new to this place, the past two weeks has been both an experience and an education.
Mr. Speaker, as the Chairperson of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I want to say “ma’na, koana, qujannamiik” to all of my colleagues for the way we have been working together since the new Assembly started.
Mr. Speaker, I believe that we sent a strong message on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will not be taken for granted and that the government needs to respect both the letter and the spirit of its own procurement rules, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Main: Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk moved an important motion on Friday, and it is one that we will be following up on when the House reconvenes in a few weeks from now for the spring sitting.
Mr. Speaker, although our non-partisan, consensus style of government is not perfect, it does have a number of strengths.
For example, as I noted last week concerning the capital budget for Nunavut Arctic College, the government did listen to a number of our concerns regarding the college’s budget and made some actual changes to it.
I hope to see a lot more of that approach in the weeks and years ahead, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, members have been putting ministers to the test on a daily basis.
I think it’s fair to say that a major theme that has emerged is the need for more work in measuring and evaluating the actual outcomes and results of the government’s spending in a number of areas.
It is not enough to count the number of dollars that have gone out the door.
I would like to seek consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.
The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?
Mr. Main, please proceed.
Mr. Main: Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I was speaking about measuring outcomes and results.
Mr. Speaker, this information needs to be publicly tabled in the Legislative Assembly so that we, the elected representatives, can make informed, evidence-based decisions about whether or not any given item of spending should be increased, decreased, kept the same, or maybe even eliminated altogether in favour of doing other things with our limited dollars and resources.
Mr. Speaker, I’ll briefly point to some examples.
I think that it’s pretty safe to say that we can all agree that the cost to the government of administering its fuel tax rebate program for harvesters far outweighs the actual benefits that actual hunters are receiving.
That’s why the Department of Environment, which administers the government’s main suite of hunter support programs, has to take a good look at how those programs can be modified to accomplish the core goal of helping hunters with the cost of fuel.
Mr. Speaker, I’ll also again take the example of the government’s grants and contributions spending to illustrate and explain this point.
We know that the government has spent millions of dollars to promote economic development and diversification.
We know that a significant proportion of this funding has gone to for-profit, private businesses.
We know the amounts and we know who received the money.
What we don’t know is what any of this spending actually accomplished.
We don’t know how many jobs for Inuit and other Nunavummiut were created or sustained by this spending and we often don’t know what the money was actually spent on.
Mr. Speaker, as you know, I could go on for a long time in this vein, but I’m going to stop there.
I’ll just add as a final point that I’m looking forward to the main estimates in our upcoming budget session, and I’m very much looking forward to continuing our work with all of my colleagues to strengthen our budget process for the ultimate benefit of all of our communities and constituents.
Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.
Member’s Statement 104 – 5(1): Two More Elders Sent Out for Care (Towtongie)
Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
On behalf of the people of Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today in recalling that one of our oldest elder residents, Annie Tatty, is travelling to Ottawa by plane today.
As well, one of our oldest elders named Amaruq, as I rise to make my statement, is being sent off to Gjoa Haven due to the fact that there is no elders facility in Rankin Inlet.
I want to be heard as a representative for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet.
When I was elected in November and I saw the budget, I asked the Minister of Health where the plan is for an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut.
I was told by the Minister of Health that all Members of the Legislative Assembly care and are concerned for our elders.
We were advised that during the Pond Inlet meeting, the issue would be brought up in detail.
I am still waiting.
Last week I rose in the House during the capital estimates review when I didn’t see the funding allocated towards an elders facility, specifically for the construction of the facility.
I was informed that I was not supposed to speak about that matter and that I had to cease my questions.
Nonetheless, I was appreciative when our Chair, Mr. Rumbolt, permitted me to continue to voice what I felt was necessary regarding the elders facility and to fight for that.
Today I rise as an elected representative, feeling inadequate as I am not satisfied with our current reality.
The current practice of sending elders to southern facilities, to an alien landscape where the elders have no familiarity with is inappropriate.
In our campaigns we all made promises to try to be proper legislators and to have a functioning government, and we advised our elders that we want to extend our deep respect to them. Here we send our elders out of the territory of Nunavut.
Member for Amittuq, Mr. Kaernerk.
Member’s Statement 105 – 5(1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik’s Volunteer Search and Rescue (Kaernerk)
Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For a moment there, I thought I was forgotten.
I rise today to again express my pride in my fellow residents.
The Hall Beach search and rescue team is very dedicated, especially when searching for any individual thought to be in dire straits or when a search is called for.
They use their own equipment to conduct these searches.
I rise today to express my appreciation and to share my pride in the members of the Hall Beach SAR team. The chairperson is Kyle Issigaitok, the vice-chairperson is George Innuksuk, and the search coordinator is Martha Gibbons. When they are out on the land searching and a shelter is required, Daniel Qaunaq sets up a shelter for them.
The team’s elder, who I will continue to acknowledge when I can, is Abraham Oolalak.
He is the elder of the SAR team and, as I stated previously, he is always the first searcher setting out on a search when required, yet he is an elder in comparison to my youthfulness.
Again, I urge the youth to continue to assist our elders, as they have sage advice and wisdom.
Although we may not note the assistance of preparing for the future, they provide encouragement and I am able to be here today.
I regret my own impatience in my earlier days, as I should have taken their advice to heart.
In order for the youth to not experience my situation, when you are going hunting, please ensure you have the proper gear and equipment to face any situation.
Mr. Kaernerk: Another matter is the recognition of the Igloolik search and rescue team. Members of the Igloolik SAR team met with their Hall Beach counterparts in our town in preparation for the upcoming spring season. It is becoming milder and the weather is becoming nicer, so please ensure your gear and equipment is adequate for what you might be faced with.
With that being the case, I urge all hunters to take their SPOT devices or a GPS, as well as asking your elders for advice about the best travel routes for the destination you are planning to go to and which areas have the wildlife you are hunting.
Those are the types of questions you should ask.
To return to my reason for rising today, I want to reiterate the fact that the Hall Beach SAR team has one snowmobile and they have continued to request more equipment from the Department of CG&S, yet they have never received a response.
I encourage this government to provide more assistance to the essential SAR teams in our communities.
That’s all.
Last on my list is the Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.
Member’s Statement 106 – 5(1): Kinngait Performing Arts Club (Joanasie)
Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
They will be listening to memorable songs, singing the Mamaqtuq song, and this event will be held at the Sam Pudlat School in Cape Dorset. Anyone is welcome if they’re interested in music. They will be holding the music workshop.
I would like to acknowledge the Jerry Cans as they are very good songwriters, and also would like to thank the National Arts Centre along with the hamlet council of Cape Dorset.
There are none.
Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to acknowledge four people who are visiting.
The first one is Parks Canada Field Unit Superintendent for Nunavut Jenna Boon and the staff who always takes care of me and our children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.
I would like to thank each and every one of you. A person coming from the northernmost community is my sister, Naomi Kuukaa Kuluguqtuq. We’re grateful that she’s here.
In addition, she is a member of our staff who is following her child here for school and lives with us as a foster daughter. She’s always talking my daughter into going to school with her and I very much appreciate that. Let’s give a warm welcome to Jaiden Natanine.
I want to start with a short preamble here.
When I was still a young boy, as I used to be young once too…
…I caught my first silver jar seal pup when I was quite young and it was my very first seal which I shot in a lake.
I doubt many people have ever caught their first silver jar seal pup in a lake, and it was on the tiny island of Siuraq.
This couple provided much-needed assistance and they were taking on the role of parents for me, as they were like my mother and father.
I would like to say “thank you” to them for being able to come here.
Mr. Otak and your wife, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.
Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.
Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My parents lived in Wager Bay and my mother, although it is now within the park boundaries, gave every sibling copies of pictures from the place, so I acknowledge you. From the oldest sibling to the youngest person, we are very thankful.
As well, on occasion where I have travelled to Igloolik, I used to billet, as my Inuk name is Qaatani, with Theresa Otak, who presented me with a small tea pot, and Louie Otak, I am thankful that your food is quite delicious and I will billet with you again someday down the road.
Thank you so much.
Welcome to the gallery.
Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.
Ms. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to recognize Naomi Kuukaa Kuluguqtuq and Carol Akeeagok, who are family members.
Naomi came all the way from Grise Fiord. Mr. Speaker, it’s not every day I get family in the House.
Please feel welcome in your Legislative Assembly.
Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.
Ms. Nakashuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, wish to acknowledge and express my pride and to voice my gratitude to my husband, who is in the gallery, Andrew Nakashuk.
Please welcome him to the gallery.
Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Legislative Assembly.
Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.
Let’s proceed with the orders of the day.
We will begin with the Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.
Question 123 – 5(1): Private Security Legislation (Hickes)
Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My questions today are for the Minister of Justice.
A couple of my colleagues over the past week and a half have brought up the issue of security guards, training, and standardization.
My first question to the minister is if she is looking at bringing forward private security legislation during this term.
Minister of Justice, Minister Ehaloak.
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes, for the question.
As of today the Government of Nunavut does not have a Private Securities Act.
My department is aware of all the companies that are starting to provide security within our communities, such as the health centres.
We are currently researching and developing a policy to create a Nunavut Private Securities Act.
Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As the minister mentioned, we are one of the last jurisdictions in Canada to not have private security legislation. When we’re looking at the private security industry, we want to make sure that they’re competent and accountable. We want to make sure that they can deliver services professionally.
Almost every other jurisdiction in Canada has brought forward legislation on this topic.
My next question would be: if they are analyzing the policy on private security legislation, will there be a legislative proposal coming forward to this House?
Minister Ehaloak.
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work towards developing a policy or legislation for a Private Securities Act.
Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.
Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I thank the minister for that commitment.
Mr. Speaker, in the interim I just want to confirm, as Justice has oversight on law enforcement and in some respects security personnel are law enforcement officers, do they work with Community and Government Services in coordination of contract standards for any Government of Nunavut contract services for security?
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Any legislation or policies that are prepared within the Department of Justice or within any other department, when they’re writing policies, we make sure that my department is involved right from the beginning.
I don’t have that information with me right now, but I can look into it and get back to you.
Question 124 – 5(1): Status of Site Remediation in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)
Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.
I want to follow up on the questions that I asked the minister last week concerning the cleanup of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.
In one of her responses to me, the minister indicated that a “final report was prepared and given to the QEC.”
Would the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Municipal Council of Baker Lake and me as the community’s MLA?
Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Ehaloak.
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I can commit yes, Mr. Mikkungwak.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.
I thank the minister for her commitment.
In one of her responses to me, the minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation is “willing to work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to remediate the rest of the site.” Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to convey this good news to the municipality when I return to the community next week. I will encourage municipal officials to contact their Qulliq Energy Corporation counterparts to arrange a meeting.
Mr. Speaker, this shouldn’t be too difficult given that the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s headquarters is located in Baker Lake.
The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on this cleanup.
Can she clarify what the cost would be to remediate the rest of the site?
Minister Ehaloak.
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To remediate the whole site itself, it would cost approximately $10 million. The QEC does not have those kinds of funds, but like I said in my previous statement, the contaminated site was prior to the creation of Nunavut and the Government of Canada is responsible for those sites to be remediated.
Again, like I said, we are willing to work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to remediate the existing contaminated area.
Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.
As I noted in my questions last week, the question of whether the federal government or the territorial government should be responsible for these cleanup costs remains unresolved.
Mr. Speaker, I support the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s long-standing position that the contamination is attributable to events that took place when the site was under federal jurisdiction.
Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to explore and clarify the legal options that may be open to us in this regard?
Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, I can commit as Minister of the QEC and Minister of Justice that we will work together to resolve the issue.
Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.
Question 125 – 5(1): Educational Leave Policy (Lightstone)
My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.
Prior year’s Public Service Annual Report included information on how many employees were taking advantage of the government’s generous Education Leave Policy.
Unfortunately the 2016-17 Public Service Annual Report did not include that information.
Would the minister be willing to provide the Assembly with that information?
Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It seems the member would like the annual reports to include the information and the information should be contained in the next report. These annual reports are released annually.
With respect to the information that the member stated was missing, I will look into the report to see if it is available.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.
Once again I would just like to ask if the minister would be willing to provide the Assembly with the information on the number of employees that took advantage of the Education Leave Policy in the prior fiscal year, 2016-17.
Minister Akeeagok.
Speaker: Thank you. The question has been taken as notice.
Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.
Question 126 – 5(1): Status of Pangnirtung’s Old Health Centre (Nakashuk)
Ms. Nakashuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.
As the minister is aware, I have asked this question related to Pangnirtung’s previous health centre, probably now known locally as the old health centre, which is no longer used in any capacity upon the opening of the new health centre.
The old health centre has not been in use for quite some time. Nonetheless, all of the windows are boarded up.
My question to the minister is whether the department has any plans for this building and if he knows his department’s plans for this old health centre’s future.
Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.
Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I thank my colleague for asking that question.
When old surplus facilities that were owned by the government are not being used anymore by the department responsible, we ask other government departments whether they have any uses for it or not.
The old health centre was built in 1975 and Pangnirtung went through that process.
The Department of Health had no more use for it.
We looked into which department has any use for it and we haven’t heard back from any of them.
Using the government standard practice, we are now preparing whether the hamlet has any use for it. That’s where we are right now.
If they don’t want the facility, then we will go to the next step of whether a non-profit organization has any use for it.
This is the process we use for surplus government facilities.
That’s where we stand right now, Mr. Speaker.
Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.
If I understand correctly, now the community has been asked if they want to take it over. What’s going on?
Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We have not heard from government departments if they want to take it over or not.
Now we are waiting to see if the municipal government is interested in taking over the building.
That’s where we’re at right now.
Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.
Thank you, minister, for answering the question.
I don’t know whether the hamlet would be interested in taking over that building. If the hamlet does not want to take it over, what generally happens after that?
Thank you for asking questions about that.
There are more than four steps that we take.
Using the old health centre in Pangnirtung as an example, if the health department no longer requires it, we ask the other government departments if they are interested in taking it over.
They were not interested and so we’re now going to see if the hamlet is interested in it.
That’s the process that we normally follow.
Member for Netsilik…Aivilik, Mr. Netser.
Question 127 – 5(1): Family Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My name is Natsiq.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services today.
First of all, I would like to say to my constituents, I keep forgetting to say “good afternoon.” I have been here for a while now and I haven’t said “good afternoon,” so I say “good afternoon.”
We will be home soon and that’s great.
Mr. Speaker, it is an unfortunate reality that some of our more vulnerable Nunavut residents must travel south to receive care, in a strange environment, far away from their home and family.
I am sure you will agree that getting a visit from a family member makes all the difference in the world to these individuals.
The Family Services Client Travel Policy published on the government website is dated June 2013 and is effective to March 31, 2018.
I was given to understand that the former Minister of Family Services had committed to making changes to the Family Services Client Travel Policy.
Can the minister clarify whether there have been any revisions to his department’s Client Travel Policy since 2013 and, if not, will he be making any changes after March 31 of this year?
Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.
Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I can’t comment on any other commitments that may or may not have been said by the previous minister of the day, but I can say that this policy is in effect ‘til the end of March 2018 and, like normal policies, will stay in effect until the new one is in place.
I have not heard of any rumblings from within the department to do any changes to this policy.
If there needs to be a change, we can look at that, but we’re not going to change a policy just for the sake of changing because it has a sunset clause.
We would look at the policy and just see if there has to be any changes that would be beneficial to both the people that take advantage of this travel policy and for the Government of Nunavut.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, minister.
The Family Services Client Travel Policy’s Client Travel Benefits Guideline currently states that an adult client of Family Services who is in residential care is eligible to receive a visit from two family members or guardians per fiscal year.
Mr. Speaker, can the minister confirm whether or not this policy has been revised to permit two visits from two family members or guardians per fiscal year?
It will be two return trips, whether it can be two people going at the same time or one person going at two different times.
To make it very simple, two return trips per year per person who is in out-of-community care.
Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changing his department’s Client Travel Policy to increase the visit allocation for adult clients in residential care?
This policy is expiring soon and this policy would be looked at, but I can’t commit to anything right off the bat without looking at the policy.
The whole policy itself probably will be looked into because a lot of the travel that Family Services paid for are Health clients.
Therefore we have to work with Health and make sure that this policy is adhered to and that we’re running it prudently. I can’t commit to anything, but since this travel policy is expiring soon, I’m sure everything that is in this policy will be looked at.
Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.
Question 128 – 5(1): Contacting the Office of Patient Relations (Qirngnuq)
Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.
Mr. Speaker, from time to time, constituents come to my office in the community to ask for help in getting health issues resolved.
As the minister often tells us and earlier this week she even provided a phone number, Nunavummiut can contact the Office of Patient Relations with their concerns.
Mr. Speaker, language and even dialect is sometimes a barrier over the phone.
Can the minister tell this House what other ways the Office of Patient Relations can be contacted?
Minister of Health, Minister Angnakak.
Hon. Pat Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I understand your concern and yes, we usually like to try to encourage the toll-free number so you can get somebody right away.
I don’t have it right here right now, but there’s an email address as well and perhaps even a fax number.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.
Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m not sure if she answered the question or not, so I will ask this question.
Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns about privacy and confidentiality and I appreciate that we have to be very careful that personal health information does not get into the wrong hands.
The Office of Patient Relations has a form that can be filled out explaining a complaint or concern.
However, it is not possible for people to submit that form by fax. Not everyone has a computer. They can’t scan the form or send an email.
Can the minister explain why it is not possible to contact the Office of Patient Relations by fax?
An Hon. Member: Good question.
Minister Angnakak.
That’s a very good question, that’s true.
I think because it’s harder and harder to find fax machines, maybe going forward, we tend to use more electronic type of devices such as email or there are websites.
I’m just looking at my briefing note here. There’s a government website that can be reached and it is www.patientrelations.gov.nu.ca. I’m sure that we have health centres in every community.
If there’s a form that you wanted to fax in, I’m sure the health centres could be used for that. We also have GLO offices in every community.
I’m pretty sure that somebody in the community would have a fax that they could send it to our headquarters here.
If we don’t have a fax number at the Office of Patient Relations, it’s something I can find out and get back to the member on.
Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.
Question 129 – 5(1): Income Assistance Policies (Towtongie)
Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on questions asked by the Member for Kugluktuk regarding income assistance policies.
The minister has indicated that when income assistance clients go from workplace to workplace with a job search form, this is a “productive choice.”
Can the minister explain how doing a job search can be considered a “productive choice” when there are no jobs to be had?
Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.
On productive choices and looking for jobs, in my opinion I would say that if there are no jobs available at all, then it would be useless, but sometimes there are short-term jobs available like casual jobs.
Maybe if that person on the right day, on the same day when that casual job is available came in, then the person could get a job.
Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.
Income support is a policy of the Government of Nunavut.
If it was legislation, it would be impossible to make amendments to the policy.
I have seen young people who want you to sign, even though there are no job opportunities. They come every month about productive choices and sometimes they get embarrassed to ask for a job and the individual is feeling down.
Can the minister clearly describe what kinds of Nunavut-specific policies they have? Can you come up with a policy for that in the smaller communities?
We are following policies that are not geared for Nunavut.
The policy is just for Nunavut.
It can’t be used outside the territory.
In regard to income assistance, there was a study and the policy has been changed.
Anyone who is eligible for income support can request and they cannot claw back your child tax benefits. After the review, some changes have been made to the Income Support Program.
We were going to look at the job search form again.
It will be impossible to do a job search when there is no employment opportunity in the community. They have to choose a productive choice, so we will look at the productive choices. We are aware of that issue.
Question 130 – 5(1): Mine Training (Kaernerk)
Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to ask my questions to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.
I strongly support responsible mining activities that balance the need to create jobs and business opportunity with the need to protect our environment.
My questions today will focus on the issue of job training.
The current 2017-18 budget for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation includes a $200,000 Nunavut Mine Training Fund.
Can the minister indicate what projects her department has spent this funding on during the current 2017-18 fiscal year?
Mr. Speaker, I hope that makes sense.
Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.
Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I also thank the member for his question.
In regard to mining training, although not all of them have been reported… .
The department continues to work with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, Government of Canada, minerals industry, and Inuit organizations on a number of programs designed to prepare Nunavummiut for all opportunities in the mineral resource industries. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Kaernerk.
Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I thank the minister for her response.
Can the minister indicate if her department will be requesting an increase or decrease in this budget for the upcoming 2018-19 fiscal year?
Minister Sheutiapik.
I cannot respond to that question at this time, but perhaps I can get back to the member’s question for the $200,000 as to how the funding was utilized.
For the Kitikmeot Corporation drillers’ assistant training, $61,000 was used; for the Qikiqtani Inuit Association for financial literacy, $60,000; as well as for the Hamlet of Arviat for the work readiness program and class 3 airbrakes for $78,000. Thank you.
I also thank the minister for elaborating on my question.
Earlier in our sitting, I tabled a copy of my recent letter to the president of North Arrow Minerals concerning the Mel Diamond Project in North Baffin.
They will be drilling near Hall Beach this spring.
Further, with regard to the information I tabled about the proposed work to be undertaken near our community, I wonder if the minister can indicate how her department is working with not only North Arrow Minerals but all mining companies to identify job training opportunities for Inuit near my home community or for Inuit in Quttiktuq.
I believe these opportunities can provide beneficial employment for people due to this reasoning and to add further to this, Hall Beach is a smaller community and the project won’t be buying supplies from the community. However, some people have been hired to work on these projects, for which I thank them.
As you stated earlier, you will be working to support mining companies.
What I am trying to ask about is if these types of activities funded through the allocations the minister mentioned.
To use this example, the Mary River project is in the Baffin region, Kivalliq has gold mines opening, and in the Kitikmeot, I think the future mine is also for gold.
Will all of the projects have adjacent training courses?
To use myself as an example, as I am an Inuk and if I wanted to training to get a more senior position, then what kind of training could be provided so that I could succeed? What type of assistance can the Department of Economic Development offer for prospective workers?
Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank you for your good questions. Economic Development is not alone in this.
It’s interdepartmental through education, mining training, and trades. I think it’s also important to acknowledge that mines are at different times and we look at all those as a department. There’s active and advanced development under construction.
You take all those into consideration while working with the different departments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Oral Questions.
Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.
Question 131 – 5(1): Support for Health Centre Staff (Main)
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to ask questions to the Minister of Health.
Let me start by providing some background to my question, as this question applies to numerous communities and not just to my particular community.
I believe it applies everywhere in Nunavut as it pops up in various communities and it relates to our nursing staff as well as other workers in our local health centres.
We are all aware that frontline health professionals are often tasked with heavy workloads. This chronically heavy workload results from having too many duties, or to say it in English, a full workload. When workloads are too heavy, one nurse sometimes has to undertake these responsibilities, with part of the reason being lack of nursing staff.
When nurses are subject to extra work due to the lack of staff, it can lead to staff burnout, as a lack of replacement nurses results in more work for the remaining nurses who must still complete their tasks.
It seems quite obvious that staff shortages leads to some nurses being overworked.
It would appear to be quite evident in this case, and hopefully I am being understandable as I am speaking my dialect and I hope my colleagues comprehend my concerns here.
Perhaps I will reiterate it in English. Mr. Speaker, it appears that there is an increasingly cyclical pattern with staff shortages contributing to an ever-increasing workload and burnout, and so on.
My first question for the minister is: can the minister tell this House what steps her department has taken to provide additional support and resources, particularly to the health centre staff in communities which suffer from chronic workloads and burnout?
Minister of Health, Minister Angnakak.
I thank the member for that really important question.
I think the issue of staffing regarding health centres and nursing is a very important one. It’s something that we have always been working very hard as a department to ensure that we can have enough staff at all health centres as much as possible.
That doesn’t always happen.
I am aware of circumstances where yes, nurses feel very tired and very burnt out.
The department does what it can when we come across such situations.
We just had that situation in one of the communities and the department then sent additional nurses where we could.
You’ve got to look at where can be spare a nurse or two and then once that is determined, they try to send that nurse to that community where maybe the workload is more than usual.
It can be any kind of circumstances going on. Maybe somebody has gone on leave, and then the community perhaps came down with a lot of cases of flu or something, those kinds of impacts. What we try to do is we look at where else can we send some nurses from one area to another.
We’re always trying to recruit nurses. We want to make sure that we keep the numbers up, that we have enough nurses to deliver the health care service in Nunavut.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I thank the minister for her response.
I think we share this concern. In reviewing the department’s most recent staffing statistics, I’ll use the communities I represent as example. It is clear that vacancy rates remain unacceptably high in some health centres.
According to the latest statistics, Whale Cove has a 70 percent vacancy rate; Arviat, 44 percent vacancy rate.
I understand that this is a challenging issue and that it’s very complicated.
I would like to ask the minister if the minister could describe some of the challenges her department faces in providing additional and adequate staff in these communities which face consistently heavy workloads.
Minister Angnakak.
Our problem is once the 30 months is done, we can’t keep our nurses. They leave. They’ve had the experience and maybe the novelty has worn off, but it’s very stressful being a nurse in the community.
You have to look at everything when somebody comes into a community and what kind of support they have. This is something the department has been working very hard in trying to address.
Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.
I thank the minister for her response.
I’ll try to rephrase it. Mr. Speaker, we know that there are issues in some of these communities where there are chronically heavy workloads and chronically short-staffed crews of health care professionals.
I would like to understand specifically what is being done to address the issue in those communities specifically. What is being done?
What is being considered in terms of making sure that our nurses and other health care staff are getting the support they need from the department?
Hon. Pat Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I know you want the specifics, but I perhaps don’t have an exhaustive list of what’s being done because that’s operational.
We’re on, let’s say, an emergency basis only where people can’t make regular appointments” because maybe the workload is too much or too many nurses have gone away.
The department, like I said before, is trying to fill all the positions that we can. It’s difficult to do that because we’re in competition with the rest of Canada.
That’s one thing that they’re trying to do. I know that they work with an agency as well to try to hire northern nurses, people who have had experience working in the north, not so much always the Arctic but let’s say northern Manitoba.
There are different areas that we’re trying to address this. I know that the Department of Health is very conscious of what a lot of our nurses go through and are trying to help in whatever way they can.
That is not an easy thing. It’s not something we can solve overnight. It’s something we all have to keep working on and if you have any ideas, let me know.
Question 132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy on Government Assets (Hickes)
Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My next set of questions is directed at the Minister of Finance.
As we’re all aware, in all the communities across the territory, the government owns a number of different pieces of infrastructure. There are airport terminals, health centres, schools, office buildings, and etcetera.
My question to the minister is: for insurance purposes, are all those pieces of infrastructure lumped together in one policy or are they separated by need?
Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our insurance is broken into different stages and it all depends on exactly which property it is.
Each of our property has slightly different policies, and some don’t even have policies. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As I noticed recently in the news, there was an attempt by somebody in one of our communities to start a fire again at one of our community’s schools.
I know the Department of Finance has taken measures to make sure that our infrastructure is insured for the appropriate amount. We also learned that our deductible on schools, as an example, is $10 million.
What are the implications with our insurance provider if another school goes up in flames, Mr. Speaker?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our current insurance premium has jumped from $10 million to $20 million for our schools in result of the fires that have taken place.
We continue to advocate that through our Department of Education and through all of us to try to encourage people to prevent that. Those are very valuable properties that sadly there have been attempts of them being burned down.
We need to try to communicate and ensure that we show that we are doing our diligence through our security systems and through various… . We need to prove that we are doing better and we are trying to do better because the insurance deductible is rising and rising to a point where we have to insure it ourselves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I appreciate that information and it scares me when we talk about having insurance premiums of half or more of the value of a building.
I did ask what would happen if another school went up.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope that we will continue to be insurable.
This recent one of $20 million is a result of schools being burnt down.
For the rest of our other buildings, the deductible is at $1 million.
There are different varieties of this.
I can’t say before how many schools are burnt that we will be uninsurable.
I hope that under our watch that we don’t see another school being burnt. I applaud the questions and applaud our efforts to try to do this. Together, as all members, we need to continue to advocate that these are to educate our children and educate the public.
I think, not only for schools but even for health centres, those are very valuable properties that we try to run our services.
Any property damage causes a lot of grief to people that we serve. I want to continue advocating that our buildings are ours.
As our Speaker continues to remind us, this is everybody’s House.
We need to remind all of our students and all of the public that schools, health centres, and garages are all of the public’s buildings and they are there to serve the public.
I applaud and thank for questioning this and raising this in this House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Question 133 – 5(1): Increasing Educational Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)
I would like to direct my question to the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.
Mr. Speaker, in my member’s statement I noted that we, as the Fifth Assembly of Nunavut, have a new opportunity to push our territory towards a bright future.
Can the minister tell this House whether he would be willing to reopen the consideration of establishing a university in Nunavut in partnership with the private sector and others?
Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Minister Joanasie.
I also thank the Member for Baker Lake for asking that question.
Nunavut Arctic College drafted a request for proposals, asking different universities outside of Nunavut on ways to collaborate on various courses that we could jointly offer.
We started to develop a plan, although we were made aware that different bodies, for example, Agnico Eagle placed funds aside specifically for the creation of a university in Nunavut.
This work is something we would like to continue to pursue. However, we have tried to draft up an agreement with some universities outside of Nunavut on developing a collaborative approach towards this goal.
I truly feel that we must invest in expanding educational opportunities from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit such as that delivered by the Piqqusilirivvik program to higher academics such as the kind of education that would be delivered in a university setting.
Of course I feel that Baker Lake would be the perfect location for such an expansion.
Can the minister clarify whether he and his officials have been in discussion with the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College to develop a vision of how greater opportunities for higher education can be delivered in Nunavut?
Minister Joanasie.
Nunavut Arctic College shares that desire to provide greater opportunities for Nunavummiut to be able to receive a university degree in their home territory. What we have started noting is that emergence of online distance learning courses, as that is another avenue to research.
With respect to the matter the member referred to regarding Piqqusilirivvik and how more programming could be disseminated to the satellite communities, it is another idea which we are contemplating.
The board of governors of Arctic College will be involved in this initiative along with my officials. Specifically the Arctic College president and vice-president will be developing a plan to move towards this goal that can provide us momentum forward.
Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.
Mr. Mikkungwak: Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the previous government accepted a recommendation not to pursue the option of a Nunavut university at that time.
Will the minister commit to revisiting this concept and reporting back to the House on his findings?
Minister Joanasie.
Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for his question.
That option about building a university in Nunavut, people have different ideas about it.
Like I said, Agnico Eagle has earmarked $5 million towards a new facility if there is a will to do that.
I think it’s still an ongoing discussion.
Within this mandate over the next four years, I’m not sure if that is the route we want to take given that we just completed a fairly extensive feasibility study which we’re going to take into consideration and proceed as we need.
Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.
Mr. Main.
Motion 015 – 5(1): Extension of Question Period (Main)
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that the time allotted for oral questions be extended. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The motion is in order and it is not debatable.
All those in favour of the motion, please raise your hand.
All those opposed.
Therefore question period will be extended for an additional 30 minutes staring now.
Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.
Question 134 – 5(1): Grants and Contributions Programs (Main)
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise to ask my question to the Minister of Environment, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to ask about the Department of Environment’s hunting programs and I would like information on how they actually benefit our hunters.
Looking at the government’s main estimates for 2017-18, those programs are in three parts.
Let me speak in English so that I’m clear. There are three grants under the Department of Environment that are administered for disaster compensation, wildlife damage compensation, and finally the Fur Pricing Program.
The budgeted amount for these grants is $150,000 for the current fiscal year.
First of all, I wonder if the minister could explain how the department evaluates the effectiveness of these programs.
Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.
Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and for that question.
I know that that happens at least, I think it’s three times a year. I don’t have the details of that yet, but I know they just had a fur harvesters’ auction beginning of March. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.
I thank the minister for bringing up particularly the fur markets.
Mr. Speaker, information provided in this House in years past is very interesting to me and perhaps other harvesters in Nunavut.
In 2011 the Department of Environment stated that the value of pelts auctioned off to the Fur Harvesters Auction was around $800,000.
In 2012 it was around $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the minister could give us an update in terms of how the fur markets are proceeding this year in terms of the latest information that she has available. It could be this year or it could be last year. I’m interested in the health and the economic viability or state of the fur markets.
Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, have the same information you just read off actually.
I cannot say where they’re at because I don’t have the results of the Fur Harvesters Auction recently.
I can tell you that my hope is after the Northern Lights, it was doubled in sales when it comes to the industry and I hope that that will be an indication of what’s coming by way of the Fur Harvesters Auction. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.
I also thank the minister.
This is my final question on this, Mr. Speaker.
Can the Department of Environment make considerations to get more cash into the hands of our hunters to help them out?
We know who the fox trappers and sealskin producers are.
I think that the money that is used within a year is too small, Mr. Speaker.
I believe it’s just too small.
Can the minister agree with me on this fact? Can the minister check into this in the coming months?
I agree with you. I look forward to tabling one day to increase that.
Question 135 – 5(1): Compensation Program for Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)
My question will be directed to the Minister of Environment.
Mr. Speaker, we are all aware in Nunavut that our hunters’ equipment gets damaged, especially by polar bears. Their shacks get broken up and their important property like snowmobiles is damaged.
Mr. Speaker, there is a compensation program for damaged equipment, but it’s very hard to access that money.
Has the funding for wildlife damage compensation programs been depleted this year?
Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.
My apologies. I didn’t hear the whole question.
Can he repeat the question, please?
Speaker: Please repeat your question, Mr. Keyootak.
Our properties like snowmobiles and shacks get damaged, especially by polar bears, when we’re not there.
We all know that there are compensation programs for wildlife damage to property.
My question was: has the budget for damage compensation been depleted this fiscal year?
Speaker: Thank you for clarifying the question.
Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.
Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.
The minister said that she would respond after she gets the information.
Can she break it down between the Baffin region, the Kivalliq region, and the Kitikmeot region?
Yes, I can provide a breakdown of the list.
Question 136 – 5(1): Child Care and Early Learning Program (Hickes)
I would like to direct my questions today to the Minister of Education.
In his minister’s statement this afternoon he stated that all eligible licensed child care facilities will receive an increase and he gave a range of numbers dependent on the number, type, and location of the spaces.
Is there an overall budget associated within this range? What is the total amount that is being provided to our licensed child care facilities?
Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.
Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I thank Mr. Hickes for his question.
Cabinet approved the signing of a multilateral framework for this agreement. It’s a three-year agreement and over the three years I think it’s broken down by four different categories.
If you want specific statistics operations-wise, O&M would be overall $1.1 million for each year. It’s broken down into that.
That’s kind of the overall numbers I have.
I thank the minister for those details.
Mr. Speaker, when I’m looking at the daycare regulations for Nunavut, A manual for early childhood programs, section 17 in the staffing speaks to “For all staff involved in the delivery of the daily program, it is recommended to include training as one of the expectations.”
Mr. Speaker, I know there are a number of different programs offered within the Early Childhood Division as well as Nunavut Arctic College.
How is success measured? How is this tracked from licensed daycare facilities across the territory to make sure that training is encouraged for day-to-day staff?
Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes, again.
Training is one part of this agreement over the three years.
That’s one of the other components outside of the $1.1 million for operations costs.
We want to get more and more certified ECE workers that might already be working in a daycare facility.
It’s an area that we want to continue to boost. Training and ongoing training on the job are some things that we look forward to over the three years and beyond.
Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I encourage the minister to keep following up with that information.
When we’re looking at workers in our licensed daycare facilities and the training that’s available, I’m always encouraged to hear from daycare workers when training is available. It makes them feel more valued. It makes them feel more knowledgeable and more empowered.
One of the concerns I also hear, though, is the wage levels for people working in our licensed daycare facilities. Mr. Speaker, the turnover, as I’m sure all members are aware, is quite high.
When you’re trying to provide a consistent educational environment for our children before they get into the actual K to 12 system, it is imperative that there be stability at that level.
Is one of the conditions of this funding to be able to subsidize licensed daycare facilities for salaries to improve the option of a career path for our daycare workers, not a placeholder but a career path?
I agree with Mr. Hickes. I totally agree in that we want to prepare our children best for a successful start in life prior to entering the school.
I think part of that is we need to do our best to support our child care workers.
We don’t want parents to see an increase in their parental fees. I’m hoping that we can work something out and that this agreement will mean that our child care workers are getting the value that they so deserve.
I want to continuously work towards having that in our child care facilities across the north and across Nunavut.
Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.
Question 137 – 5(1): Inuit Content Requirements for Government Contracts (Main)
On Friday, March 16, I was speaking with the Minister of Community and Government Services.
I wanted to get clarification in regard to the number of Inuit labour content.
Mr. Speaker, it seems like the minister and I was in agreement and that he was in support of increasing the percentage of Inuit labour content.
The 20 percent is being used for the Qikiqtaaluk Correctional Healing Centre and also for marine infrastructure in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.
If I understood correctly, the Inuit labour content is at 15 percent and 20 percent.
Can the minister report to us how much they will be increasing the Inuit labour content for this tender, if the department is allowed to increase that figure?
Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.
I believe the member understands how it should be tendered through the department. The department helps the client departments.
When it comes to marine infrastructure, Economic Development and Transportation is responsible. If we’re talking about correctional facilities, we work with the Department of Justice.
We work with the client department to make sure that the contract is being followed.
We work with the client department and they figure out what the Inuit labour content it should be.
They try not to go over that level and we try to work with the “achievables” with the clients departments.
I cannot tell you at this time and, as the tender has already been released to the public, I believe it would be impossible to make that change now, Mr. Speaker.
Let me continue my line of questioning.
Now, if it reached the point of being unable to make changes to the work being tendered, are there any other ways to make positions available to Inuit?
Is the Department of CGS able to work on this type of initiative?
I hope I am being understandable here, Mr. Speaker.
Maybe I’ll rephrase that. Can the minister tell the House what the situation is for labourers from other communities inside Nunavut when it comes to seeking employment with a major construction project and are the workers from inside of Nunavut eligible for the same employer benefits that are received by labourers from outside of Nunavut?
Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you for rephrasing your question.
Mr. Speaker, in the NNI Policy, the requirement for contract authority assesses the following factors in setting the Inuit labour requirement:
The nature of skills required for work;
The Inuit labour available with the required skills; and
Other projects in the community that might impact the amount of Inuit labour force available.
Mr. Speaker, we encourage all contractors to first hire local, hire regional, and hire Nunavut before seeking employers elsewhere.
That is encouraged and asked of all of the people who come into Nunavut to seek employers.
We always encourage that and our client departments.
We work very closely with our client departments in setting these “achievables.”
Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the minister for his response.
As a final question I’ll ask for a commitment from the minister. Can the minister commit to working with the client departments involved, specifically with these major construction projects that we just previously mentioned?
Can the minister commit to working with these client departments to make sure the jobs are posted and that Inuit have a chance to apply on construction jobs from outside of a single community? He mentioned regional hiring and Nunavut hiring.
Can the minister commit to making sure that this is taken into consideration by the construction firms which eventually will win the contracts?
I believe that the Nunavut government as a whole encourages people who are out there looking for employers to first look within Nunavut to hire.
That’s the way we have always gone and that’s the way we will continue to go, Mr. Speaker.
Moving on with the orders of the day.
Returns to Written Questions.
Item 9.
Reports of Standing and Special Committees on Bills and Other Matters.
Tabled Document 029 – 5(1): Correspondence and 2018 Annual Report from North Arrow Minerals Re: Mel Diamond Project (Kaernerk)
Last week I tabled a copy of my recent correspondence with the president of North Arrow Minerals outlining my concerns about their proposed drilling project near my home community of Hall Beach.
As I stated earlier today, I will voice my support for these mining companies on behalf of my constituents in Amittuq, as there are not many employment opportunities available in our area.
Today I am quite pleased to table the response from the president of North Arrow Minerals as he appended the company’s 2018 annual report on their plans to develop their project.
I believe this project can provide tangible benefits and economic opportunities to residents in my constituency.
I will keep returning to this matter on occasion.
Tabling of Documents. Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.
Tabled Document 030 – 5(1): Correspondence from the Municipality of Naujaat Re: Four-bay Garage (Netser)
Tabled Document 031 – 5(1): Correspondence from the Municipality of Naujaat Re: Extension of Runway in Naujaat (Netser)
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to table two pieces of correspondence from the Municipality of Naujaat addressed to the government regarding critical infrastructure needs in the community.
The hamlet is requesting a four-bay garage. The community is growing quite rapidly and the number of vehicles has surpassed their garage space. Further, the garage that houses the mechanics for the hamlet is quite antiquated and they are quickly running out of space.
The other letter outlines the local airstrip and of the need to add a modest extension to their runway, which would provide a large benefit to the community.
The Hamlet of Naujaat has sent these letters to our government.
Tabling of Documents. Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.

>>House recessed at 15:54 and Committee resumed at 16:18
Chairman: Good afternoon, members. I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.
In Committee of the Whole we have the following items to deal with: Bills 2, 3, and 4.
Mr. Main.
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We wish to commence the review of Bill 2, followed by the review of Bill 3 and Bill 4 and the supporting budget documents.

Is the committee in agreement that we first start with Bill 2?
Again, do we agree?
Bill 02 – Interim Appropriation (Operations & Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 – Consideration in Committee
You can find Bill 2 in your legislative white binder that’s down below your seats.
To continue, I would now like to ask Mr. Akeeagok if you have any witnesses that you would like to appear at the witness table with you.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Yes, with your permission, I would like officials with me at the table.
Chairman: Thank you. Do members agree to have the witnesses appear before the committee?
Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could please escort the witnesses in.
Mr. Akeeagok, if you could introduce your witnesses and please proceed on into your opening comments.
On my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carlson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am here to present Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-2019.
Through this bill, our government is seeking legal authority to spend up to $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.
Mr. Chairman, at this time of year the Minister of Finance would normally seek funding for a full fiscal year. However, our Fifth Assembly only recently sat together to develop our shared mandate and priorities.
Because we would like our 2018-19 budget to reflect our shared plans and goals, I plan to table the full 2018-19 main estimates for the Assembly’s consideration during the upcoming spring session in May and June.
Until then we will require an interim appropriation so that our departments can continue to deliver the basic programs and services Nunavummiut rely on for the next few months.
This approach follows the budgeting process used in the year after the elections.
Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had an opportunity to review the proposed interim amounts. Our calculations are based on departments’ spending patterns and cash flows needed over the last four years.
We are satisfied the amounts we are seeking are enough to cover operations until the Assembly has had an opportunity to review and pass the full year’s budget.
In particular Bill 2 seeks the following appropriations:
$8.62 million to the Office of the Legislative Assembly;
$11.66 million to the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs;
$29.08 million to the Department of Finance;
$49.1 million to the Department of Family Services;
$32.44 million to the Department of Justice;
$10.77 million to the Department of Culture and Heritage;
$64.1 million to the Department of Education;
$85.77 million to the Department of Health;
$8.32 million to the Department of Environment;
$82.73 million to the Department of Community and Government Services;
$23.29 million to the Department of Economic Development and Transportation;
$73.39 million to the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and
$12.54 million to Nunavut Arctic College.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments.
I would be pleased to take any questions or comments.
I will now ask if any committee members have general comments.
Ms. Towtongie.
Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Just on the Inuktitut because I was reading Inuktitut, $32.44 million to the Department of Justice, in the Inuktitut, it tells me $32.44 million to the Legislative Assembly, “Maligalirijikkunnut.”
There’s a differentiation in the translation because $8.6 million in the Inuktitut also says $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly. “Maligalirijikkunnut,” I need a clarification if that’s for the Legislative Assembly or for Justice.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly, through this interim appropriation, is seeking $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.44 million.
I’m sorry if the translation for this document was inaccurate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, the English version is correct.
Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just have a general question. I know that with this interim appropriation, it is just basically a percentage of previous budgets that has been applied for and it follows the budgeting process used previously in election years.
I know there has been a lot of discussion around this House about the budget process, and the minister himself has said that there needs to be some fairly serious changes to the process to truly give an accurate picture of what a department needs to provide the services that it’s mandated to do to Nunavummiut.
I know it’s not directly related to this bill, Mr. Chairman, but it does have direct relevance to the impact of this.
Have there been any substantial changes to the budgetary process that are going to be upcoming in the next appropriation phase of this?
Minister Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for the question.
At this point there’s no direct change for the operations and maintenance process at this time, but I have committed that we’re likely to see the capital appropriations process this coming fall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
No more comments?
Okay. At this time I will allow members if they have any questions on the minister’s opening comments, please do so now.
If not, we will move on to clause by clause.
In the white binder that is below your desk, go to Bill 2.
Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.
Chairman: Clause 2. Do members agree?
Chairman: Go to Schedule on page 2. Schedule. Interim Amounts Appropriated for the Period of April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.
Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000.
Mr. Main, do you have a question?
Mr. Main: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I’m unsure if I should have raised this earlier, but I have a question regarding the departments that deliver grants and contributions funding.
My understanding is that these amounts represent a percentage of the annual budget, but some grants and contributions programs are typically spent… . The complete amount for the entire year will be spent very quickly following April 1.
I would just like clarification. When it comes to these grants and contributions programs, particularly economic development or Nunavut Housing Corporation, how is this issue being dealt with given that this budget is not intended to last for an entire fiscal year, but some programs are administered on yearly basis?
Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Main.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A very good question.
It’s something that, through this budget process, as in my opening comments, we looked at the last four years of spending by each department. Some of them spent their first quarter a lot more, especially on grants and contributions, as you have mentioned.
I can easily say that Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are the two major ones that you can see their budget reflection in this, that their grants and contributions are geared towards keeping the operations.
When it comes to application-based where it requires applications, there are certain things that each department does slightly different and that’s where we have been able to look at for the last four years each of the departments’ spending patterns by each quarter and our finance through. We analyze it and come up with and agree to with the departments in terms of how much grants and contributions they need towards this.
Chairman: Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.
Just as a follow-up question, can the minister confirm that it will be business as normal when it comes to these programs, or have there been any programs that have been placed on hold or placed on freeze, or is it just a straight across the board business as normal situation?
Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Main.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have given the departments that this has to be status quo and these are the amounts that have been given to us.
Hopefully by tomorrow we will have put our mandate which we will then look at for future spending, but before we are able to make these decisions as the Fifth Assembly, I have given directions to the departments and to our ministers that this should be status quo for the next three months. Come May is when we would look at those programs.
Ms. Towtongie, you had a question. No? Okay.
Sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.
Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, minister and your officials.
The appropriation of $491,804,000, there are figures above that on the top portion of the page.
First of all, to use as an example, in Bill 2, there is $8,603,000. In the minister’s opening comments, it says $8.62 million.
The $3,000 is not included in your opening comments, and there’s a total difference of $64,000.
Why is it written that way?
That is my question.
Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.
Bill 2, with three pages, those are the actual numbers that we are trying to get approved.
Those are the exact numbers.
In my opening comments, we just rounded it off. In English, it’s rounded up or rounded down and that is listed in the opening comments. I didn’t want to mention all of the exact numbers, so we just rounded off the numbers in my opening comments.
Just for clarification, the numbers that we will be using are accurate in the bill itself, so these are the numbers we will be using. He just rounded them off in his opening comments.
Again, Total Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000. Agreed?
Clause 5. Do members agree?
Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?
Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62(2), that Bill 2 can be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?
Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Mr. Chairman, I would just like to thank our staff for getting this put together to keeping this government operational up to June.
I really sincerely thank each of the members for help in approving this through this appropriation. I look forward to sitting here along with my colleagues on each of our entire budgets come May and June.
I just wanted to thank everybody for that.
That completes Bill 2.
I will now ask the minister if we can proceed on to his comments on Bill 3.
Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations & Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to keep my officials here. I would like you all to know that I will have to change my witnesses with the other items and I’ll be calling witnesses as necessary as we proceed, Mr. Chairman.
Can I start my opening remarks?
I appear before you today to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. Through this bill, the government is seeking to increase its overall appropriation by $56,602,000 as follows:
$49 million to the Department of Health, required to address cost overruns in a variety of health programs, including medical travel, mental health and treatment, elders’ long-term residential care, hospitals and physicians treatment, and TB screening clinic;
$6.2 million to the Department of Justice, required to address projected cost overruns within the RCMP, Corrections and Court Operations Branch; and
$1,402,000 for the Department of Family Services to address the projected cost overruns with Children and Family Services and Corporate Services branches.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to take any questions or comments. We are quite open for that.
Are there any general comments?
Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.
Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.
I see that number in the details, but it still doesn’t really give me an answer on where the focus… .
Minister Savikataaq, are you prepared to answer that question?
Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I don’t have exact categories broken down exactly how much and the numbers, but the two main categories are we’re sending more people for out-of-territory care and we’re also sending more people to visit the clients that we have out-of-territory and out-of-settlement care.
For example, if they have an elder in Igloolik or Gjoa Haven or down in Ottawa, then we pay for the people to go visit clients.
These are not our clients that are going down to go do the visiting.
Those two are the main categories, so more people being sent out for treatment, elders’ care, and out-of-territory care for people who can’t get the services within Nunavut and more people travelling to visit people who are out of the community care.
With the consolidation of senior services last year of bringing all Family Services responsibility for seniors back into the Department of Health, are there currently any senior programs through Family Services that they’re still having expenditures on?
I believe our minister just mentioned that some of them are not necessarily Family Services care, under their care.
Some of them are under health care and those are an example of seniors who are under health care that families want to travel and go see them. There’s a program that’s available through Family Services and that program would be used.
That’s one of the examples. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I realize that from a family visit or the visiting people in residential care does fall under Family Services.
Just a clarification on the question that I asked, are there still any seniors being provided any type of care through Family Services that hasn’t been transferred over to the Department of Health?
Minister Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Based on the information that I currently have, anything that was to be transferred to Health has been transferred to Health.
There are budgets for Health towards that. Anything that was not transferred back to Health is still run as Family Services.
That’s the two distinctions, but for whether there are any programs that haven’t gone to Family Services, looking through the information and looking at our business plans, I don’t think there are any outstanding programs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I don’t know if you’re as confused as I am about that response, but maybe if the minister would care to redirect his question to the minister responsible to get some clarity, it might be appreciated.
It’s up to Minister Akeeagok if he wants to redirect the question and I’ll leave it up to him.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll try to clarify.
The question that I thought I asked was, “Are there programs that are in Health that are supposed to be in Family Services or in Family Services that are supposed to be in Health?”
The answer that I provided was what’s in Health is there when it comes to senior care, what’s there right now.
What’s in Family Services is in Family Services.
This supplementary appropriation is focused on what Family Services has over-expended. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate that response and clarification from the minister.
I do understand now.
Maybe I’m asking the question a little bit unclear.
Does the Department of Family Services still have any senior programs under its responsibility?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, there are programs that are geared towards seniors and if I missed any programs, through you, I’ll ask our family services minister.
The programs that I’m currently aware of are the Senior Fuel Subsidy program, the income assistance for seniors, and Family Services may have clients that are over 60. Those are the programs that Family Services would be operating.
If I did miss anything, I would ask that I have Minister Savikataaq assist me on this question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I thank both ministers for that clarification.
I just have, I believe, one final question.
When somebody is sent outside of the territory to receive care, are they still eligible for income support? If they are in a southern facility, are they still getting income support?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Through you, I’ll ask for Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman: Thank you, minister.
It really depends on the situation. It’s case by case.
There may be some instances where they would be allowed on income support, but I can’t give a broad statement.
I have a question here on the details.
Within the department, it indicates that they are reallocating budget surpluses from other divisions.
With that occurring, does that impact the other divisions that should be benefiting all Nunavummiut?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Overall it does have an impact in terms of divisions that haven’t spent.
In terms of Family Services, the bulk of that that they transferred over to help with their overruns would be on income assistance.
If there is not as much income assistance, then you transfer it over to another branch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I thank the minister for his response.
When you are reallocating budgets from various divisions, when do you identify that they may get into a deficit situation and how is that deficit taken care of?
I’m not sure what that has to do with the process we’re doing here today, but Mr. Akeeagok.
Our departments provide a variance report on a monthly basis and it’s towards of the end of the fiscal year that once we start seeing any cost overruns, those are the ones we ask departments to realign their budgets. If they can’t physically do that, then we would have to go through the supplementary appropriation that is here for us right now.
Again, we’re on page 4.
Mr. Main.
The material provided here makes reference to the fact that this residential care service is demand-driven. The number of clients is increased from 189 to 243.
Is this a trend that’s expected to continue?
What caused this increase?
Do we know the root cause of this sudden increase in the number clients?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It has been a trend since 2013. It has been a steady trend in terms of the clients that have been required. This is a trend that we follow.
If that’s a trend that has been in place for a number of years, will it be taken into account when we’re going forward from this point in terms of looking forward to next year, looking forward to not approving a supplementary appropriation because the correct amount will be budgeted in the first place?
Is that trend being taken into account?
I think we’re going to go through each of the pages and we can speak to the trends. When there are trends that are happening and can’t meet the budgetary, we then start looking at our own budgets.
That’s a very valuable question that we will be expecting when we present our main estimates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Also in the materials provided here, it makes reference to the fact that within the department, there is less available surplus.
It makes reference to the department’s recent and ongoing income assistance reforms.
I wonder if the minister could clarify: where have those surpluses been eaten up? Is it in the administration of the Income Assistance Program or is there more money going to these income assistance clients?
Just a general indication would suffice.
I’m trying to understand: where is that money being directed?
Are the income assistance reforms… ? Does it mean that we’re heavier on the administrative side or does it actually meant that we’re providing more funds to the income assistance clients? Where is that money going?
Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there are a number of factors when it comes to Family Services.
The programs, over the transition in terms of when it was moved out from another department, a lot of the work was trying to figure out who’s doing the work and how do you do the work.
The recent income support reform that’s taking place has a contribution to this and the government’s response to residential services in terms of sending out clients and ensuring that clients are going. There are different kinds of care that are being transferred.
There are a number of factors, I think, in terms of how Family Services have come to the point that there are budget shortfalls for this fiscal year. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I’ll rephrase this.
This information indicates that the department is spending more of the money that is budgeted on income assistance, right? They’re spending more than they have in past years.
Where is that additional spending going? Is it going toward their own staff? Is it going to the clients?
Through you, Minister Savikataaq is better able to respond to the question.
Mr. Savikataaq, if you could, please.
The income support reforms that were done directly affect the amount of money that is spent. The best example I can come up with is the child tax benefit.
Before the reforms came into place, the amount that a family received for child tax benefit was considered income and was deducted from the amount that would be paid out in income support.
After the reforms, it’s not considered income, so the calculations that are made for the clients are that they get more money. The clients of income support are getting more money if they are within a family group. The bottom line is that the child tax benefit is not considered income for income support calculations, so therefore there is more income support money being paid out to the clients.
We are at Total Children and Family Services.

Mr. Netser.
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome, minister.
It states in here, purchase of new equipment for the test on new drugs. Is this anticipation of the federal legislation on cannabis this coming summer?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Through you, Mr. Chairman, if I could ask of switching my witness, I would like the Deputy Minister of Justice to sit next to me in replacement of my ADM. If I could have that first and then I’ll respond to the member’s question.
Do members agree to change witnesses at the witness table?
Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could please escort the witness in.
For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, if you could please introduce your witness.
On my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.
With your permission, I can now respond to the question that was just asked.
Mr. Chairman, that is a very good question for the law enforcement in terms of drugs.
No, that is not in relation to cannabis.
There has been a big opioid crisis in Canada and hopefully it won’t land in Nunavut, but these are the new drugs that are coming out that they need to learn and enforce.
In December, as finance ministers met, a lot of the money that will be received through cannabis, the 25 percent that the federal government had asked for is going to go towards the RCMP law enforcement in terms of testing for cannabis.
There are two components to it.
I thank the minister for the answer.
The other question that I have is on our packages, it goes the high cost of housing due to a lack of housing in the communities.
Could the minister explain why this is there? What are the high housing costs for?
Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Netser.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This one is related to the RCMP. They hired nine additional members to their force in various communities and as a result, they do offer staff housing.
When there are additional members, as part of the government contracts, we also have to find staff housing towards it. The additional cost for finding that housing was in the range of $300,000. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Main, you had a question?
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The minister mentioned, under this item here which is $2.6 million, how it has been broken down in here, he mentioned about $300,000 was for housing.
I wonder if he could break that figure down further into the different components.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I may miss a number.
If I do, I do ask assistance from our staff here.
Those are the numbers that I have rounded.
Qujannamiik, Mr. Chairman.
I thank the minister. You mentioned earlier that $1 million is for vehicle replacements.
Why weren’t you expecting to have to purchase them?
They should have already been included in the budget.
You said it was for new vehicle purchases.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you. That’s a good question.
The $1 million is for replacement of vehicles.
We have a contract with the RCMP and in that contract they receive any equipment that is needed.
Last year the vehicles were not really replaced because of lack of funding.
They were trying to delay the replacement of vehicles. This year, with the vehicles that are breaking down, they had to purchase the new vehicles.
That’s why it’s such a sharp increase from last year.
They were holding back on the purchase of vehicles, but the vehicles are aging.
The contract with the RCMP doesn’t really indicate whether or not we need to purchase this or we need to purchase that.
During our discussions with them to plan the budgets, they come to an agreement and that’s how it’s such a big increase.
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It also states here… . Well, my colleague mentioned this.
The new drugs are the most dangerous.
Is the testing equipment for those drugs for all the communities or only some of the communities?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, every officer will have these packages and for all the communities, a number of things.
Those are the new equipment that they needed to purchase for the officers and for the public that may get into that situation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Are they starting to find the new drugs that are more dangerous in our communities, and is that why they planned for it? Alternatively, if they are not finding the new drugs, which communities has the RCMP found those drugs in to date?
The new drugs are coming into our communities and this is very bad news. I wish they could be stopped.
There have been two communities that have been affected. Any new drugs that come into Canada would start coming here and they’re already in the NWT.
Those drugs are very dangerous. I fear for those who want to take drugs.
It’s dangerous because they’re now coming into our communities and I applaud the RCMP for preparing for this.
Mr. Main: I thought I was done here.
I just have a final question.
It mentions here the high housing cost due lack of housing in the communities. Does that mean Nunavut? What’s “the communities”?
It is written in the documents we have provided that we have nine new police officers that have been placed in six Nunavut communities and they need housing.
It’s just a general comment.
Moving on. Mr. Hickes, you had a question?
In the $2.6 million request, it speaks to increased demand for extra judicial officers and interpreters, and it states that seven additional judicial officers have been hired. Have any additional interpreters had to be hired out of this as well?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Currently no, there haven’t been additional interpreters and there are a number of factors that they had done in terms of not hiring. One of the major components is having trained, qualified interpreters that are in the legal or judicial role.
I’ll leave that alone. I’ll go over to where it’s talking about in the program 1 again, it is talking about the new radio system that these dollars are being used to keep the old system running.
With the knowledge that there’s a new system that’s going to be needed to replace the existing system, are there budgeted dollars forthcoming for the new system or is that going to be a supplementary appropriation next time when they know what the actual figures are from the RCMP?
Yes, this is currently being planned by our department. We will be asking for an appropriation and we’re in the planning stages for that.
During our finance ministers’ meeting, the public service minister was also there and he rolled out the plans for the RCMP if and when the cannabis legislation is passed. There are a number of things, as my member colleague has mentioned, for road tests and other. There are plans towards it, but there’s nothing in this supplementary appropriation towards cannabis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In program 3, the correctional facilities on the overtime, it speaks to each correctional centre has to have a full squad on duty every hour of every day. What is a full squad here at the BCC?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Eight. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Did he say eight?
Mr. Hickes: That leads me to my next question where the example provided on what is needed for overtime it states that the BCC alone, for a three-day blizzard, costs $180,000. I think I’m in the wrong career, Mr. Chairman.
Maybe the minister may want to clarify that number.
Through you, may I ask for Deputy MacKay to respond to this question?
Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
There are many staff other than the squad that are on duty. If there is a storm, then all of those people have to stay in the facility and another shift is called in as well, so that adds to the overtime costs.
Just a clarification, the way I understand it, if there is a blizzard, the staff that are on duty aren’t able to make it home, so they have stay, yet he stated that there is another shift that is called in at the same time, so they’re double staffed during a storm, just to clarify.
Mr. MacKay, for clarification, please.
Yes, we’re double staffed. They will call in the other shift when they think a storm is going to occur and they will come in and so they are double staffed for a period of time.
Mr. Lightstone.
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My question for Justice, for program 1, RCMP, you have identified the need for housing for nine additional regular members.
Is staff housing provided for each RCMP member?
It was one of our staff that has caused this, but it was in a friendly game of hockey. It wasn’t at the workplace. I hope for a full recovery of my deputy minister, who can’t write right now.
He’s got to whisper to me.
For the question that is related to the nine members, the RCMP procures their staff housing through the federal program.
I don’t know if I mentioned this, but we do have a unique relationship with the RCMP through a contract.
For those that were in the standing committee, I just want to clarify that 70 percent of the RCMP cost is borne by this government and 30 percent is borne by the federal government.
There are differences in terms of how the RCMP are treated within our public service. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I’m just curious if the RCMP intends on providing staff housing to all RCMP members.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When the RCMP does send out their members, they do it in a set time. They don’t stay in one community for a number of years.
Their operations are quite unique where they don’t keep members in one community for a long period of time; they do shifts.
Therefore through that, they don’t expect that their members will own their houses in those communities for the majority of the time. They pretty much match members with staff housing.
That’s the program that, through their unique operations, they do that.
When they do identify that need for a member in all 25 communities, they try to match with staff housing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I find it a little bit disappointing that the RCMP doesn’t encourage the members to become part of the community.
For the rare instances that RCMP members do buy a home, what does the RCMP provide for them?
Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Lightstone.
I’m not sure this is quite the line of questioning we need for here.
We can’t expect them to buy their own houses in our communities, which is why the service is provided by the RCMP, not even our government.
Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to comment on that, please.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Qujannamiik.
Very good comments, Mr. Chairman, on this.
I do want to give a very good shout-out to the RCMP. Even though they’re there for three years, their role is to help build a community and have a safe community, and they do a wonderful job on it.
In an event that an RCMP member does decide to buy their own house, there are federal programs geared for housing.
They’re getting paid through the federal pay system, not necessarily through our system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Last question on the RCMP is: how much is the total contract on an annual basis for the RCMP service?
On page 5 of the bill it states $40,071,000.
If that is approved, then $42,671,000 would be the contract for the 2017-18 fiscal year.
Thank you for that information.
I’ll move on to program 3, correctional facilities overage on permanent staff overtime and casuals.
Chairman: Mr. Lightstone, we’re only on law enforcement so far; we’re not to the other two line items, so if you can please hold your questions until we get to that point.
Right now we’re asking questions on law enforcement. Are there any more questions on law enforcement?
Mr. Lightstone: Yes, one last question on law enforcement.
In the minister’s letter that provided us additional information, we had a total budget of $40 million to law enforcement with actual spent of $30 million, with a forecast of $42 million.
I was just curious if or how law enforcement intends on spending $42 million up until the end of the fiscal year.
I would like to ask my colleague what number he’s referring to.
If he can give me a page number of what he’s looking at, as I can’t find it in the correspondence he is referring to. I see the $30 million in the letter that I provided on Friday, but maybe he can provide clarification.
A letter dated March 16 to the Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus, which was provided to us by the Minister of Finance.
It’s that letter that I’m referring to and it’s on page 4 of 5.
Thank you for asking questions about the letter.
The $30 million that is written in there has been spent up to now and they’re planning to use $42 million.
This is from a report from RCMP expenditures and what they think they’re going to spend. $2.6 million is the supplementary appropriation following the numbers we got from the RCMP. That’s what I wrote in the letter.
I’m looking at $2.6 million for program 1, MLA briefing notes, and it’s telling me that the RCMP in Nunavut is operating on an outdated radio system which is failing. At the top, background for requests, it’s saying that the Department of Justice is dedicated to improving operational efficiency.
However, due to the nature of its operations, a $2.6 million increase is required to cover needs for staff training, extra staff due to extreme weather, and unexpected incidents at the facilities.
What’s the situation here? It’s talking about $2.6 million for coverage on permanent staff overtime and casual salaries, then later on same thing, $2.6 million. It’s talking about an outdated radio system.
Can I get a clarification on that, Mr. Chairman?
This line of question was already asked earlier by another member, but Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to enlighten us again, please.
That figure under the RCMP, $2.6 million, I covered the breakdowns. When you go further down, there’s another section which is program 3. There’s $2.6 million on corrections too.
I think that’s what my member colleague is referencing. There are two $2.6 million that are being referenced here, one is on the RCMP and one is on corrections.
For the RCMP, I covered the radios, the staff housing, the purchase of vehicles, and the incidents that have arose in Nunavut. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I thank Minister Akeeagok.
If we’re talking about two $2.6 million, is that $5.2 million or $6.2 million? What is the total cost of this? I’m not understanding it and Mr. Chairman, if somebody could clarify it for me.
Chairman: Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.
On page 5 of our document, we’re dealing with law enforcement of $2.6 million.
Further down the page, it says “Total Corrections. $2.6 million.” We’re not dealing with it as a total right now. We’re dealing with law enforcement of $2.6 million on one line item.
Do you have any more questions on that particular line item?
Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that clarification.
I do have a question in reading Inuktitut. In English it is saying “Main Estimates” for the supplementary appropriation, but in Inuktitut it telling me “Miksautisimajuq.” That means that is guesswork of the estimate.
Which one would be clearer, the main estimates or guesswork, miksautisimajuq? That’s “almost what we’re requesting.” Mr. Chairman, can I get a clarification on that piece, main estimates for that year, 2017-18?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The one on the far left that says “Main Estimates,” the numbers that are bolded like the $40 million for law enforcement and registries is $11 million are already authorized main estimates.
The one on the right are what is not previously authorized and we’re still in 2017-18, so in Inuktitut, miksautisimajuq is this is the best guess that we have that these will be over on certain amounts. Therefore we are asking this House to give a blessing on the supplementary appropriation. I’ll use Justice.
For the overall, $6.2 million, of that, $2.6 million is for RCMP.
Those are the amounts that we are presenting to you to this House at this time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I was just getting confused in the Inuktitut version that these are the best guesswork that we have and the main estimates.
It’s almost clear in my mind now, so I’m finished with my questioning.
Again, we’re on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.
The next line item is Total Registers and Court Services. $1 million.
Total Corrections. $2,600,000.
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To continue on my questioning about corrections, every year the branch has a cost overrun and if I recall correctly, those overruns are due to overtime of correctional facilities.
Is that correct?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The member is correct. The bulk of it is on overtime and I’ll also add, on casual staff.
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
If I recall correctly, the correctional facilities operate on a 12-hour shift basis. Is that correct?
Now, considering that the correctional facilities are running on a 12-hour schedule and that’s causing considerable overtime, has the department ever considered switching to three eight-hour shift schedules and would that possibly solve the overtime issues?
Through you, I’ll have the deputy minister, Mr. MacKay, respond to that question.
The member is correct that there are 12-hour shifts.
Those 12-hour shifts are calculated so that it’s a 42-hour workweek. There isn’t overtime past the 12 hours and there isn’t overtime until you go past the 42 hours in a week.
This was a change we made, I think, three years ago with the collective agreement. That significantly reduced our overtime costs from 2015-16. It was around the $4 million range for overtime and now it’s down to a $2.1 million range.
Consequently the Corrections Division’s deficits dropped in that time period from $4.5 million to the $2.6 million you see here.
We are making some headway into reducing those overtime costs and we will continue to do so.
I would just like to remind members to please mute your telephones.
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Now, the facility operations run with a considerable amount of overtime and you base the schedule on 42 hours a week.
What is the actual number of hours on average of employees’ workweek? Was it 50 or 60 hours a week?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Qujannamiik, Mr. Chairman.
That is in so much detail that I’ll ask if we need to provide it to the House, we will provide it in the form of a written response.
Our deputy isn’t able to respond to that either.
We don’t have that information.
I didn’t know how far we needed to in terms of the operations of the corrections services.
I have questions.
What kind of training do they receive?
Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask Deputy Minister MacKay to respond.
Just in response, I think I’m answering the member’s question. In terms of training, yes, there’s a training component to our supplementary appropriation under both court services and correctional facilities.
Part of the reason for that is currently we don’t have people who do training as full-time staff.
We contract that out so that adds to the cost of training and then as this notes, that also increases the overtime because when people are training, they have to be covered by someone else and sometimes that will involve overtime as well. That does increase our costs.
Like everything else, we’re looking at ways we can better plan for that and better budget for that, for instance, by perhaps asking for extra staff that would be full-time training for both correctional facilities and courts so that we can rely less on contract training.
Ms. Nakashuk.
I was curious in terms of when we’re talking about a $2.6 million increase in getting staff training.
My question was: what kind of training is being offered to staff or casual employees? Are they also getting the training necessary?
In the case of both corrections and courts, that training is provided to all casual employees as well as obviously indeterminate employees.
When a casual person comes on, on a casual contract, it’s a four-month contract, but they will spend a certain number of weeks at the beginning of that doing their training. The training is geared, for the most part, at least for correctional facilities, it’s called NUHALT and it is terms of dealing… . Conflict management training is the main component of that training.
I’m not sure. Can I ask what kind of programs they also offer for people who are in corrections, or am I getting off topic?
I’m not sure that they will have this kind of detail in front of them, but Mr. Akeeagok.
Through you, I would like to have Deputy Minister MacKay to highlight that, if you will allow it.
Mr. MacKay.
As you mentioned, I don’t have the exact details in front of me, but I can give the member an overview of what kind of programming is offered to inmates.
It depends on the facility, obviously. For the lower-security facilities, for instance, in Rankin Inlet or the halfway house here in Iqaluit, there is a lot of trades training. It often involves the participation of employers in the community who will take on inmates as an apprentice or in a mentor relationship to give them skills so that when they leave the facility, they can take on employment.
Within the BCC and Makigiarvik, there’s less opportunity for those inmates to leave the facility, but they do provide programming that will address each inmate-specific need. For instance, there is programming available for addictions counselling or for anger management programming, things that are tailored to the particular inmate to allow him or her to be able to address the issues that may have put them into the correctional facility to begin with.
They are also training that, again, even if they’re not able to leave the facility, they do offer some training that will allow them to more employable when they do get out of the facility. For example, they will help them finish their high school education or can provide some foundation for trades training. We have a trades foundation course that the NAC offers.
They offer that in Rankin Inlet.
There’s a wide variety of programming that we try to provide for the inmates.
Ms. Nakashuk: I’m done.
We are on page 5.

Mr. Akeeagok, you wanted to make a comment?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Not a comment, but if you may, we are going to another department.
I have a witness available. Through you, if I could switch my witnesses before we get into questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I was going to give you the opportunity to change witnesses at some point, but if you want to do it now, that’s fine.
Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could exchange witnesses, please.
Do members agree that he can exchange the witnesses?
Chairman: Okay. Sergeant-at-Arms, please.
For the record, Minister Akeeagok, if you could please introduce your new witness.
The person who just entered on my left is the Deputy Minister of Health, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.
Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.
Mr. Netser: My mistake.
I was going to ask a question under medical travel.
Chairman: Okay. Thank you.
Are there any questions under the directorate?
I don’t have too many questions under this one, but when we’re talking about elders’ home operational costs, it talks about the three continuing care facilities that are funded and three different elders’ homes.
In a line of questioning the other day we were talking about the prefeasibility of the Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, exploring the option of expanding those facilities.
At the time the minister wasn’t sure of what number of beds was being looked at to start the prefeasibility study.
I’m just wondering if we can get an update today on making these existing facilities more efficient and where that prefeasibility study is sitting at right now.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question.
For this year, under the preplanning phase, we are looking at Igloolik under the preplanning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
What is that preplanning going to entail and what is the current status of it?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you. Through you, may I ask the deputy of health to elaborate more on the preplanning of the capital plans?
The Department of Health had preplanning money approved in the capital last year for 2017-18.
The preplanning was to look at the feasibility for making an expansion to Igloolik, as the minister alluded to.
Keeping in mind that an election happened and we expect that there will be a new government mandate, we’re still in the process of looking at what options we could do to expand Igloolik.
It hasn’t gotten very far at this point, but we expect that there will be further movement once we know the new government mandate.
More of a comment just to finish off, when we’re talking about utilizing government resources and we have identified the inefficiency of the current model of a number of our facilities, I would suggest the department and when the mandate comes out, I’m sure the government will have some topics on there on elder care.
I look forward to seeing some progress on maximizing the efficiency of existing facilities as well as identifying different areas around the territory where there’s opportunity for new facilities to meet and address the current wait-list we have.
Just a comment.
I’ll follow up with my colleague’s line of questioning there regarding the elders’ home operational costs.
I would be interested to see what the breakdown is of that $900,000.
Which facilities are requiring this money? How is it being broken down among the different facilities?
That $900,000 is shared by three facilities at $300,000 each for the three elders’ homes.
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m just wondering, because it’s mentioned in here, these facilities are operated under a service contract by non-profit Nunavut societies.
What is the procedure for these societies to notify the Department of Health that they’re going to have a cost overrun?
The figures relate to the three elders’ homes administered by non-government organizations, which recently got new contracts for continuation of services. This was part of that amount.
Further, if these figures are needed to be increased or decreased, the protocol is that the Department of Health meets with these societies to discuss these figures.
When they are required to deliberate over issues, they can do that.
They do have specific Nunavut and Canada standards, to state it in English, to adhere to.
It mentions in here that when the three elders’ homes initially opened, they were intended to provide residential care at levels 2 and 3 clients. There are a number of things that have contributed to the fact that it states in here that the majority of the homes’ residents have required more direct care and assistance and have been allowed to age in place.
Getting back to the budget here, is it predicted for the coming years that the cost of operating these elders’ homes is going to continue to increase or is it a plateau type of situation where we’re now capturing all the costs?
When these contracts were initially set up with those three elders’ homes, they were set up by the Department of Family Services.
The Department of Health only took over those contracts as of April 1, 2017.
One of the things that we immediately became aware of is that the standards that Health wanted to see were perhaps a little different. We were giving them a clinical eye. We had some differences in terms of how much care and by whom.
We had some recommendations with regard to nutrition, dietitian input, and so on.
When we looked at the contracts, there was no way that the elders facilities could provide what was required for those elders with the $1 million.
Each of the three of them went up to $1.3 million. $855,000 is what we expect it will be next year and we have asked for that through the proper budgeting process, but we’re in a deficit of almost $900,000 for this year and that’s the reason behind it.
Correct me if I’m wrong or stop me completely, but looking at the budget, I see a lot set aside for mental health and treatment contracts. What I don’t see and I believe what is happening all over Nunavut is trauma care.
We go through a lot of shocks; post-traumatic stress syndrome.
Has trauma care been discussed in setting aside budget items for it along with mental care?
Today we’re here to only talk about budget overruns and that’s what we’re trying to do in the O&M. We’re not talking about actual costs for other issues, so I think that question is a little out of line.
It could probably be better asked in the House or through some other venue, if you don’t mind.
Do you have any other questions? Ms. Towtongie.
Thank you for clarifying that. I appreciate that.
I was looking at the forecast for mental health and treatment contracts in 2017-18 and it’s $16 million. What’s the number, $16.7 million, compared to the budget of $6.2 million? What is the situation here?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That’s my final question.
With regard to the $5.9 million on the page we are reviewing and as per my colleague’s question, the figure of $43.1 million includes that amount.
This figure includes $16 million along with $10 million that is within the total figure here.
Through you, I would ask that Deputy Minister Stockley be allowed to respond in greater detail as to why the request includes another $10 million within the total figure. If you can allow her to respond to the question.
It’s really a good news story that Nunavummiut are asking for help, and that’s the whole idea of getting the message out of calling, going to your health centre, using the helpline, and asking for help.
We’re seeing that more people are asking for help and therefore more people are going out for treatment. We’ve had an increase in people going out for treatment.
We know that there is a high prevalence of mental health disorders; mental health and addictions.
There are cost drivers that are outside of the realm of the Department of Health, so clients from the Department of Family Services and case referrals from the Department of Justice. Anybody who is court mandated to have treatment would also fall under this budget.
We just finished Total Directorate. Before we move on to the next one, we’re going to take a five-minute break.
>>Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10
I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.
We are on Total Health Care Service Delivery of $43,100,000.
Under elders’ out-of-territory long-term residential care, you have identified the issue of dementia care.
You also mentioned that the number is likely understated because of routine screening for dementia is not available in the territory.
This sort of sparked my interest.
Is the department looking into making dementia screening available in the territory anytime soon?
It’s included in there, but it’s not one of the top priorities.
The mental health services are more important right now.
On the same topic of elders’ out-of-territory long-term care, the last bullet under that heading identified that prior years cost of this out of territory was absorbed by regional mental health budgets.
I was kind of surprised when the minister’s letter showed the breakdown of the budgets that the department didn’t include any internal funds to cover the over-expenditure.
Are all of the areas under the department going to be fully expending their budget this year?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, item No. 1, $5.9 million, Not Previously Authorized, that’s for the elders’ out-of-territory long-term residence. The main estimates for Health towards that were not identified.
This is something that has come for this year in terms of getting the elders’ care and that’s where we’re seeking that $5.9 million towards the elder care and sending them to the appropriate places. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My question was more along the lines of: is the Department of Health covering any of its over-expenditures from other areas within their budget?
Through you, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct me.
We find money in areas that are not spent and I think that was the question. I can respond that in areas that will be over-expended, Health has not taken anything out internally.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the clarification.
Yes, anything that has not been spent within the department, what we do through the budgets is take what’s not going to be spent and we put it over to those that are being over-expended and try to balance that.
The remainder of the balance for the Department of Health is $49 million.
In the letter that I recently sent as early as for the Inuktitut version that’s today and the English version on Friday, it’s an attachment that does not have a number which shows where the overage and under-expense.
If you look at what they plan to transfer, it’s quite small compared to the overage that we’re seeking for through this supplementary appropriation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I do appreciate the appendix where the internal transfers by branch have been provided, but what I was sort of referring to is, in the letter that the minister had sent us on Friday on page 4, it has a breakdown of program areas which require additional funds.
Under Family Services, they were kind enough to provide their lapses that they’re going to be using to partially fund their overage.
I was just curious why Health hadn’t done the same.
Health does not have anything to… . Any of their branches does not indicate anywhere there are going to be lapses.
Therefore what’s on page 4 of 5 is a true reflection of what Health is currently dealing with and it’s over by $49 million. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would just like to point out that the listing under Health is not branches; it’s actually programs.
I do know that there are a number of programs under the branches in Health that do have chronic lapses every single year. Even though they might be spent elsewhere, the budget still remains a lapse in that area, such as the nursing recruitment strategy, HR, IT. If I recall correctly, those each had $1 million lapses in prior years.
Would it be possible for the minister to give us a breakdown for Health of all the programs that are contributing their lapsed funds to cover some of these overages?
Again you’re asking for information that is very detailed which may not be available here today.
Minister Akoak…
…Akeeagok. Sorry.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for recognizing that.
We don’t currently have that level of detail here.
If we do need to provide it to the House, we will commit for it at a later date. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I’ll move on to the elders’ homes operational costs.
Under the second bullet it indicates that the current elder homes are operated under service contracts by non-profit Nunavut societies.
I would just like to say that is a great opportunity for Nunavut’s societies, I should say.
I hope that the department will continue to contract as many non-profit organizations as possible.
Moving on to the next bullet on the next page, under the topic of 24-hour care elder care, about halfway through the bullet it indicates that care is 24 hours per day, seven days a week, and that is to adhere to the Nunavut Department of Health residential care and facilities standards for elders’ homes.
These standards identify the minimum standards for the operation of elders’ homes in Nunavut.
I would just like to question if these elder care facilities are actually meeting the minimum standards.
I responded to this question earlier.
They have a new contract and the contracts have been increased because the Department of Health wants to make sure they follow the residential care facilities standards.
The Department of Health meets and reviews these homes to make sure the standards are being followed.
Mr. Lightstone.
I would just like to clarify again: are these elders’ homes currently meeting the minimum standards?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.
Right now as this is a new contract with this increase of $900,000 that we talked about in the $5.9 million that was discussed, there are minimum standards that are built into this contract.
Through working very closely with the three societies and the department, they will and are striving to meet the standards to the level.
Immediately not all of them are meeting the standards and it’s one that our health and that was mentioned and the minister has mentioned that they are working towards getting into meeting the standards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Netser: Thank you.
I had to clear my throat as I haven’t said anything in a while.
Mr. Chairman, on the medical travel about $15 million is being requested and we have raised it in the House many times about the atrocious medical appointments that people are missing, especially in my region where a patient goes down to Winnipeg and finds out that he or she has no appointment.
I wonder: does the department have a record of the people that have gone down to their medical appointment but have, prior to landing in Winnipeg, been cancelled due to some miscommunications within the department? I wonder if the department has any figures on the actual costs of these missed appointments, including the airfares and doctors’ bills. Thank you.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question.
Our Minister of Health has committed to doing this extensive review on the medical travel. This includes those appointments that were missed or appointments that the hospital themselves have deferred for a number of things.
I think that’s one that our government has committed to making sure that there’s a thorough review and find out which areas was at fault.
I think I remember his questioning and he’s witnessing what’s happening. It is a testament and we would include those in the review.
I want to thank the member for raising that.
Our minister has raised it and, through quick collaborations, was able to verify yes, any of those appointments that are missed are going to be part of that comprehensive review that our minister is reviewing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to whenever the review report comes out.
On the $1.5 million request for the TB clinic in Qikiqtarjuaq, recently on I believe it was February 26 the federal government made quite a lot of money available to ITK. It was something like $80 million. They set aside that money to be used for TB screening.
Has ITK indicated to the Department of Heath that we got a whole bunch of money from the federal government and told the Nunavut government that they have money available, that they could help pay for the TB screening?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.
That’s a good question.
Right now the federal government has indicated that for the 2018-19 budget, that’s the money they will use to help Inuit fight TB. It has been indicated that money will be given to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to use for the next five years to work in Inuit lands.
They have indicated that they have a task force comprised of people from Inuit lands and the Department of Health is a part of this group.
With respect to the extra money that was supposed to be given to us by the federal government for that purpose, I haven’t seen that as the finance minister.
We will be provided with the details, which I look forward to. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami does a good job and we know that they are familiar with our department and our officials.
That is where it stands at the moment.
As we hear the details, we will be kept informed as ministers. That was a very good question.
I would like to follow up on that medical travel issue.
It mentions in here that medical travel is driven by uncontrollable factors, including birth rates, demographics, contract increases, and etcetera.
In terms of this $15 million overage, does the department have a good feel for what is driving this trend?
The actuals are predicted to increase 5.6 percent over the previous fiscal year in terms of the drivers.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Through you, may I ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that question?
Yes, medical travel and medevacs are up every year.
We have a lot more people going on regular scheduled travel, which again is a good thing. It means they’re potentially being diagnosed earlier and they’re going for treatment. We have a huge increase in medevacs.
A lot of it has been driven by respiratory illness. We have very low uptake of flu vaccine in our territory. We’re probably the lowest in the whole country.
I’ll give you an example.
We expected probably about 60 medevacs in the Baffin in December and we’re budgeted for probably about 40. We had over 90 and that trend has continued.
We have such an increase in medevacs that we have been monitoring them on a weekly basis, especially this time of year during flu season. It’s mainly respiratory-driven, so people with pneumonia, breathing problems, and those kinds of things.
It’s a combination of people going out for regular scheduled care but also a huge increase in medevacs.
I won’t get into too much more detail here just in terms of understanding the drivers and the trend.
In the population on the whole in Nunavut, are health conditions worsening or are they getting better?
Maybe that’s too broad of a question, but I’m just trying to understand here: are we getting ahead of the ball or is the ball catching up to us?
Through you, may I ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that?
Unfortunately we don’t do very well in Nunavut. We have the worst health outcomes in the country among Inuit, as you know, mainly tied to the social determinants of health in terms of food insecurity and overcrowded housing, which is not helping certainly in driving the TB rate. Unfortunately we aren’t making a lot of progress and we probably won’t until many of the social determinants of health are addressed.
We just added some things like a fracture clinic at the QGH.
We are doing more here and we will continue to do that anywhere we can in order to reduce medical travel.
Things are moving in a good direction and the other regions as well.
When I talk about telehealth, it would be involved in all three regions.
You will hear more as we come forward with our O&M requests and some other things that we’re hoping to do.
Thanks for that response.
I look forward to the O&M discussion.
When it comes to this mental health overage, $10.5 million, on one hand it’s very encouraging because I think we all agree that we need to invest in mental health and it’s very important.
I’m looking at the material and it doesn’t really explain again what’s driving this $10.5 million increase.
Has there been a push within the department to diagnose more folks or doing more outreach in terms of what’s driving this? I’m curious.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Both, it’s diagnosed and testing that’s being done.
If I may, in the Fourth Assembly, suicide was determined as an emergency for the government to take action.
I think a lot of that action speaks through this of putting an outreach to our population and saying that there are services available. It is one that I think we need to continue to promote. Through the diagnoses, testing, and through proper care, we will see a turn of events for our population.
I encourage our members to continue raising that through this House and through the public.
My last question on this mental health heading: how many clients are we talking about in terms of clients that are receiving services outside of the territory?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.
How does this number 64 compare with previous years, the trend?
I don’t have the details in terms of the past, but it is growing and if we need to provide that further level of detail, we will be able to provide that, more probably best suited in the main estimates coming up.
I’m going to skip over to the Qikiqtarjuaq TB screening clinic. I think we would all agree that it’s a very encouraging project and that’s additional resources to address that need.
It mentions supplies and equipment. I was wondering if any of that equipment would be kept by the department in order to deploy in other communities or if it’s just small stuff that will probably stay in the community.
Through you, may I ask Deputy Stockley to respond to that?
Is that equipment that was included in the capital or is it… ?
I’m just a bit lost here.
If it’s equipment, in my mind it should be under capital. Maybe just a clarification.
Through you, may I ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that?
Much of the larger equipment actually came from the federal government.
Much of that came through the federal government. Other supplies like the bottles for sputum samples, gauze, the bedding, and things like that would have come through the Department of Health, as per our normal processes.
Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have one final question or I think it’s my final question.
Under health care service delivery staffing, it mentions the issue of the use of agency nurses and contract nurse services. It mentions that the department has made significant progress in reducing the use of these services.
Again, I’ll just ask in terms of this year’s expenses comparing it to previous years. What is the trend in terms of those expenses?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s about the same request.
Instead of having agency nurses, we’re having more of our in-house.
It’s almost the same for the supplementary appropriation. Comparing it from last year to this year, there are more in-house than there are agencies.
This is my final, final question.
A breakdown of that $8.6 million would be appreciated.
The breakdown is for 2017-18. For permanent salaries, the shortfall was under surplus lapse of $52.5 million; with casual wages going over by $45.3 million; overtime, that’s regular pay, premium, standby, and callback of over $15.7 million; and agency nurses over $0.1 million; with a total overage of $8.6 million.
I think I just have one question and it’s probably just a comment, but within the breakdown that you’re talking about, I’ll just pick up where Mr. Main just left off.
I’m not getting into the nitty-gritty detail too deep.
I know that if there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq that is dealing at midnight with a medevac… . I don’t want to look like I’m picking on anything in the way of overtime.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Almost all of it is by nurses.
I know the minister himself was answering questions today on what steps the department is doing to staff some of these nursing positions.
I’m going to leave that lie.
I’m just going to make a comment. When we’re looking at the types of appropriation, the health care staffing, the physician services contracts, mental health and treatment, medical travel, these are recurring supplementary appropriations that come forward every year.
The numbers, even looking at mental health, the budget from what I can recollect didn’t really change from last year, yet I think there was a $6.8 or $7.8 million supplementary appropriation last year.
When I spoke earlier about the budgeting process, what kinds of changes have been made, and the Minister of Finance did say that there haven’t been any substantial changes and I truly believe there needs to be.
When we’re coming back and having to approve, to go through this exercise of repeated supplementary appropriations when we know that the need is higher than what the budgeted amount is for, there needs to be a real reset button on the budget process so that departments can bring forward budgets on their actual need, not just adding a percentage of growth from the year before and “Bob’s your uncle.”
That is just a comment, but I would like to hear the minister’s comment back.
I share those comments very well and it’s something that we are seriously looking at as our Fifth Assembly and as we move forward. I think some of the discussions we have been having is exactly that. There are some departments and Health is one and Justice is another that continually comes back and asks for supplementary appropriation.
Something has to happen, and it’s one that I’m very happy that we are having this discussion on budget process and something that I’ll work very closely with my colleagues on this.
I know I’m answering some of these health-related issues. Right from the day that I got into the office, health has been a very topic of our discussions with finance. That’s a lot of attention that we pay towards health.
It’s one that we really need to do something about in terms of the main estimates of making some corrections on some of the very obvious things that have repeated over the years. It doesn’t necessarily have to change the budget process, but we should recognize these through our processes that are taking place.
It’s going to be through this House that we make a number of efforts.
One of our colleagues, in his regular member’s statement, made very good observations in terms of the budget process and I applaud that too.
It’s one that we need to work together as 22 members. That’s very needed.
This 2017-18 overage, I think, illustrates on some of the challenges that we are going to be facing as members. I would want to really work closely with you, with the Premier and the mandate, and through our processes throughout of ensuring that we don’t necessarily have to spend the time here because if we do know the actual appropriations that are needed by the departments, we really shouldn’t be coming back unless there are emergencies because we should know what our budgets are.
I wanted to make that comment and I thank you, Chair, and the members for giving an opportunity to state that.
I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I applaud the minister in recognizing the need to kind of hit the reboot button.
He mentioned Justice again being a repeat guest at this endeavour that we are sitting in right now and a lot of it stems from overtime. I’m talking about nursing. We’re talking in the corrections system and there are a number of other departments that repeatedly come back for appropriations related to overtime.
Again, I think there needs to be a serious recognition from the Minister responsible for Human Resources on how to go about filling this government’s capacity.
Filling within the positions that we’ve got in our org. charts, if we actually filled the positions, we would see where our weaknesses and strengths are. Mr. Main today talked about how the strain it puts on certain professions within our government where it’s creating burnout, it’s creating health issues for some of our staff where we need to take a step back and really evaluate what we can do to move forward to fill our government to capacity so that we know where our strengths and weaknesses are and we’re not playing catch-up all the time.
Again, it’s just a comment, and overtime is of interest to me and I would like to get some further information as we go forward on where some of the priorities and where some of the real triggers are so that we can look forward to finding solutions together.
Just a comment.
Mr. Mikkungwak, you had a question?
Mr. Mikkungwak: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just have one question here. On mental health, facilities, and treatment contracts, in your fourth bullet it indicates that although some charges are absorbed by Justice when medical travel is required, with that sentence, is that reflected in the $10.5 million?
I’ll try to make it short. Yes, it’s included in there.
Mr. Lightstone, you had another question?
My line of question falls back on both Mr. Main’s and Mr. Hickes’ questions.
The last item you have provided is the health care staffing budget shortfall of $8.6 million. Now, you have identified the current budget of $143 million and a requirement of $151 million to come up with that $8.6 million.
Is that for all compensation and benefits for the entire department?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, that is for all compensation and benefits.
Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Is that $151 million 100 percent accurate?
Are you foreseeing an increase of $25 million in salaries this year?
I don’t think any budgets are 100 percent accurate.
What I mentioned earlier, the permanent salaries, the casual wages, overtime, agency nurses, if I add them all up, I think what we have tried to do and which is the reason for asking for this $8.6 million is it’s our best estimate in terms of how much will be covered under the compensation and benefits. I think that’s the closest that we can get it.
I thank you, Chair, for recognizing that it can’t be 100 percent accurate at this point until we get through our public accounts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
That led me to believe me that with the year-end so close, that’s quite a large projection.
Moving on to the letter provided by the minister on page 4, you have provided a list of budgets for the programs and for medical travel, you had a budget of $63.8 million at the beginning of the fiscal year for 2017-18.
I’m just curious: what was the original main estimate budget for medical travel in the 2016-17 fiscal year?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Mr. Chairman, please bear with me. We’re just trying to look for the 2016-17, which I don’t have right in front of me.
If you want, I can go get that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to caution Mr. Lightstone that we are trying to deal with 2017-18 numbers, not 2016-17 or prior.
I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll disregard 2016-17.
The reason I was asking about medical travel budget for last year was I would like to enquire what the department is budgeting for medical travel in 2018-19.
Again, we’re working on numbers for 2017-18 and we’re not trying to look forward to what’s happening next year. I don’t know if Mr. Akeeagok wants… . He may not have the numbers, but Mr. Akeeagok.
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we’re getting too ahead. I’ll be doing a budget address in May. That will be part of the Budget Address for 2018-19.
We just voted on an interim appropriation, which would be of status quo at 2017-18. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I was trying to reinforce the fact that there’s an issue in our budget process and it’s proven on the chart that the minister has provided us. There’s a serious misalignment of budgets to actuals and it’s going to be repeating every single year until it’s corrected, which I’m hoping will be this upcoming fiscal year, which is why when the time comes, I definitely will be requesting additional information when Health comes forward with their O&M request in 2018-19.
I really would hate to see the Assembly continue to approve supplementary appropriations every year and just let it be as it has always been.
Hopefully, when the department comes forward with their O&M request, they will have the detailed information down to the level that we require.
Not a question, just a comment.
Chairman: Thank you. Mr. Qirngnuq, you had a question?
Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I need clarification on one issue on medical travel. I’ll speak in English so that it’s clear. Medical travel, third bullet, from April to December, both scheduled and medical travel volumes have increased over the same period last year. Can the minister clarify to me as to why it’s that way, Mr. Chairman?
That’s talking about an increase in medical travel and it has been utilized more for people falling ill, more pregnant women travelling to give birth, and so on.
There has been an increase in the number of patients going on medical travel.
Mr. Mikkungwak, you had a question? No?
Sorry. I thought you had your hand up for one more question.
We are on Health. Operations and Maintenance.
We just finished health care, $43,100,000. Moving to the bottom of the page. Total Department. $49 million.
Not Previously Authorized.

Go to Bill 3 in your legislative binder.
Sorry. I’ve got to step backwards a little bit.
We’re on Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018.
Supplementary Amounts Appropriated for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2018. Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Appropriation. $56,602,000. Agreed?

Chairman: Clause 5. Agreed?
Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 3 as a whole?
Chairman: Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62(2), that Bill 3 can be placed on the orders of the day for third reading? Some Members: Agreed.
At this time, Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very quickly, I really appreciate the questions that we received, the commitment on the budgetary process that we envision for the upcoming main estimates, and the hard work that our staff have done to put together the best estimates that are in here.
Through this, we will be able to revise our budgets.
Before we get into the other bill, may I ask one of the witnesses to be escorted out?
For her wonderful work, her reward will be to leave the seat.
Chairman: Thank you. Did you want a different witness in or no?
Okay. Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could escort the witness out, please.
Moving on to Bill 4.
Mr. Akeeagok, could you do your opening comments, please.
Bill 04 – Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee
Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appear before you today to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, 2017-2018, No. 4.
Through this bill, the government is seeking an additional $96,000 for 2017-18.
This supplementary appropriation will provide the Department of Community and Government Services with non-cash funding of $96,000 to account for the adjusted interest costs due to delays in negotiations and subsequent capital lease signings with the Nunavut Construction Corporation for the Legislative Assembly building and the nine decentralized Government of Nunavut office buildings.
I would be very pleased for any questions or comments related to this.
Are there any general comments on the minister’s statement?
I’m just new to this process. I would like to understand why this is required.
Is CG&S unable to reallocate some funds from within their own capital budget for this?
This is an accounting requirement. It’s to reflect the accounting of an interest. I think it’s more to be transparent.
It’s not related to cash. The cash is available; it’s just we need to account for what the interest rate was. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

On behalf of the Auditor General and all the accountants, I would like to thank everybody for passing this non-cash supplementary appropriation.
Chairman: Thank you.
Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could please escort the witnesses out.
In consideration that we have completed what we wanted to complete in Committee of the Whole, I will now recognize the clock and rise to report progress to the Speaker.

Tomorrow is the first official day of spring. As the light returns to our sky, we look forward to the future.
I hereby prorogue the First Session of the Fifth Legislative Assembly and summon all members to meet in this Chamber at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow for the opening of the Second Session.
Speaker: Before we get to Item 22, I wish to make a statement.
As Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chairperson of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, I am extremely honoured to take this opportunity to announce this year’s recipients of the Order of Nunavut.
On January 1, 2010, The Order of Nunavut Act came into force.
The objective of the order is to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the territory.
The order is the highest honour of Nunavut and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations, or medals conferred by the Government of Nunavut.
As of today, a total of 15 individuals have received the Order of Nunavut.
They have been recognized for their achievements and contributions in a variety of fields, including public service, the arts, education, language promotion, spiritual leadership, and economic development.
I am pleased to announce that two individuals have been chosen this year to receive the Order of Nunavut: Ms. Betty Brewster and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.
I am very glad that Mr. Pudluk is in the gallery right now.
Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.
As members will be very much aware, Betty Brewster is a renowned interpreter/translator whose career has spanned several decades.
In 2016 she was recognized by her peers for her lifetime of contributions to the profession with an Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit Language Award.
Ludy Pudluk served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.
During his many years of public service, Mr. Pudluk represented the communities of the High Arctic and was instrumental in the movement that led to the creation of Nunavut.
I am pleased to announce that the investiture ceremony for Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk will be held during the upcoming spring 2018 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.
The ceremony will be held here in the Chamber of the Legislative Assembly and will be televised live across the territory.
Her Honour Commissioner Nellie Kusugak will preside over the investiture ceremony in her capacity as Chancellor of the Order, and I look forward to all Members of the Legislative Assembly joining us on what I anticipate will be a wonderful occasion.
We will now return to the business of the House.

Conspiracy-theorizing megachurch preacher visits Nunavut
“The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight”

By Thomas Rohner Special to Nunatsiaq News
"A fundamentalist Christian evangelist known for conspiracy theories, climate change denial and marketing schemes brought his crusade to rid the world of the Antichrist to an Iqaluit church on Aug. 27."
"Rodney Howard-Browne, a South African immigrant to the United States, told his congregation near Tampa Bay last year that those who rule the world worship Lucifer and drink the blood of human sacrifices."
He preached for over an hour at an Iqaluit church to more than 100 people.
But his message is not for everyone.
“The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight.
"So if you want the fire [of the holy ghost], stand here [by the altar], otherwise you can leave."
"The choice is yours,” Howard-Browne said at the end of the 2.5-hour event."
About 50 people crowded the altar.
“I didn’t fly thousands of miles to come play games here.
"I didn’t come here to be liked either, and I didn’t come here for your approval. … Remember: When Jesus was raised from the dead, he had to ask people to leave the room.”"
"The mostly Inuit audience included infants, youth and elders."
"Inside the Christian Fellowship church in Iqaluit’s Road to Nowhere neighbourhood, kids ran around and played between the rows of folding chairs."
"Outside, the church and mosque faced each other across a small parking lot, both overlooking Dead Dog Lake."
"Howard-Browne’s sermon was part of an event organized by the Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association’s Arctic Hope Project, which is based in Ottawa."
The association did not respond by Nunatsiaq News’ deadline to a request for comment.
"The evangelist’s performance, number 119 on a tour of 300 one-night city stops he plans, began about one hour into the event."
"First, a local Christian band opened the night followed by Iqaluit evangelist and singer Looee Arreak, who helped found the Christian Fellowship Church."
"Eric Gonyon, an associate pastor with Howard-Browne’s Revival Ministries International, then held a 40-minute promotional session for his boss."
"Looee Arreak, an Iqaluit evangelist and singer, performs before Rodney Howard-Browne speaks."

“God loves a generous giver”
Gonyon asked the audience to provide their email address on registration cards and to follow Howard-Browne on Instagram.
He gave out gift cards for Howard-Browne’s religious products.
"And he plugged Howard-Browne’s upcoming book, Killing the Planet, which he said follows the history of corrupt economic institutions over the past 200 years."
"“It’s really the spirit of the Antichrist, is what it comes down to,” Gonyon said."
Gonyon then played an 18-minute promotional video of Howard-Browne’s evangelical career.
"Towards the end of the video, Howard-Browne prayed that those who donate money to his ministry will get credit before God for the souls his ministry saves."
"“God loves a generous giver,” Howard-Browne said in the video."
Gonyon praised his boss when the video ended.
"“One sows and one reaps and together we rejoice in the harvest, so that if you sow into this, whatever comes into this ministry’s account actually goes into your account."
It’s really amazing.”
"He then handed out offering envelopes and challenged people to do their “best gift for souls,” by either cash, cheque made out to RMI Canada, credit card or via smartphone."
"“I always tell people, don’t let the biggest cheque you ever wrote be for a Sea-Doo or a new phone … let it be to revive the church and win souls."
Amen?”
Many people filled and sealed the envelopes and put them into blue plastic beach buckets passed around.
Some looked at others and held the envelopes in their hands.
One Inuk woman folded the empty envelope and put it in her purse.
The call for donations comes in a city where poverty is widespread: Nearly half of Nunavut’s population relies on social assistance amidst long-standing crises in food security and housing.
"Howard-Browne did not respond to an interview request from Nunatsiaq News, so how much money was raised is unknown."
His net worth has been a closely kept secret but his website says he provides training sessions in 158 countries.
It also says people who enrol in his Aircraft Donation Program will receive tax breaks.
Gonyon told the audience to hold their offerings to Revival Ministries up in their hands.
"“Father, we just thank you for this offering, and we thank you for representing souls, that whatever comes into our account goes to their account,” Gonyon said."
Three one-foot-tall buckets of envelopes were collected.
Rodney Howard-Browne preaches over a woman who he is about to lay hands on.
Preacher counts Patterk Netser as a friend
"Fundamentalist Christian evangelism already has deep roots in Nunavut, with followers in almost every community."
"Bible conferences take place annually and, at least into the mid-2000s, were drawing bigger and bigger crowds."
"One advocate and organizer of such conferences, Roger Armbruster, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that the conferences are powerful magnets for those whose lives have been torn apart by abuse and addictions."
But Howard-Browne’s brand of capitalist and aggressive fundamental evangelism may be new to the territory.
"Patterk Netser, a long-time defender of fundamentalist Christianity and current Nunavut minister of housing and Arctic College, is what Howard-Browne calls one of his “Eskimo friends” who tell him climate change is a hoax."
"Netser declined an interview request by Nunatsiaq News but said, “Rodney is a friend of mine and we connect regularly.”"
"When asked to respond to Howard-Browne’s many run-ins with the media, which includes saying a U.S. Supreme Court Justice should be shot for insulting the American Constitution, Netser said, “What goes on in the States is none of my business."
My primary concerns are for my people and Nunavummiut.”

“Tonight will be fire on ice”
"One hour into the event, Howard-Browne—the main act—took to the altar."
"“Tonight will be fire on ice,” the evangelist said to over 100 people, mostly Inuit, of all ages."
"“If you don’t want the fire, you better make a run for the door now while you can.”"
"Over the next hour, Howard-Browne’s voice rose and fell rhythmically."
He paused for effect and shouted for emphasis at times. And he told jokes.
"“I know I don’t look like I’m African, but it’s only because my parents kept me in the house most of the time, they never let me outside,” he said to scattered laughter."
“Moses was the first one to use a tablet.
He broke the first one and had to go out and get another one.
And Adam and Eve were the first ones to use an Apple product.”
"Howard-Browne rose to fame, in large part, for his laughing revival meetings where worshippers were seized with laughter for minutes at a time."
"His granddaughter was visited by the Holy Ghost when she was two years old, laughing for 12 minutes straight, Howard-Browne said."
Howard-Browne has been criticized by many in the international evangelical community.
He has been called a false teacher who substitutes Christian teachings with frenzied laughter and hysterical emotionalism. Howard-Browne has responded to that criticism by saying those who insult him are insulting the Holy Ghost and are therefore bound for hell.
"Arreak, the Iqaluit evangelist and singer who helped open the event, was the only member of the audience to be gripped by laughter during the sermon."
"“This is not a funeral, why are people sad?”"
Howard-Browne said.
Arreak laughed.
“We are serving Jesus and he is alive.”
Arreak laughed loudly.
"“I like this pastor,” he said to Arreak, whose sustained laughter grew even louder."
Howard-Browne laughed with her as others in the audience laughed softly.
“Such joy.
"With joy shall you draw forth water, out of the wells of salvation.”"
Arreak’s laughter hit a shrill pitch and echoed off the ceiling.
“This is legal.
Nobody’s going to be arrested tonight.”
"Arreak, who told Nunatsiaq News she refused to speak to media, whooped with more laughter."
"Howard-Browne also spoke in tongues, which he claimed was once understood in the obscure native dialect of a Papua New Guinea pastor."
“Man-gah-no-ra-pa-ta.
"Ran-bum-go-pah-tah,” he said."
Rodney Howard-Browne calls the audience around the altar to receive the fire of the Holy Ghost.
Not all laughs
But not everyone found Howard-Browne’s sermon captivating or funny.
He lashed out at those who tried to leave before the end of his sermon.
"Before he lay hands on a few audience members, Howard-Browne harangued two people as they left."
“Where are you going brother?
Hey.
Hey!
You leaving?”
Howard-Browne said to one man as he quietly left the church.
"“You come in here, you were filming with your phone and then you leave?"
Are you the reporter for the daily newspaper here?”
The audience laughed.
"“I wonder what he would do if I would run and grab him and bring him back in…. Find out who he is and why he’s filming and why he left,” he said to one of his staff."
"As he called the audience to the altar at the end of his sermon, Howard-Browne seized on two women sitting in the second row because he didn’t like the looks on their faces."
“Are you guys born again?
"What are you, Jehovah Witnesses?”"
The audience laughed.
“I’ve never seen people so indifferent sitting in the second row.
"So you can either jump in with the rest, or you may be better than everybody else.”"
The two women stood up and began walking out of the church.
“I’m just asking a question.
"I do this, you know, this is my job."
I know what body language is.
Don’t scoff at me.
It’s not a joke.
The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight.”
Event staff told the audience not to take pictures or recordings.
"Meanwhile, they photographed the entire event."
That included running up to people who were sobbing as Howard-Browne laid hands on them and taking close-up pictures.
"A photo album on Revival Ministries International’s website shows pictures of nameless audience members at their most vulnerable—pained facial expressions, eyes closed, mouths wide open, or collapsing to the floor."
A woman on whom Howard-Browne just laid hands lies crying on the floor beneath a thin blanket.
"In front of her, Howard-Browne and his staff advance to lay hands on an Inuit couple."
Event originally scheduled for St. Jude’s
"The event was originally scheduled to be held at St. Jude’s Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but was changed at the last minute."
"That change came from those who invited Howard-Browne, a receptionist at St. Jude’s said."
"David Parsons, the Anglican bishop for the Arctic, said he was not aware that Howard-Browne was set to preach at St. Jude’s."
"And if he had known, he said he would have stopped the event because Howard-Browne is an extremist."
"In this case, local Anglican officials failed to follow protocol by getting the bishop’s approval before such an event, Parsons said."
"The Anglican church has a reputation as a caring, compassionate church and, at times, works closely with other denominations, Parsons said."
"“But there’s a lot of trust there, that you’re not going to be doing things that would, first of all discredit Christianity or the ministry of the people who are there.”"
Howard-Browne appears to take a different approach.
“I’m not here to appease religious people.
"If religion was going to shake the Arctic, it would’ve shaken the Arctic,” he told the audience."
"“I don’t go by invitation, I go by commandment."
"… When you have the fire, you don’t need an invitation.”"
"With little fanfare, Canada quietly launches new Arctic policy document"
Liberals claim new policy represents “profound change of direction”

By Jim Bell
"One day prior to the start of Canada’s national election campaign, the Liberal government, with little fanfare, launched its long-awaited Arctic and northern policy framework on Sept. 10."
"The document, which represents the first phase of a continuing process, will replace Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper government’s 2010 Statement on Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy."
It’s supposed to serve as a guide for federal policy in the Arctic until 2030—but it contains no implementation plan or governance measures to guide future collaboration.
"Those matters are to be dealt with in a second phase, the framework says."
"Notwithstanding all that, a foreword from Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations and northern affairs, claims the policy document represents a “a profound change of direction for the Government of Canada.”"
The release of the policy also comes much later than expected.
"Earlier this year, Bennett said the policy would likely be released in June."
CBC reported earlier this month that an announcement event planned for Yellowknife in August had been cancelled.
"At the heart of the Liberal policy are eight “goals,” with accompanying objectives, and 10 “principles.”"
"They cover a wide range of policy areas, including local and regional economic development, infrastructure, Indigenous rights, environmental protection, national defence and foreign policy."
"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on Dec. 20, 2016, announced his government’s intention to create the new policy, he promised it would be “co-developed” with northern governments and Indigenous organizations."
"To that end, more than 25 Indigenous organizations, along with the governments of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland-Labrador, joined in on the co-development process."
"“In co-developing Canada’s Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, our partners helped us to understand and reflect the unique opportunities and challenges within the different regions, jurisdictional responsibilities and treaty rights across the Arctic and the North,” Bennett said in a news release."
"And some of those partners have written their own chapters, which are published outside the main policy document."
Some chapters don’t represent federal policy
"For example, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments as a group have each respectively contributed their own chapters."
But there’s a catch.
The chapters contributed by the co-development partners may not actually represent federal policy.
That’s a sign the federal government may have run into problems finding consensus among the more than 31 groups.
"“While the framework chapters are an integral part of this process, they do not necessarily reflect the views of either the federal government, or of the other partners,” the framework document says."
"The document also suggests that where they did find consensus, it wasn’t easy."
"“The ideas, the aspirations, and the goals and objectives are the result of the meeting of many minds and perspectives."
This often meant compromise on the part of governments and Indigenous partners as we strove for consensus.”
You can find links to the Arctic policy documents at this webpage.
Eight goals
"Here are the eight goals of the strategy, representing what the federal government wants to strive for."
"• Strong, sustainable, diversified and inclusive local and regional economies."
• Canadian Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples are resilient and healthy.
"• The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well-defended."
• Strengthened infrastructure that closes gaps with other regions of Canada.
• The rules-based international order in the Arctic responds effectively to new challenges and opportunities.
• Knowledge and understanding guides decision-making.
• Canadian Arctic and northern ecosystems are healthy and resilient.
• Reconciliation supports self-determination and nurtures mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.
Each of those goals is fleshed out with multiple “objectives” listing more specific aspirations.
Ten principles
"And to help carry out all those goals and objectives, the policy document lists the following principles below, which were developed to provide “continuing guidance on implementation of the framework”:"
"• Decisions about the Arctic and the North will be made in partnership with and with the participation of northerners, to reflect the rights, needs and perspectives of northerners."
"• The rights and jurisdictions of Canada’s federal, territorial, provincial Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected."
"• Development should be sustainable and holistic, integrating social, cultural, economic and environmental considerations."
"• Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, is foundational to success."
"• As climate change is a lived reality in the region, initiatives will take into account its various impacts, including its impact on Indigenous northerners, who continue to rely on the land and wildlife for their culture, traditional economy and food security."
"• Policy and programming will reflect a commitment to diversity and equality, and to the employment of analytical tools such as Gender-Based Analysis Plus to assess potential impacts on diverse groups of people."
"• The framework will respect a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, Arctic and northern First Nations and Métis are acknowledged, affirmed and implemented."
"• The Government of Canada recognizes Inuit, First Nations, and Métis as the Indigenous peoples of Canada, consisting of distinct, rights-bearing communities with their own histories, including with the Crown."
"• The work of forming renewed relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership must reflect the unique interests, priorities and circumstances of each people."
"• Every sector of society, from the private sector to universities and colleges, the not-for-profit sector, community-based organizations and individual Canadians, has an important part to play in building a strong Canadian Arctic and North."
Nunavut’s Conservative candidate blames carbon tax for raising cost of “absolutely everything”
Leona Aglukkaq speaks about her campaign promises for Nunavut

"Nunavut’s Conservative candidate says that if her party forms the next government, they would eliminate the carbon tax because it “increased the cost of absolutely everything.”"
Leona Aglukkaq is setting off on a campaign tour across the territory.
The former Nunavut MP launched her campaign at an event in Iqaluit on Sept. 12 at the Frobisher Inn.
She then flew to Rankin Inlet the next day before returning to Iqaluit the following week.
Nunatsiaq News sat down with Aglukkaq while she was in Iqaluit.
"The carbon tax “has raised the cost of air travel, consumer goods, shipping, hunting and home ownership,” reads Aglukkaq’s campaign poster."
Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News the tax would negatively affect daycares and elders’ homes by increasing heating costs.
“Every business is impacted by a carbon tax.”
Aglukkaq said.
“Introducing a carbon tax while we have affordability issues is one side of the brain not talking to the other.”
"But George Hickes, Nunavut’s finance minister, announced in May that through an agreement with Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuel for aircraft operating within the territory are exempt from the tax."
The territorial government has also subsidized half the cost of the carbon tax for Nunavut residents.
"Aglukkaq’s platform for Nunavut has four priorities: affordability, housing, mental health and infrastructure."
“How can we as a government and private sector and territorial government work together to address this huge issue of social housing needs throughout the North?”
"The housing portion of Aglukkaq’s campaign priorities says she will develop a comprehensive strategy that includes transitional housing, elders’ housing and housing for those with special needs."
"The federal and territorial governments also need to consider boosting private homeownership, she said."
Aglukkaq said she also promises to invest in northern infrastructure projects and mental health training for Nunavummiut.
"“Nunavut is the largest coastal region of Canada and we still lag behind in adequate marine infrastructure in our region, so getting back on track with major investments of that nature in the North,” she said."
"“We need to address the need of building capacity, of training Nunavummiut to provide mental health services to support our communities.”"
"When asked if she would make changes to the federal government’s Nutrition North program, Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has made food more expensive through increased shipping costs."
"When asked if she thought the program was working and, if not, what she would do to fix it beyond scrapping the carbon tax, she said she would consult with the Nutrition North advisory committee."
"She said if the Conservatives formed government, that committee would remain in place."
“It’s important to have people on the ground from the North providing advice to the government on how to improve the program.
It’s not a perfect program.
Nothing is perfect in this world.
We do need a subsidy in the North for food.”
"Aglukkaq would not specifically say how she would address Nutrition North, but said a subsidy will still be needed on food and “removing is not an option.”"
"Recently, research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that food insecurity had actually worsened in Nunavut under Nutrition North, according to data from the Canadian Community Health Survey."
"Aglukkaq said her former experience as minister of environment would help her address climate change and reduce emissions, but did not specifically say how."
She said she would also support the Kivalliq hydro-fibre link and the Grays Bay road and port in the Kitikmeot.
“Will we ever completely not depend on diesel anytime soon?
"No,” she said."
"When Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer visited Iqaluit in June, he said the territory needs to develop its natural resources, something he said is “virtually impossible” under the current Liberal government."
"Aglukkaq said she is confident the policies already in place to consult Inuit on natural resource development will decide what will be, and won’t be, developed."
"“The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement explains how business gets done in the North…. The land claims agreement, in my view, is the most comprehensive environmental plan."
"It protects our land, it protects our waters, it protects our wildlife."
“It’s already set out in terms of how projects proceed.
And that’s a constitutionally entrenched agreement that we should be very proud of.
"And decisions about the Arctic should be made by people of the Arctic, not Ottawa.”"
"Aglukkaq left the capital for Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on Sept. 19, her office said."
"She also plans to make stops in Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River, before making stops in the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions."
MLAs to launch search for new Nunavut languages commissioner
Helen Klengenberg resigns for health reasons
"Nunavut MLAs will soon launch a search for a new Nunavut languages commissioner, following the recent resignation of Helen Klengenberg from the position."
Klengenberg had served as languages commissioner since June 2017.
By Nunatsiaq News
"Nunavut MLAs will soon launch a search for a new languages commissioner, following the recent resignation of Helen Klengenberg from the position."
"Klengenberg, who has served as Nunavut’s languages commissioner since June 2017, resigned recently for health reasons."
"Because the languages commissioner is an officer of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut and reports directly to the assembly, it’s now up to MLAs to recruit Klengenberg’s successor."
"They’ll do that through their management and services board, which is a committee of MLAs that looks after the assembly’s administrative affairs, Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a short statement this past Sept. 17."
"“I anticipate that the management and services board will begin its recruitment process for this position in the near future and will make announcements as required with respect to an acting appointment,” Mikkungwak said."
"The languages commissioner’s job, according to a mandate described in the Official Languages Act, is to act as a language rights watchdog in Nunavut."
"Klengenberg’s appointment in 2017 came after a lengthy search that took about a year, following the abrupt resignation of Sandra Inutiq in June of 2016."
Inutiq quit the position only about a month after submitting a report on the Qikiqtani General Hospital that found the hospital had no language policy and offered poor services to Inuktitut- and French-speaking patients.
She also said it took the deputy minister of health more than a year to supply some files required for her investigation.
"After that, MLAs advertised the position three times before they were able to recruit Klengenberg."
"In 2017, the languages commissioner job paid an annual salary ranging from $119,000 to $170,000 a year, with a northern allowance of $15,016 per year, 25 days a year of paid holidays and various other benefits."
National Inuit org wants nation-building effort for Inuit Nunangat
"ITK’s election priorities include reducing inequity, building infrastructure, Inuit self-determination"
Canada’s national Inuit representative organization wants a major nation-building exercise for Inuit Nunangat “comparable in scale to the development of the trans-Canadian highway or the trans-national railway [that] connected Western and Eastern Canada.”
Canada’s national Inuit organization has issued a clarion call to whomever forms the country’s next federal government: launch a major nation-building exercise for Inuit Nunangat “comparable in scale to the development of the trans-Canadian highway or the trans-national railway [that] connected Western and Eastern Canada.”
"In support of that, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has issued a nine-point statement setting out the priorities it wants all political parties to consider during the current federal election campaign. (See document embedded below.)"
“Inuit Nunangat remains the least developed geographic region in Canada.
"Inuit experience extreme inequality compared to other Canadians, and to other Canadians in Inuit Nunangat,” ITK said in a news release."
"In addition, ITK has also released a submission for what it wants the next federal government to include in the 2020 federal budget, which would normally be unveiled next February or March."
That budget submission urges the next federal government to continue implementing an Inuit Nunangat fiscal policy for the allocation of Inuit-specific funding.
"“ITK calls on all parties to commit to implementing an Inuit Nunangat policy throughout government, to ensure that Inuit are able to access and benefit from policies, programs and initiatives that are intended to benefit our people,” ITK President Natan Obed said in the news release."
Both documents contain ambitious demands that include:
• Connecting all 51 Inuit Nunangat communities to fibre optic telecommunications by 2031.
• Eliminating the infrastructure defect in Inuit Nunangat by 2030.
• Ending the social housing backlog in all four Inuit Nunangat regions within two years.
• Creating more addictions treatment centres.
• Creating more family violence shelters and transitional housing units.
• Spending more on Inuit mental health and suicide prevention.
The nine points in ITK’s statement of priorities are as follows:
1.
Action on social infrastructure and suicide prevention.
2.
Action on housing to completely fill the social housing backlog across Inuit Nunangat within the first two years after the election.
3.
"Action on renewable energy and climate action, so that Canada achieves net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."
4.
Action on strengthening the Inuit-Crown partnership.
5.
"Action on infrastructure and economic self-reliance, starting with the creation of an Arctic infrastructure fund, accessible to all four regions of Inuit Nunangat, with an initial contribution of $1 billion."
6.
Action on education to close the gap in educational outcomes between Inuit and non-Inuit.
7.
"Full implementation of the calls for justice issued by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, including the 46 Inuit-specific calls for justice."
8.
Action on poverty reduction and food insecurity.
9.
Action on advancing Inuit self-determination in research.
"ITK continues its traditional non-partisan position, and does not endorse any political party."
"In the most recent CBC Canada Poll Tracker report, as of Sept. 20, the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada find themselves in a statistical tie."
"The poll tracker, which aggregates all publicly available polling data, has the Conservatives at 34.7 per cent of popular support, the Liberals at 34.1 per cent, the New Democratic Party at 13.5 per cent, the Green party at 9.6 per cent, the Bloc Québécois at 4.4 per cent and the Peoples Party of Canada at 2.8 per cent."
The poll aggregator also suggests the Liberals still have a slightly greater chance of winning the most seats.
"The federal election will be held on Monday, Oct. 21."
Nunavut has a new polar bear management plan: NWMB
“We are going to do what we can do to get this in place before this season”

CAMBRIDGE BAY—The Government of Nunavut has approved a new polar bear management plan.
That was the news from the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board to members of the Kitikmeot Regional Wildlife Board at its annual general meeting in Cambridge Bay.
"The cornerstone of the new polar bear management plan is the one-to-one male-female harvesting ratio for all Nunavut subpopulations, the NWMB chair, Dan Shewchuk, told those at the meeting."
"The gathering in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife board annual meetings that he and Jason Akearok, the NWMB’s executive director, plan to attend."
Akearok said getting the polar bear management plan done has been “quite a feat.”
"“We are going to do what we can do to get this in place before this season,” he said."
"The plan has been under consideration for nearly five years, with a big discussion about the draft plan last March in Iqaluit at an NWMB board meeting."
The plan will be in effect until 2029.

"Of the circumpolar world’s 19 subpopulations of polar bears, 12 are found mainly in Nunavut."
There are quotas now for each of those subpopulations—and defence kills fall under annual quotas for each community.
"While the new plan won’t increase quotas right now, new total allowable harvests, as the quotas are called, will be considered as new data comes."
"Under the previous plan, Nunavut communities could only hunt one female polar bear for every two male polar bears hunted through an annual allotment of community polar bear tags. That applied everywhere except to a Baffin Bay subpopulation of polar bears, where a one-to-one male-female harvesting ratio was in place."
"Under the new plan, it won’t make any difference if a polar bear harvested in Nunavut is a male or female, as long as the balance between males and females is maintained."
Cubs will count as a half tag.
"The new one-to-one harvest ratio should allow communities to continue with defence kills, when needed."
"Polar bear incursions into communities have been an increasing concern in the territory after two deaths by polar bear mauling in the Kivalliq region last year—but, under the current management plan, the defence killing of a polar bear, when female, has counted as two tags."
This has left some communities with no more tags to count on after a defence kill.
"The new plan will also encourage communities to engage in polar bear deterrence, Shewchuk told Nunatsiaq News."
"But he has previously said that aggressive polar bears are harmful to Inuit culture and lifestyle, because of damage to cabins, bird colonies and seal populations."
Those at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed news of the change in the polar bear management plan.
They were also pleased to learn that Cambridge Bay will have five more tags for grizzly bears.
"A large grizzly bear was seen, and later shot, after roaming around an area close to Mount Pelly where there are many cabins."
"Elsewhere, the reaction to the new polar management plan could be mixed."
"Polar bears face an uncertain future due to threats posed by climate change, according to a 2018 assessment by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. The committee, known as COSEWIC, once again assessed polar bears as a “special concern.”"
That means the species may become threatened or endangered because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats.
Nunavut standing committee extends deadline for Bill 25 submissions
Committee will accept submissions until Oct. 11 at 5 p.m.
"John Main, chair of the standing committee on legislation, says the committee will extend the period for public submissions on Bill 25 and the committee’s review period of the bill."
By Emma Tranter
"The Nunavut legislature’s standing committee on legislation will continue to accept submissions from the public on Bill 25, An Act to Amend the Education Act and Inuit Language Protection Act, until Oct. 11."
The original deadline for submissions was Sept. 13.
"“My colleagues and I wish to express our appreciation to Nunavummiut who have taken the time to share their views on this important bill,” committee chair John Main said today in a news release."
The public was invited to make submissions to the committee after Bill 25 was introduced during the legislative assembly’s spring sitting in June.
It passed through second reading and was sent to the committee for review.
"The committee met last week to review the bill, along with submissions made by the public."
The committee also announced it will extend its review of Bill 25 during the upcoming fall sitting to allow for televised hearings for two weeks at the end of November.
"“The minister of education and invited witnesses will appear before the standing committee at the hearings, which will provide Nunavummiut across the territory with the opportunity to observe our deliberations,” Main said in the news release."
"Bill 25 calls for a phased implementation, over a 20-year period, of Inuktut as a language of instruction throughout school programs from kindergarten to Grade 12."
"At the same time, the bill would bring the Inuit Language Protection Act into harmony with the Education Act, and extend the deadline for implementation of bilingual education for Grades 4 to 12 on a phased-in schedule that ends on July 1, 2039"
"A detailed list of witnesses and a schedule for the committee’s hearings will be provided at a later date, the release said."
The legislative assembly will reconvene for its fall sitting Oct. 17.
Submissions will be accepted until 5 p.m. on Oct 11.
All submissions will be made public when they are tabled in the assembly during the fall sitting.
Submissions can be made to:

Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait — the product of history and determination
“It is a gift to our children today and the generations to come”
Here’s the Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait chart — a writing system for all dialect and all regions.
ITK says it does not replace syllabics and that regions can and will continue use of syllabics and other distinct writing systems.
ITK also says there is no expectation that people who already use older writing systems will have to change the way they write.
By Mary Simon
"I was very pleased to hear the news that the board members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktut writing system, Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait, earlier this month."
"Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means “united Inuit of Canada,” and there are few examples more powerful of our people taking united action to ensure the survival of our culture and language."
It is a proud moment for me.
"In June 2011, when I was president of ITK, we created a bold new vision to transform our education system."
"We released the national strategy on Inuit education with 10 ambitious recommendations born from a collective vision to see our children thrive in their formal education, while being strong in their Inuit culture and language."
One of the recommendations was to establish a unified writing system for the Inuit language.
It has taken Inuit in Canada decades to get to this point and it is the dawn of a new era.
The passion and dedication of Inuit language keepers throughout all of our communities across Inuit Nunangat made way for Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait.
It means that we now have a unified writing system that is compatible for use in all Inuktut dialects.
The introduction of the new writing system will be gradual.
"It is not meant to take away or replace the writing systems Inuit are currently using in their communities, but rather to be used as a tool alongside existing writing systems that will improve communication between Inuit."
It is a gift to our children today and the generations to come.
"I can now imagine a time when Inuit are communicating across Canada and sharing valuable publications and education curriculum, where capacity to develop high-quality education material is no longer an issue and our children are graduating from high school fully bilingual, literarily and verbally."
"History has challenged us as a people. Colonization ravaged our ways of life, our familial structures and our language."
But we are here today.
We have looked to the past so that we can understand who we are today and why things have come to be the way they are.
I believe that we are now at a crossroads where we can either keep looking back or begin to focus on the possibilities of our future.
The adoption of Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait for all Inuit in Canada tells me that we are ready to move forward together.
"During the eight years since the launch of the National Strategy on Inuit Education, we’ve been able to adopt the term “Inuktut” to mean all Inuit languages, no matter the dialect."
"For me, it has also become a symbol of Inuit unity. It transcends all our artificial political boundaries."
"Our language is who and what we are, and the health of our language lies at the core of our well-being."
My hope is that we can use Inuktut in all its beautiful spoken and written forms and move forward with the same determination we put towards our collective land claims.
"Mary Simon was president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami in 2011 when the organization released its national strategy on Inuit education, which contained a recommendation for the creation of a common writing system for the Inuit language."
Viens commission prompts apology from Quebec premier
"“Many laws, policies, standards or institutional practices in place are sources of discrimination and inequity”"
"Quebec Premier Francois Legault apologized to the First Nations and Inuit of Quebec on Oct. 2, following the release of a report on the discrimination they have faced in their relations with the public service."
(Screenshot)
"In this way, Legault said, the province of Quebec has failed in its duty to Indigenous people."
"Legault gave the apology—the first of 142 recommendations that came out of the report—in the National Assembly on Wednesday, Oct. 2, two days after retired Superior Court Justice Jacques Viens, who led the commission, released his report."
"Excuses are not enough, Legault said."
He promised to consider each of the recommendations and to look deeper into why this discrimination took place.
"“Many laws, policies, standards or institutional practices in place are sources of discrimination and inequity to the point of seriously compromising the quality of services offered First Nations and Inuit,” Viens said at the Sept. 30 release of the report."
"His inquiry looked specifically at the treatment of Indigenous people by police, the justice system, the correctional system, health and social services, and youth protection services."

"In response to the report, the Kativik Regional Government released a statement recognizing the importance of the recommendations, or calls for action, in improving the relationship between Indigenous people and the provincial government."
"In particular, the KRG urged the government to take action on a recommendation that videoconferencing be implemented for bail hearings for offenders in remote areas, something the regional government has been in talks with the province about."
"“The KRG is fully committed to working closely with all government authorities and other regional organizations to implement all the commission’s calls for action that fall under its mandate,” said KRG chairperson Jennifer Munick in a news release."
The Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services also responded to the report by saying that it addressed the concerns the board had expressed during the commission’s hearings about health and social services and youth protection services.
The need for funding and autonomy in providing health and social services for Inuit was voiced by the board during the hearings.
"“We now expect the Government of Quebec to respond to the report’s calls for action, and this with our close involvement in their design and application,” said executive director Minnie Grey in an Oct. 2 news release."
The board also expressed appreciation for the commission tasking the Quebec ombudsperson with overseeing that the 142 recommendations are acted on.
"Makivik president Charlie Watt spoke during the hearings about the Nunavik region’s process of self-determination, and said in an Oct. 1 release that Inuit provided testimony in all areas of the inquiry’s mandate."
"“Many times, in tears, my fellow Inuit testified to the commission about their experiences with the health, justice, social services, youth protection, historical injustices, and other interactions with Quebec government services,” Watt said."
"While he noted a full response to the report was forthcoming, “based on the first call to action—that Quebec apologize to Inuit and First Nations for the rampant discrimination found in public services provided to our people—we feel we have been heard.”"
Three parties vow to end Nunavut’s diesel dependence by 2030
“It’s super ambitious”

This federal election three parties are vowing to end Nunavut’s reliance on diesel for power by 2030.
"Currently, all 25 communities in the territory are powered by stand-alone diesel plants operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only energy company in the country without any developed local energy resources."
Changing that would be a massive and costly undertaking.
"“It’s super ambitious,” said Martha Lenio, an Arctic renewable energy specialist with the World Wildlife Fund."
"“I think it’s doable, it’s just barely doable.”"
The Green Party’s election platform promises to “implement a major ramp-up of renewable electricity.
"By 2030, 100 per cent of Canada’s electricity will come from renewable sources."
This includes getting remote and northern communities off diesel generators.”
"The Liberal Party, meanwhile, says it will be “moving forward with investments that will see all Inuit communities are off diesel and instead powered by clean, renewable and reliable sources of energy—such as hydro, wind, and solar—by 2030.”"
And the New Democratic Party says it “will set a target to power Canada with net carbon-free electricity by 2030…. Meeting this carbon-free electricity goal in a way that respects local communities and creates good jobs is essential.
"We’ll support investments in innovative community-owned and operated clean energy projects to keep jobs and expertise local, and work in partnership with Indigenous and northern communities to move off diesel.”"
"According to an Environment and Climate Change Canada report released earlier this year, Nunavut’s contribution to the national carbon footprint has always been less than one per cent."
"In 2017, the territory produced the equivalent of 0.6 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, roughly the same as 18,000 passenger vehicles."
"The same year, Alberta, which led the country in greenhouse gas emissions, produced the equivalent of almost 84 million passenger vehicles."
"Despite this, Nunavut has seen its greenhouse gas emissions increase by over 30 per cent since 2005, the biggest growth in the country and nearly double that of Alberta, which has the second-largest growth over the same period."
"While the switch to renewable energy proposed by the three parties would reverse this growth, the impact it would have on the nation’s carbon footprint would be minuscule."
It’s the communities that would benefit the most.
"Nunavummiut pay more for electricity than people anywhere else in the country, and investments into renewable energy could reduce that."
"However, the challenge with renewable energy projects is balancing their upfront cost with the pre-existing expense of current power needs."
"Last month, the WWF released a report that looked at how viable renewable energy could be in powering each of Nunavut’s 25 communities."
"It found that under an eight per cent discount rate—which accounts for the level of risk on a project or other sources of funding—Baker Lake, Coral Harbor, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet could all save money by transitioning to 20 per cent renewable energy, including upfront costs, over a 15-year period."
"The study also identified 16 other communities that with a four per cent discount rate—around what QEC would be able to borrow money for—and approximately $2 million in grant funding, could also make the transition to 20 per cent renewable energy."
"But the report just takes a high-level look at the viability of these projects, only suggesting making the transition to renewable energy if it’s cheaper than current energy costs."
Actually transitioning the viable communities to renewable energy would require a considerable amount of work.
"“There’s a lot of consultation that would have to happen, and it would probably need to start in the next year if they’re going to hit those targets for every single community,” said Lenio."
"“You would have to go to the community, work out what they would like to do, what the community vision for energy is, find out what other local priorities are and what areas around the community are important for traditional uses like harvesting and wildlife.”"
"That doesn’t include setting up data collection equipment for solar or wind, a process that can take two years for adequate data, or any work with the QEC to ensure that the renewable energy could connect to and integrate with their system."
"Transitioning all communities to 100 per cent renewable energy, as all three parties call for, would not only require a considerable time investment but a significant financial one as well."
"While the NDP and Liberals have yet to announce what their financial commitment to the transition would be, the Green Party did so last week."
"Included in their platform-costing report, the party pledged $150 million over the next five years to transitioning all remote and northern communities—not just those in Nunavut—away from diesel."
It isn’t enough.
"Lenio points out that for a community like Arctic Bay to transition even 60 per cent of their power to renewable energy, there would need to be a capital expenditure of at least $27.8 million."
"According to the same report, for other communities to achieve even a 60 per cent reliance on renewable energy, the initial expenditures are even higher."
"In Iqaluit, it’s expected to cost $148 million."
"While this represents a significant reduction from the $250-500-million price tag attached to the hydroelectric project once considered by the city, it would use all Green Party allocated funds on one community."
"Lenio doesn’t expect the federal government to fully pay for these projects, but added that finding project partners and ways to leverage the work also takes time."
"Given the 2030 deadline, time is in short supply."
"“For solar, I’d say the two- to five-year range."
"For wind energy, you’re looking more at like the five- to seven-year range,” said Lenio when asked how long renewable energy projects can take."
"When these timelines are multiplied by more than 25 communities and intended to happen at roughly the same time across vast, remote areas with seasonal access, Lenio wonders how it would get done."
"In spite of those challenges, she’s optimistic. “Hopefully with these ambitious targets, it will result in some positive changes."
"Even if we don’t make it 100 per cent of the way there, it’s good to have that ambition.”"
"Note: This article references the federal election campaign platforms of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the NDP."
"At the time of publication, the Conservative Party had yet to officially release their platform and, thus, was not included in the story."
Iqaluit’s Inuktut daycare calls for greater government support
“We must recognize how essential our early learning and child-care workers are to the Nunavut workforce”
"Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory, who is chair of the Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik (Iqaluit Inuktitut Daycare Society) board of directors, is seeking greater support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early learning and child care grounded in Inuit language and culture."
By Nunatsiaq News
"Open letter to Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq and Education Minister David Joanasie: Dear Hon. Savikataaq and Minister Joanasie,"
I am a part of a group of Inuit parents who care deeply about our language and culture.
"I am also the chair of the board of directors of Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik, the only Inuktut-immersion early learning and child-care facility in Iqaluit and the only institution in the capital city of Nunavut that sends children into the education system already speaking Inuktut."
"Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik was closed from Aug. 21 until Sept. 12, 2019, simply because there was not enough staff to stay open and, moreover, it has been operating under capacity for nearly a year."
"Not many people apply to work at Tumikuluit because of the relatively low pay (though the highest of all daycares in Iqaluit), little to no benefits, no housing and because of the social system that sees daycare work as low status and female."
"The daycare is now open again, but under a crisis regime: we have lost our long-time and amazing executive director due to burnout."
"We now have a part-time office administrator, a full-time daycare manager, two full-time caregivers, and each of the parents take turns to work at the daycare (all with cleared criminal record checks and vulnerable sector checks in hand), for a whole day each, while we continue to look for full-time, qualified staff."
"It is an unconventional system, but as parents, we believe in giving our children safe and whole Inuktut spaces to our children, so we are making every effort to keep the daycare open."
We are still at risk of closing permanently.
"The Nunavut daycare system is not sustainable. Child-care workers are expected to take on one of the most important roles in children’s lives by providing quality early childhood education, grounded in Inuit culture and language while being undervalued and under supported."
Our non-profit society depends on many different and inadequate streams of annual funding programs and parent volunteers to govern and oversee the management of an early learning centre.
"Our child-care workers are often on the brink of poverty because of the low pay and benefits, the lack of training on the job and the lack of housing."
Child-care workers are currently being asked to work for less than what is needed to support themselves or their family.
The adverse circumstances our daycare finds itself in are compounded by the unique skill set we require in order to promote and maintain Inuit language and culture during the most critical stages of our children’s lives; Tumikuluit only hires Inuit who can speak Inuktut fluently.
We have 100 per cent Inuit employment.
But we struggle with chronic staff turnover because we are unable to offer competitive wages and benefits to retain valuable staff.
"In turn, this affects the quality of our early learning and child-care programming."
Inuit must be sufficiently supported and valued to pass on our language and culture to our children.
The Government of Nunavut must consider how it can better support quality early learning and child care grounded in Inuit language and culture.
"We need to be able to offer our valued early learning and child-care workers competitive wages and benefits, which includes housing, vacation travel assistance benefits, and training–both on the job and in school."
Tumikuluit’s vision has consistently been to expand our reach and programming to accommodate more Inuit children.
"We have been actively seeking larger, more sufficient day care space to achieve that vision, insofar as to fundraise approximately $80,000 towards a new space."
We propose some of the following solutions to the Government of Nunavut:
"• Integrate early learning and child-care workers as part of GN staff so that they are part of competitive salaries offered by the GN, following the GN’s eight pay levels, on par with all teachers working in the Nunavut school system."
• Incorporate operations and maintenance of all daycares in Nunavut into the existing school system.
"• Offer comprehensive benefits to early learning and child-care workers, including but not limited to short-term and long-term sick leave, vacation pay, bilingual pay, parental leave and housing."
• Create a central body to support all daycares in Nunavut.
• Work with early learning and child-care centres immediately to address the crisis we collectively and currently face while we work together on a longer-term plan for systemic change.
We must recognize how essential our early learning and child-care workers are to the Nunavut workforce.
Our daycares must be fully staffed and all staff need sustainable employment.
We must keep our daycares open.
"With the necessary systemic change, Nunavut’s early learning and child-care professionals will value their employment and that will be a significant step towards achieving an early learning and child-care system that provides the best possible start to life for Inuit children, including the opportunity to learn and speak Inuktut, to grow up prepared to live a harmonious life rooted in Inuit ways of knowing, and to be equipped to participate in Canadian society."
"Sincerely,"
Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory

Do you recognize the people in this photograph?
“I do realize this photo is from a long time ago”
"According to a note on the back of this photo, it was taken at present-day Kugluktuk, Nunavut—formerly known as Coppermine—on May 18, 1930."
"The letter-writer, who discovered the photo in her grandfather’s things after he passed away, would like to know if anyone can identify the Inuit women shown."
I came across this photo in my grandfather’s things after he passed away.
"His name was Dr. James Jamieson, and what I do know is that he served as a medical officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, serving in Newfoundland and Goose Bay, Labrador."
"I am unsure when he acquired this picture, or who J.H. is (noted on the back of the photo), but I do know he had a lot of connections in the North."
"I do realize this photo is from a long time ago, but perhaps someone recognizes someone … and perhaps this is a photo of someone’s family and they would like it returned."
"Most sincerely,"

Inuit exert language rights at Montreal conference with Inuktut-only panel
“The name of it is Inuit Studies Conference so it makes sense … that we wanted to use an Inuit language”
"Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk, right, speaks on a panel entitled “Inuktut as a human right” on Thursday, Oct. 3, at the Inuit Studies Conference in Montreal."
"With her is Louis Tapardjuk, board member of Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, Nunavut’s language authority."
"Despite the absence of translation, the two spoke entirely in Inuktut."

By Lisa Gregoire Special to Nunatsiaq News
"A Montreal hotel conference room was abuzz on Thursday, Oct. 3, as people attending the 21st annual Inuit Studies Conference streamed in to hear two Inuit leaders talk about why speaking Inuktut in Nunavut is a human right and how that right is casually denied."
"Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, a former Nunavut government minister and board member of Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, Nunavut’s language authority, arrived on time and sat in two comfortable wingback chairs at the front of the room."
"Camera operators set up to live-stream the event to NTI’s Facebook page, a screen projection offered the audience various conference hashtags to use and a link to English-language speaking notes, and the mostly Inuit audience settled in for the talk."
Kotierk welcomed her audience and began the discussion in Inuktitut. Inuktitut-speakers responded from time to time with nods of agreement and applause.
"Those who couldn’t speak Inuktitut, this writer included, sat and stared."
Some people left the room.
"Some leaned over and privately scrolled their phones, waiting for the English part."
There was no English part.
Welcome to the bewildering world of many Inuit in Nunavut.
"“The name of it is Inuit Studies Conference so it makes sense, particularly when we’re talking about Inuit languages, that we wanted to use an Inuit language,” Kotierk said following the presentation."
“Both Louis and I spoke about it and knew there would be no interpretation but decided it was crucially important that we use our language when we’re talking about the need to support and continue to have our language thrive.”
"The international conference, which brings together Arctic experts from the North and south, has, in recent years, begun to include more Inuit speakers and presenters, more panels relevant to Inuit needs and more collaborations between Inuit and non-Inuit academics."
"This Inuktitut panel, about language as human right, appeared to symbolize that evolution."
"Kotierk’s speaking notes, which can be found here, outline numerous laws that ought to promote and protect Inuktut in Nunavut where the majority population is Inuit and the majority language spoken is Inuktut."
"Those laws range from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to the calls to action and justice from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, and territorial language laws in Nunavut."
"Kotierk listed several recent examples where Inuit deaths were attributed, at least in part, to language and culture barriers, such as that of Annie Kootoo, who died of acute liver failure in 2017, and 15-year-old Ileen Kooneeliusie, who died from tuberculosis that same year."
“Inuit want to live with dignity and have the human right to do so.
"Inuit Canadians should not be dying because they are unable to access and receive essential services on an equitable basis with other Canadians,” Kotierk wrote in her speaking notes."
"In his speaking notes, Tapardjuk described a recent incident in Iqaluit where RCMP officers visited an elder to tell her that her adopted son had been stabbed to death at a young offenders facility."
The woman was alone and did not speak English.
Tapardjuk said police officers had to stop a vehicle and ask someone to help them deliver the traumatic news.
"“There are a number of protocols in that scenario that should be followed in terms of does the person have support when you’re coming with life-altering information, let alone an interpreter,” Kotierk told Nunatsiaq News."
“So many of us Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are often called to do this.
"We are expected to interpret in any given situation, even if we don’t know the people."
Sometimes it’s confidential information.
"So that, I would say, is another breach of human rights.”"
"Kotierk said at the very least, Inuktut-speakers in Nunavut should have access to frontline service in their language in the areas of health care, justice and education."
But even those aren’t guaranteed.
She and other leaders continue to call on the federal government to protect language and dignity in their homeland.
"Ottawa passed its new Indigenous Languages Act in June to much criticism from NTI and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, who said it ignored most of their suggested amendments."
"Kotierk says she wants Inuit to know, “we are the ones in power."
Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to the store.
Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to the bank.
Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to the school.
"The more we speak Inuktut, and not accommodate other people who cannot understand, the more it will be a given that it needs to be used.”"
QIA announces fees for tourism operators accessing Inuit-owned land
Fees come into effect immediately
"Tourism operators visiting the Qikiqtani region of Nunavut will now be charged tourism fees to access Inuit-owned land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced during its annual general meeting held in Iqaluit on Oct. 8-10."
"Commercial tourism operators now have to pay fees to access Inuit-owned land in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced during its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, Oct. 9."
The Qikiqtani region receives the most cruise ship visits of any region in Nunavut.
"Pond Inlet received 17 cruise ships this year, while Iqaluit received four."
"“Inuit in Qikiqtani communities have expressed concern regarding the increased amount of commercial tourism activities in the region, particularly cruise ships."
"QIA put in place these tourism operation fees to generate direct benefits for Inuit in communities impacted by tourism,” P.J. Akeeagok, QIA’s president, said in a news release."
The announcement was followed by a presentation from QIA’s department of lands and resources on the new fees.
The new fees include the following:
• Plane landing on Inuit-owned land: $150 per landing
• Helicopter landing on Inuit-owned land: $100 per landing
• Commercial guest access for camping on Inuit-owned land: $50 per day
• Commercial guest access for less than six hours on Inuit-owned land: $25 per day
"Half of the fees collected will go to the hunters and trappers organization of the community adjacent to the Inuit-owned land being accessed by tourism operators, the release said."
The other half will go to the QIA.
"Cruise ships visiting Nunavut typically carry anywhere from 150 to 400 people, Rosanne D’Orazio, the QIA’s director of lands and resources, told the QIA’s board members during the meeting."
The $25 per day fee applies to every passenger on a cruise ship accessing Inuit-owned land—or IOL.
"“Regardless of how many people get off that ship and touch IOL, they get charged by the amount of people on the ship,” D’Orazio told the board."
D’Orazio said cruise ships sailing in the Qikiqtani region will typically send the QIA the exact number of passengers on board a month or so before sailing.
"“So if that ship has 350 passengers on it, we charge $25 per day per person."
"So some of the larger cruise ships easily come up to a $10,000 to $20,000 fee just to land on IOL,” D’Orazio said."
"For communities that receive a lot of cruise ships in the summer, like Pond Inlet, their HTO could receive $50,000 to $70,000 in fee payments, she added."
The new fees will also be put up on the QIA’s land use application online registry.
"That way, tour operators would be given notice of the new fees when they apply to access Inuit-owned land."
D’Orazio said the QIA set the fees based on what other organizations were charging for tourism.
"For example, Parks Canada charges $25 per day per person to enter a national park."
"Hamlets will also often charge cruise ships and tourism operators when they enter communities, D’Orazio added."
"“The cruise ships that access IOL are paying this fee only when they actually go into IOL parcel itself,” she said."
"Joe Attagutaluk, the QIA’s secretary-treasurer, asked if it was possible that the fees would be increased in the future."
"D’Orazio said changes would be possible, but would have to be discussed and decided on by the QIA’s board."
“It’s an exciting initiative.
"We’re leading again as an example of Inuit bringing back the benefits to the community,” Akeeagok told board members."
"The fees take effect immediately, the QIA said."
Baffinland’s massive railway-based sealift raises concerns in Pond Inlet
“Is Baffinland assuming that behind our backs NIRB or government has pre-approved the project?”
"The cargo vessel Biglift Barentsz docked at Bremerhaven, Germany, last summer."
"On top of the deck you can see two prefabricated buildings, 33 and 34 metres high, that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. acquired from ThyssenKrupp and shipped to the Mary River mine site this summer."

Community leaders in Pond Inlet are unhappy about a massive sealift of railway materials that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. transported to its Mary River iron mine site this summer.
"They’re concerned because, to get an early start on its big railway-based phase two expansion plan, which regulators have not yet approved, Baffinland sent two huge 10-storey pre-fabricated buildings from Bremerhaven, Germany, to the company’s port at Milne Inlet on north Baffin Island this summer."
"They also shipped two smaller prefab buildings and large amounts of railway-construction materials, such as tracks and spikes."
"Baffinland, as early as November 2018, told regulators and its partners at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association about the shipments, through written documents buried inside the public registries of the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."
But people in Pond Inlet are only finding out about it now.
"The Biglift Barentsz approaches Baffinland’s port at Milne Inlet this past August, carrying big prefabricated buildings for use in the company’s railway-based expansion."
"When people in Pond Inlet saw the vessel pass by their community, it was the first they had heard of the shipment. Two more vessels carrying railway-based material arrived later, and more shipments are to arrive in the summer of 2020. ((Photo courtesy of ThyssenKrupp)"
“We’ve just been finding out over the past three or four weeks.
"We see these things [ships] passing by Pond Inlet being shipped up,” Joshua Arreak, manager of the Mittimatalik hunters and trappers organization, told Nunatsiaq News"
“We wondered why and who and how they were doing that.
"There is no explanation whatsoever from NIRB [Nunavut Impact Review Board], QIA [Qikiqtani Inuit Association] or anyone."
"We were caught by surprise by this,” Arreak said."
“We have not heard from QIA or NIRB.
I don’t know.
It’s within the Inuit organizations that we are having problems.
"They are not communicating with us,” he said."
NIRB acknowledged sealift earlier this year
"No Nunavut regulator and no federal government minister has said yes to Baffinland’s phase two expansion plan, which would see a 110-kilometre railway between Milne Inlet and Mary River, a doubling of ore production to 12 million tonnes a year, and nearly 200 voyages annually by huge ore-carrying vessels."
The project can’t be formally approved by the federal government until after a final public hearing before the NIRB that’s set to start this Nov. 2 in Iqaluit and finish up Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 in Pond Inlet.
"The NIRB, which did not seek comment on the issue from stakeholders, acknowledged the early sealift of railway materials in a letter sent to Baffinland this past July 25."
"The NIRB warned the company that if its phase two plan is not approved, it would be up to Baffinland to remove the materials, likely worth many millions of dollars, from the site."
They also said the sealift will not affect NIRB’s decision-making on the file.
"In an email sent Oct. 17, NIRB’s executive director, Ryan Barry, clarified that there is no legal mechanism for NIRB to either approve or prevent the sealift activity."
"“The NIRB was left to instead point out that these activities would continue to be included in the ongoing assessment and all related materials could be subject to removal if the proposal is not approved to proceed at the conclusion of the Board’s assessment,” Barry wrote."

"One of the structures, described as a “crusher building,” is 33 metres high, 23.5 metres wide and weighs 1,470 tonnes."
"Another one, described as a “screen building,” is 34 metres high."
"That makes each building, part of a prefabricated crushing and screening plant, roughly equal in height to a 10-storey apartment building—likely higher than any other enclosed structure in the eastern Arctic."
But Baffinland does not yet have permission to use them.
"“Baffinland will clearly mark the equipment as ‘Phase 2 only—Do Not Use’ until such a time that the Phase 2 Proposal reconsideration process has been finalized,” the company wrote last July 19 in a report to the NIRB."
Materials stored on Inuit-owned land
"In joint submissions to regulators, QIA and Baffinland say the materials would be stored on Inuit-owned land, subject to the terms of QIA’s commercial lease agreement with the company."
"For Arreak and others, the process so far suggests Baffinland may believe approval of the project is already a done deal."
“Pond Inlet people are not happy.
Is Baffinland assuming that behind our backs NIRB or government has pre-approved the project?
"I don’t know,” he said."
"Frank Tester, a technical advisor to the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, received permission from the mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Katsak, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the hamlet."
"“Baffinland does indeed seem to have acted on the assumption that they would get approval for Phase 2,” Tester said in an emailed statement."
"“Whether NIRB had any powers with regard to this matter, the net effect is to give the impression that it puts pressure on NIRB with respect to its responsibilities and saying ‘yes’ to the proposal."
"This is of concern,” Tester said on behalf of the hamlet."
"“Technicalities aside, the hamlet is of the opinion that this should not have happened."
"This was clearly driven purely by financial considerations and assumptions made by Baffinland about approval for Phase 2,” he wrote."
"“Our main concern is animals, the mammals and the marine environment."
We would be the most affected community.
That’s our concern.
"Money won’t bring back the animals,” Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the hunters and trappers, stating an oft-repeated message that Pond Inlet has made for years in response to the marine transport component of Baffinland’s plan."
"As for the non-governmental organization Oceans North, an intervenor at the upcoming public hearing on Baffinland’s expansion plan, they say they support “responsible development” of the Mary River mine."
"But they also say Baffinland may be shipping too much ore too fast without a full appreciation of its environmental impact, and they’re critical of Baffinland’s decision to ship large quantities of ore out of Milne Inlet rather than Steensby Inlet to the south, which they were permitted to do back in 2012."
"“I am not surprised that community members are upset that large shipments of rail equipment have arrived at Milne Inlet in advance of regulatory approval for this expansion,” said Chris Debicki, the vice president of policy development and counsel for Oceans North."
Prefab system acquired from ThyssenKrupp
These materials that are being shipped to Milne Inlet are part of a prefabricated railway-based material handling system that Baffinland acquired from the ThyssenKrupp conglomerate in Germany.
"The two big buildings, which arrived first, were assembled in Bremerhaven, while a third structure, a rail-car unloading station, was assembled in Stettin, Poland, ThyssenKrupp said in a news release."
"Baffinland has also transported a ship loader, a conveyor belt system and numerous other materials for use in a railway transportation system."
"The list of materials that Baffinland filed with the NIRB and the NWB includes railway ties, bundles of rails, along with track spikes and tie plates."
"ThyssenKrupp’s first shipment for Baffinland, on a vessel called the BigLift Barentsz, amounted to 5,500 tonnes of material, departing from Bremerhaven in early August."
"Two more cargo ships delivered more materials this past summer, with more to follow in the summer of 2020, ThyssenKrupp said."
"In a deal with QIA, Baffinland has agreed to put an extra $18 million into a reclamation security fund set aside to clean up the Mary River site if and when the project ends, NWB documents state."
Nunavut’s legislative assembly names new acting languages commissioner
Karliin Aariak’s appointment becomes effective Oct. 21
"Nunavut’s legislative assembly has appointed an acting languages commissioner, Karliin Aariak, following the resignation of Helen Klengenberg, who resigned from office in September."
Karliin Aariak of Iqaluit has been appointed as Nunavut’s acting languages commissioner.
"Simeon Mikkungwak, Speaker of the legislative assembly, announced the appointment, which is effective Oct. 21, last week."

"“Ms. Aariak’s professional background, which includes positions in both the Office of the Languages Commissioner and the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, makes her well-suited to taking on these important responsibilities,” Mikkungwak said in a news release."
"Under the Official Languages Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act, the languages commissioner has a mandate to protect language rights for the Inuktut, French and English languages."
"The languages commissioner also acts in the role of ombudsperson and monitors, advises and advocates for language rights’ protection."
"Under the Official Languages Act, the languages commissioner of Nunavut is appointed by the commissioner of Nunavut on the recommendation of the legislative assembly for a four-year term."
"The management and services board of the legislative assembly may also recommend the appointment of an acting languages commissioner when the office is vacant and the house is not sitting, the release on Aariak’s appointment said."
"The previous languages commissioner, Helen Klengenberg, resigned from office in September."
"Eva Aariak, Karliin’s mother and a former premier of Nunavut, served as the first languages commissioner for Nunavut before her 2008 election to the Nunavut legislature."
"A public invitation for applications for the position of Nunavut languages commissioner has been issued, the legislative assembly said, with further information about the position on its website."
Montreal women’s shelter announces plans for new emergency night shelter
Inuit women make up about 15 per cent of the current clientele of Chez Doris
"Marina Boulos-Winton, the executive director of Chez Doris, and Cathy Wong, the city councillor for the Peter-McGill district and Speaker of Montreal city council, talk about the plans for a new 22-bed women’s shelter in downtown Montreal on Oct. 16 at a news conference at Chez Doris."

"Montreal’s downtown borough of Ville-Marie has given the green light to an expansion project launched by Chez Doris, a day shelter for homeless women, by granting a zoning change for a building it acquired last year."
"The borough’s decision, announced on Wednesday, Oct. 16, will allow for major renovations to the new building located not far from the current shelter, so it will become a new emergency night shelter for women."
"Chez Doris, the women’s day shelter at 1430 Chomedey St. in Montreal, is open seven days a week to women who need help."
Many are Inuit.
"The shelter’s current building is located on Chomedey St., not far from Atwater St. and Cabot Square, a gathering place for Inuit downtown."
"Chez Doris is familiar to many Inuit women, who make up about 15 per cent of the shelter’s clientele."
"Slated to open in the winter of 2021, the building that will house the new emergency overnight shelter was purchased last year with a $1-million donation from Montreal businessman Andrew Harper through the Jewish Community Foundation of Montreal."
"“Thanks to our new pavilion, we will be able to offer 22 emergency overnight beds for women who are homeless,” said Marina Boulos-Winton, the executive director of Chez Doris, in a news release following an event held at the Chez Doris shelter."
"“Currently, women make up about 25 per cent of the homeless population in Montreal, yet the resources dedicated to women in vulnerable situations are far from sufficient."
This project is certainly a step in the right direction.”
"The good news about the shelter’s expansion came less than a week after a longtime Inuk shelter client, Klara Okkuatsiajuak, originally from Nunatsiavut, passed away on Oct. 11 in hospital."
Boulous-Winton told Nunatsiaq News that Okkuatsiajuak had never recovered from the recent loss of her daughter to suicide while in jail.
"Most of the shelter’s Inuit clients first end up in the city as a result of housing shortages and legal problems, Boulos-Winton said."
Many of them come to sleep in Chez Doris’s six respite beds during the day where they sleep for a few hours and then head back out onto the streets for the night.
That will change with the new night shelter.
"For now, Chez Doris, which receives up to 100 women a day, offers services and programs to provide for women’s basic and immediate needs related to homelessness, poverty, mental illness and addictions."
Boulos-Winton said the numbers of Inuit women using the shelter have remained stable since 2018.
"“However, we have seen a surge in the number of Inuit women needing help with primary needs such as emergency clothing and showers,” she said."
"The only women’s day shelter in Montreal, Chez Doris is now open seven days a week, from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m."
"Dependent on donations for its programs, Chez Doris had to stop offering its weekend service for six months in 2014 due to a lack of money."
"“We hope to receive financial support from Makivik [Corp.], but do not know at this time if we will,” said Boulos-Winton."
"Chez Doris runs an Inuit assistance program—but Chez Doris fundraises to offer this program, as it does for 70 per cent of its roughly $1.7-million annual budget."
"Cathy Wong, the city councillor for the Peter-McGill district and Speaker of Montreal city council, said at the announcement about the new night shelter that it would give women access to “adapted services offered by people who care about their well-being and their safety.”"
Nunavut repudiates the Liberals
"On the questions that matter most, the Liberals had little to offer"
Mumilaaq Qaqqaq’s victory on Oct. 21 represents a repudiation of Liberal policy in Nunavut and the Arctic.
Remember all those Liberal announcements?
Announcement after announcement after announcement.
More than we or any of you can possibly remember.
"And that doesn’t matter, because as most Nunavut voters demonstrated on Oct. 21, they signified nothing."
"From 2015 onwards, Justin Trudeau and other members of the Liberal government have showered Nunavut with announcements."
A few of those announcements even offered things that were new.
"But in the end, the people of Nunavut said “no thanks.”"
"In the end, they turned to the party that, since 1961, Canadians have often turned to when they want to protest the status quo: the New Democrats."
"Young Mumilaaq Qaqqaq’s upset victory represents a rejection of Trudeau’s approach to Arctic and northern Canada, which includes a repudiation of the much-talked-about Inuit-Crown partnership."
"Since 2015, Trudeau has built relationships with the elite office holders at organizations like Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."
"But this week’s election result shows that for ordinary Nunavummiut, the Inuit-Crown partnership is so far mostly irrelevant."
"And that’s not surprising, because, in the end, on the big questions that matter most to Nunavummiut, the Liberals had little to offer."
"It’s well-known that for most people in Nunavut, the top issues are economic and social: the perennial shortage of housing, poverty, the cost of store-bought food and air fares, the prevalence of deadly diseases like tuberculosis, and the everyday reality of suicide."
"But on his last visit to Nunavut, this past Oct. 8, Trudeau brought no convincing messages on those issues."
He used the landscape of south Baffin to talk about climate change and conservation.
"Those are critical issues for all Canadians, but in this election, it’s issues like housing and the cost of living that Nunavut residents wanted answers for."
"Instead, Trudeau turned the picturesque valley of the Sylvia Grinnell River into a vast studio for use in a video shoot aimed, not at Nunavut voters, but at southern Canadians."
"In doing so, he failed to respond to the suffering of Nunavummiut and he badly failed Nunavut’s highly promising Liberal candidate, Megan Pizzo-Lyall, who deserved better support from her party leader."
"On food prices and malnutrition, the Liberals have actually acted, creating a special higher-level subsidy for the Nutrition North Canada program, as well as putting more money, $12.5 million a year, into a fund for Indigenous harvesters in Nunavut and other northern regions."
"But the harvesting money has yet to materialize and no one, so far, has been able to explain why."
"And this past Aug. 1, Trudeau made a big splash in Iqaluit and in Arctic Bay, when he sealed a deal to create the Tallurutiup Imanga marine protected area and promised the creation of a new protected area called Tuvaijuittuq."
"In doing so, he showered millions on the communities of north Baffin, for small harbours and conservation-related jobs."
He also pushed conservation as a way to achieve reconciliation with Indigenous people.
"The problem with that approach is this: when you’re coughing your lungs out with tuberculosis inside a badly overcrowded house, the term “reconciliation” doesn’t mean much."
"Speaking of which, remember the Liberal government’s major announcement about TB?"
"That was early in 2018, when Jane Philpott, then the national health minister, promised to eliminate the disease from Inuit Nunangat by 2030."
"But Philpott, the federal minister who took personal charge of that file and made that promise, is gone."
"Disgusted by Trudeau’s treatment of former justice minister Jody Wilson Raybould and by his unethical interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, Philpott quit cabinet."
"Since then, the Liberals have been mostly silent on the elimination of tuberculosis."
"Like the harvesting fund, it appears to be stuck somewhere inside the Inuit-Crown partnership. This suggests that their bold anti-TB promise is now in jeopardy."
"And as everyone knows, TB is a disease of poverty, related directly to poor nutrition and poor housing."
"But on housing, Trudeau offered only a re-heated re-announcement this past summer."
"And his government’s National Inuit Housing Strategy, “co-developed” with ITK, offers little hope for concrete action."
We extend our congratulations to Mumilaaq Qaqqaq for her impressive victory.
"As a new member of the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons, she’ll need much support to ensure her voice is heard."
Nunavummiut should give her the benefit of the doubt and make sure she gets that support.
"Qaqqaq defeated two highly talented opponents, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."
We hope defeat does not deter either of those two women from offering continued service to Nunavut and the Arctic.
MLAs question ministers on $80M increase to fibre optic line project
“I look at my colleagues here and we have a lot of suggested uses for $80 million”
"Joelie Kaernerk, MLA for Amittuq, was one of the MLAs who stood in Nunavut’s legislative assembly to question the government on an $80-million increase to the Iqaluit-Nuuk fibre optic project."
Some Nunavut legislators are questioning what they feel is an unjustified increase in funding to the territory’s Nuuk-Iqaluit fibre optic project.
"In August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, which involves 1,700 kilometres of fibre optic cable running from Nuuk, Greenland, across the Davis Strait to Iqaluit."
"From there, a branch will extend to Kimmirut."
"The Government of Nunavut will design and execute the project, set to be complete by 2023."
"Last year, MLAs approved the project, which was originally supposed to cost $126 million."
"“After this year passed, we received notification that the project cost jumped commensurate to increased costs and now is estimated at $209 million,” John Main, MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in his member’s statement on Wednesday, Oct. 23."
"That’s an $80-million difference, Main said."
"“I look at my colleagues here and we have a lot of suggested uses for $80 million,” Main said."
The federal funds come from the rural and northern communities infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada Plan.
The project is also currently before the legislature’s committee of the whole as it reviews capital expenses for 2020-21.
"Later that day during question period, Joelie Kaernerk, MLA for Amittuq, asked Lorne Kusugak, minister of community and government services, if the $80-million increase had gone through the government’s preplanning process."
"That process, as defined in the GN’s capital planning process handbook, “is intended to ensure that the program is clearly defined, and that enough information is available to develop appropriate scope, a reliable cost estimate and schedule, prior to proceeding further in the capital planning process.”"
"“Did it go through the preplanning stages, yes or no?”"
Kaernerk asked Kusugak.
“The planning has been done and trying to come up to a definitive figure as to how much it would cost.
"Once we got more information, we found out that it would be much more expensive,” Kusugak replied."
"Main, who sits next to Kaernerk in the assembly, rose next to continue questioning Kusugak."
“Can the minister explain how a project of this magnitude can see such a huge cost increase in the space of one year?”
"Kusugak repeated that after the money requested for the project was approved last year, the department reviewed the project and the cost increased after that review."
"Kusugak added that in May 2019, his department determined that the funding request to the federal government should be increased to $201.6 million “in order to ensure that maximum available federal funding contribution was available for this initiative if required.”"
"The next day, on Oct. 24, Main rose again during question period to press Finance Minister George Hickes on the same point."
"“In terms of the financial management board, what specific processes and actions took place following that notification from the department that there was an $80-million cost increase to this ongoing capital project?”"
Main asked.
"Hickes said because the federal government increased its contributions to the project, along with a fully funded marine survey of the proposed project area, the GN increased its funding too."
“The Department of Community and Government Services brought it back to [the financial management board] with the recognition that the cost estimates were under-estimated.”
"Hickes also pointed out that the GN contributes one-quarter of the money for the project, while the federal government contributes the other 75 per cent."
"“As the GN, we’re not on the hook for $80 million, we’re on the hook for 25 per cent of that."
"So we will be looking at sometime down the road in future fiscal years, be looking at additional funds to complete out this project,” he added."
"Nunavik needs its own riding, says Makivik president"
Charlie Watt responds to federal election with optimism and a call for change
"Charlie Watt, president of Makivik Corp., released a statement on Oct. 22 following the federal election, calling for Nunavik to have its own federal riding."
By Elaine Anselmi
"Makivik Corp. president Charlie Watt didn’t mince his words about Nunavik’s political landscape when he sent his congratulations to the region’s new MP, Sylvie Bérubé."
"“We intend to follow up with the electoral boundaries commission to make the point, once again, that a Nunavik riding be created that reflects our region for Inuit, now more so considering the self-determination project we are working on,” he said."
“We need this at the provincial level as well.”
"Abitibi–James Bay–Nunavik–Eeyou is the largest federal riding in Quebec, extending from Nunavik south to the La Vallée-de-l’Or regional county municipality, where four of the six 2019 federal candidates reside, including Bérubé of the Bloc Québécois."
Nunavik leaders have lobbied for a riding of their own since 1972.
"In 2002, the Kativik Regional Government along with Makivik went before the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission on the issue and again in 2011."
"Since then, the boundaries of the riding were increased in 2013, adding two more southern communities."
"Boundaries are redrawn, according to the commission, so that each contains roughly the same number of people."
"Across Quebec, they average around 100,000 people per riding, with Abitibi–James Bay–Nunavik–Eeyou on the lower end with about 85,000 people."
"With a population of about 13,000, Nunavik is well below this, but their leaders have argued for an exception due to the region’s ethnic makeup."
"The smallest federal riding in Canada is Labrador, with about 26,000 people, while the Newfoundland ridings hover around 80,000 people."
"Bérubé won the northern Quebec riding with more than 11,000 votes, or nearly 40 per cent, followed by the Liberal and Conservative party candidates."
"Watt congratulated Green Party candidate Kiara Cabana-Whiteley, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, who came in fifth with just over 1,000 votes."
"In his statement, Watt invited Bérubé to visit the Nunavik region at her earliest opportunity."
"“I look forward to meeting with her, and receiving her support for our work on self-determination, and on issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,” Watt said."
"He had a firm message for Bloq Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, whose separatist party won 32 seats across Quebec."
"“We hope you are supportive of our development projects in Nunavik—both political and economic—and on that political terrain we can develop positive relations,” said Watt."
"“However, on the issue of Quebec sovereignty, Inuit have a solid history of supporting a united Canada.”"
"Watt framed the election, which gave the Liberals a minority government, as an opportunity to bring the different parties and parts of the country together."
"“Justin Trudeau has a strong minority government, and he can work with the other parties—the NDP, the Bloc Quebecois, Greens, the Conservatives, and the Independent candidate—to pass bills and present them to the House, and in the process build national unity,” he said."
"For Nunavut’s new NDP MP, Mumilaaq Qaqqaq of Baker Lake, he had hopeful words."
"“I remember the [Inuit Tapirisat of Canada] meeting in Baker Lake in 1971 with Tagak Curley,” Watt said."
“We were all young back then.
"You’ll do well Mumilaaq, and I look forward to meeting you and working on Inuit self-determination together, for the next generation.”"
"Expand use of anti-RSV agent in Nunavut, thousands of petitioners say"
"“For the Inuit, you save money because of the high rate of RSV”"
A Nunavut Lifeline air ambulance parked at the Iqaluit airport during a summer air show.
"In some years, infant medevacs caused by RSV outbreaks can generate huge medevac and hospitalization costs."
"When Dr. Anna Banerji and her fellow alumni from the University of Toronto medical school class of 1989 first posted their petition on change.org at the end of September, they hoped to attract 1,000 signatures."
"But at the time this article was written, they had gathered 23,322 names—and they now hope to reach 25,000."
Their petition says the Government of Nunavut could prevent multiple needless deaths and admissions to hospital of infants by extending the use of an antibody called palivizumab to all babies under the age of six months.
"Palivizumab is an immunization agent, though not a vaccine, and is marketed under the brand name Synagis."
"It’s been proven effective in preventing lower lung infections in infants caused by RSV, short for “respiratory syncytial virus,” which attacks the lower part of the lung, causing a frightening disease called bronchiolitis."
"But Dr. Michael Patterson, the chief medical officer of health in Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the GN only gives palivizumab to about 11 to 12 per cent of all children younger than two years of age."
"“We do it selectively, for children that are at the greatest risk of severe complications from RSV, and groups where there is demonstrated real-world benefit in giving them palivizumab,” he said."
"That includes children born prematurely, at fewer than 35 weeks’ gestation, or children with chronic lung or heart disease."
"Banerji, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, has published multiple studies over the past decade and a half on the prevalence and cost of RSV in the Arctic."
"And, based on that research, she disagrees strongly with Nunavut’s current policy and says all Nunavut infants should get the antibody."
"Dr. Anna Banerji, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, says her research demonstrates that immunizing all Inuit infants with an antibody called palivizumab would save lives and money."
Nunavut’s staggering costs make it worthwhile
She said her studies have shown the prevalence of RSV in Nunavut can reach staggering levels and produce staggering medevac and hospitalization costs for Nunavut’s Department of Health.
"The antibody is expensive: about $5,600 per dose."
"But even at that price, Banerji and many others believe it’s a bargain."
"That’s because Nunavut’s high infection rates and high emergency evacuation costs make it economical to use, they argue."
"“We did several cost analyses that shows that in most parts of the Arctic that if you give palivizumab, it saves money,” she said in an interview."
"One cost analysis, published in 2013, found a big rate of lower respiratory tract infection in Kitikmeot babies: calculated at 389 per 1,000."
"During that study period, which ran from Jan. 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, the average cost of admission to hospital per infection ran to $57,535."
"For the Qikiqtani region, lung infections in infants occurred at a rate of 202 per 1,000 live births and in the Kivalliq region, at a rate of 230 per 1,000 live births."
This meant the GN spent about $5.9 million to care for gravely ill Qikiqtani infants and about $5.7 million for sick Kivalliq infants during the study period.
"The Kivalliq region racked up the highest average cost per lower respiratory tract infection admission: $63,686."
"“For the Inuit, you save money, because of the high rate of RSV,” she said."
Head of Ontario physicians group supports petition
"The president of the Ontario Medical Association, Dr. Sohail Gandhi, endorses Banerji’s position. “Inuit infants have 10 times the rates of admission with RSV than the “high-risk” infants and the symptoms are often more severe."
"Despite this disparity, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not get the antibody,” Gandhi wrote in his endorsement."
"That position is also endorsed by professionals at the Northern School of Medicine, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Institutes of Health Reseach Institute of Indigenous Peoples’ Health."
But healthy babies in Nunavut whose mothers carry them to full term don’t get the antibody—even if they’re from high-risk communities outside Iqaluit with historically high levels of RSV infection.
Banerji says that’s the wrong approach.
“I’ve done my due diligence.
I’ve shown my data to everyone.
"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Philpott, they’ve seen the data and they say yeah, it’s really convincing,” she said."
Nunavik immunizes all babies
"And she points out that, unlike Nunavut, health authorities in Nunavik have given palivizumab to all infants for about three years now."
"In the Nunavut legislature on Oct. 18, Health Minister George Hickes said, in response to questions from Iqaluit-Niaqunngu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the GN is taking a close look at the Nunavik example."
"“We are following the progress of that program,” he said."
Angnakak said that RSV can have a devastating impact on families.
"“Recently, somebody who I know had their baby medevaced because of RSV and it really has an impact on the family, especially when the baby is so young."
But Hickes defended the GN’s current approach and denied that his government is trying to save money by restricting the antibody to only pre-term babies.
“It’s not a political or a policy decision based on cost.
"It’s following best medical practices,” Hickes said."
Patterson acknowledged that Nunavik went ahead three years ago with blanket immunizations of all infants under six months.
"“We are waiting for some analyses on those numbers, and if we can find demonstration that there’s significant cost savings to administering palivizumab, we would probably adopt it as quickly as we could,” Patterson said."
"But he said that in his opinion, there isn’t enough evidence to justify extending its use in Nunavut."
"“There’s a couple of things that I disagree with in the petition and one of them is the presentation that this is a done deal, or that there’s a scientific consensus on this issue."
"There are still a lot of people with questions,” he said."
The controversy over the use of palivizumab in Nunavut dates back many years.
"In 2008, the GN refused to even participate in one of Banerji’s studies on RSV, even though officials in Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories agreed to participate in it."
Model tiny home arrives in Kuujjuaq
Nunavik Building offers a small housing solution

The first of a series of tiny homes developed for Nunavik arrived on the sealift in Kuujjuaq this summer.
"“I wanted to show people what kind of quality of house we are building for the North,” said Willie Gadbois, co-founder of Nunavik Building, a home designer and developer with offices in Kuujjuaq and Napierville, Quebec."
"About a decade ago, Gadbois, a Kuujjuaq-based plumber, furnace repairman and housebuilder, met building expert Claude Jannelle."
"“We started talking about affordable housing in the North,” Gadbois said."
“Housing in the North is so expensive.
That’s where it started.”
"From that, they’ve developed designs for tiny homes that take the northern elements into consideration."
The houses have metal siding and roofing to withstand high winds and last longer than other commonly used materials.
"They’re built with foam insulation injected into the floors, roof and ceiling and with triple-pane windows to keep warmth in."
"They also use radiant floor heating, rather than wall-mounted radiators, to evenly distribute the heat."
"“I think that’s the way to go in the North,” Gadbois said."
“There are all of these problems in the North with heating and heat not being distributed right.
Half the time people say their feet are freezing.
The house is well-insulated but their feet are cold.”

"Having worked in heating and plumbing across Nunavik, Gadbois takes personal care in seeing the units constructed to specifications, ensuring everything is installed properly and easy to maintain."
"Nunavik Building has a range of designs for tiny homes, up to four bedrooms, where separate compartments of the house are attached together."
"And they can be added on to with additional bedrooms and space if, for example, the family grows."
"The house on show in Kuujjuaq is a one-bedroom unit, at just under 5 metres wide and 10 metres long."
"You enter at the end of the building, into the open-concept kitchen and living room."
The bedroom sits just back of that and behind it is the bathroom.
The mechanical room for the house is a separate building just behind it.
It took about two hours to get the finished house in place and hooked up to power and plumbing.
"This model retails for $228,000, hooked up and everything in, said Gadbois."
"By comparison, a typical house in Nunavik would run between $500,000 and $600,000, he said."
"“We’re trying to build affordable houses that are comfortable and don’t have problems with infiltration of water,” said Gadbois."
"“I’ve been a plumber, furnace-man for so many years and so many things are not built right, the plumbing is not right, the heating systems are not right."
I’ve worked on this for many years and we’ve finally got something that’s more adaptable to the North.”
"The houses are constructed in Sherbrooke, Quebec, which takes about a month, Gadbois said, and then trucked and shipped up on the sealift."
"So once orders are in, as long as there’s enough time to book space on the sealift, the house can be in place the following summer."
"“In the future, if everything goes good, we’re talking about building a factory in the North,” he said."
“But that takes a lot of money.”
He added that the homes are a fit across the North and they’d be happy to see orders come in from Nunavut or even Greenland.
"“We’re open and ready to give quotations and ready to build houses,” said Gadbois."
“We’re ready to help people out that need houses.”
"Across Arctic Canada, sea ice levels are again at record lows"
“We could be up to a month behind where we should be at this time of year”
"“Freeze-up is very, very late this year,” says Gjoa Haven’s Willie Aglukkaq, who took this photo on Oct. 18."
"“Can still drive boats to mainland, which is very unusual for Gjoa Haven."
Never seen the ocean open this late in my lifetime.”

"Last October, when Juuta Sarpinak of Igloolik set off on a seal hunt, he took his snowmobile."
"For the same trip exactly a year later, he’d need a boat."
"Across Nunavut and the rest of the Arctic, the same scenario is playing out."
"“It’s the latest I’ve ever seen it freeze up in my lifetime,” said Willie Aglukkaq, who’s lived in Gjoa Haven for nearly 40 years."
He’s right.
"As of Oct. 15, sea ice levels hit 5.118 million square kilometres, making them the lowest on record, which began in 1968."
"“Depending on the area, we could be up to a month behind where we should be at this time of year,” said Gilles Langis, senior ice forecaster with the meteorological service of Canada."
But it’s not the first time this year ice levels have been at record lows.
April also saw the least amount of sea ice ever recorded.
This was then followed by a record-setting July.
"In August, the ice loss slowed."
"“We were tied for the second-lowest [amount of ice] with 2007 and 2016, but quite a bit above 2012,” said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center."
"“But now we’re actually below 2012 levels for this time of year because it’s a slow freeze-up—2012 recovered pretty quickly, but we’ve been very sluggish in growing ice this year.”"
"As of Oct. 15, sea ice levels dropped below those from 2012, which previously held the record."

"With sea ice growth, the big driver is air temperature."
"“If you have an area of open water and the temperatures above it are cooler than the water temperature, it’ll lose heat into the atmosphere and the water will start cooling off to the point where it reaches freezing,” said Langis."
"But Arctic air temperatures through October have been unseasonably warm, much like the previous six months."
"“It was a pretty extreme summer,” said Meier."
"From April onward, every month has ranked in the top three warmest—in terms of Arctic air temperature—on record, with May and August now holding top spots."

What’s going on this year is representative of something larger.
"“Under the influence of global heating caused by human-induced greenhouse gases emissions, we have seen a sharp decrease in the extent of Arctic sea [ice] since 1979,” says Pascal Peduzzi, Director of GRID-Geneva, in a press release published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)."
"Much like the scenario currently playing out across the Arctic this year, declining sea ice has amplified Arctic warming over the last several decades."
"According to the press release, “Temperatures increased by around 0.5°C per decade between 1982 and 2017, primarily due to increased absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss since 1979."
This is twice as fast as the global average.”
This season isn’t an exception.
"But while the year-to-year trend continues on, ice coverage this year is on the rebound."
"“It’s just finally starting to freeze,” said Aglukkaq."
"Over the last 10 days, since Oct. 20, sea ice coverage has increased by almost 1.5 million square kilometres, including the water near Gjoa Haven."
"If the current pace of ice growth continues, 2019 may soon once again be above 2012 levels."
Iqaluit welcomes new fire chief
"“For me, it’s an exciting opportunity”"
Gord Howard has been Iqaluit’s new fire chief for only about two weeks.
"He’s spent most of that time reading and learning as much as he can, but he says his new position offers him an opportunity he relishes."
(Photo by Dustin Patar)
"When Gordon Howard appeared before Iqaluit city council for the first time on Oct. 22 as the city’s newly hired fire chief, he didn’t expect one question that was thrown at him."
“I’m very much hoping that you are a Montreal Canadiens fan?”
asked Coun. Joanasie Akumalik.
"After several long moments of silence, Howard shook his head and responded, “Nope.”"
The room broke into laughter.
"A week later, during an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Howard admitted, “I felt at that point that maybe I should just keep my team to myself.”"
"Howard, who originally grew up in Hamilton, came to Iqaluit by way of Meaford, Ontario, a small town near Collingwood on Georgian Bay."
"While it’s his first time here, he’s not a complete stranger to the North."
"During a decade-long career as an emergency medical technician with the Canadian Forces, he’s spent time near Arviat living in a tent during the height of winter."
"“So I understand snow, I understand cold, but that offers its own unique challenges."
"You know, it’s a different world up here and I think that that was kind of the draw for me to come up here."
"It’s an interesting department,” said Howard, referring to the fact that the Iqaluit fire department is a composite department—one that’s made up of career firefighters and volunteers."
That wasn’t all that drew Howard to Iqaluit.
In addition to the position utilizing his background in both firefighting and EMS—a rarity in most other departments—the other big draw was the prevalence of fires in Iqaluit.
"“The statistics for this department are staggering,” said Howard."
"“This is a busy, busy place and they’ve stayed afloat with what they have.”"
"The challenges facing the department, and now Howard, are nuanced, from the recurring water issues and a need for more volunteers, to problems with arson and a fire station the department has outgrown."
“It’s not going to be something that we change overnight and I don’t think anybody really wants to change anything overnight.
"As long as we’re moving forward and we’re not taking any steps backwards, I’ll be happy,” said Howard."
"“For me, it’s an exciting opportunity."
"It’s exciting, all the things we’re trying to do and then building off what we already do really well.”"
"Going back to the first question he was asked as the city-appointed director of emergency services, “I’m a Toronto fan,” said Howard with a smile."
“Luckily some guys in the department are Toronto fans.
"I brought a flag, so we can hang it off the truck when they win the Stanley Cup in 20-30 years from now.”"
Bedbug sightings raise alarm among Nunavik patients in Montreal
Hotel manager says repeated inspections by exterminators failed to find the critters
This is the hungry critter you don’t want to find in your room: a bedbug.
But recently bedbugs have been reported in a Dorval hotel where patients from Nunavik stay when receiving health care in the city.
Bedbug sightings in places where Nunavik residents stay while receiving health care in Montreal have caused a lot of anxiety among patients and their families.
This photo shows the bedbug that Cecilia Kutchaka saw last month on a bedsheet while in her mother’s room at the Quality Hotel on Cote de Liesse in Dorval.

"In mid-October Cecilia Kutchaka was visiting her mother at the Quality Hotel on Cote de Liesse in Dorval when she got a fright: under the bed cover she said she found a bedbug, of which she took a photo."
"Kutchaka then reported that she had seen a bedbug to the onsite security staffer for patients from Nunavik’s Ullivik patient residence, which takes a block of rooms, 39 in all, on the hotel’s first floor for its overflow."
Kutchaka then called her mother who told her that she’d never stay there again.
"The hotel’s general manager, Nader Abdel Nour, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he’s perplexed about some of the bedbug sightings."
"That’s because recent, repeated inspections, for which he provided reports from exterminators, haven’t turned up any."
"One inspection of a room showed that there could have been bedbugs there at one point, but they were no longer in the room."
Abdel Nour also shared emails citing complaints from patients who said they had seen bedbugs.
"Because of the importance of Ullivik to his hotel operations, Abdel Nour said they had treated all the rooms earlier this year and continue to conduct routine inspections and treatments, if necessary."
Nunatsiaq News was unable to get a statement from the Nunavik Regional Board of Health or the Module du Nord québécois that deals with Nunavik patients in Montreal about the bedbug sightings and how they deal with these situations.
But the MNQ has spoken about its concerns in an email to Adbel Nour.
"“It appears that the client-residents at the hotel are verbalizing a bedbug problem and are refusing to stay at the hotel,” wrote George Delatolla, the head of lodging at Ullivik, on Oct. 16."
“Please advise me of what and how and when this problem will be resolved.
We need to assure arriving residents that the bedbug issue has been looked into and taken care of.”
Ullivik reportedly treats patients’ bags before they enter the residence.
That there are bedbugs in Montreal is undeniable: a bug infestation closed government offices at the huge Complexe Guy-Favreau last month.
"And if there are bedbugs afoot where there are patients from the North, it would not be the first time, as was the case in 2010 in Winnipeg."
"Bedbugs are not welcome company: they may be small, but they can cause itchy red welts, blisters and rashes where they bite into the skin."
The insect uses one hollow feeding tube to inject saliva that makes the victim’s blood thinner and numbs the skin.
"With another tube, the bedbug sucks out blood, usually for about five minutes."
"After feeding, they turn dark red and bloated. Bedbugs only need to eat every five to 10 days and they can live for up to a year, lurking in the folds of mattresses, bed sheets and other warm, dark places, only surfacing occasionally to feed."
"The good news is that bedbugs don’t like low temperatures, which cause them to go into hibernation and die."
So you can kill them by leaving your bags outside for two or more days if the temperature remains below zero.
"To guard against bedbugs when you’re travelling, inspect the headboard of the bed, look at the mattress and don’t leave your bag on the bed."
"And, when you get home, wash your clothes before bringing them into your bedroom and make sure no bedbugs travelled back with you in your bag."
"If you see bedbugs in Montreal at a hotel, you can call 311 to file a complaint with the city."
"Baffinland hearing abruptly ends, with sessions cancelled in Pond Inlet"
“Inuit have to be part of the process.
"It affects every part of Inuit lives,” says NTI president"
"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet listen as Aluki Kotierk, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.’s president, puts forward a motion to adjourn the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s final public hearing on Baffinland’s phase two expansion on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Iqaluit."

"The Nunavut Impact Review Board hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.’s proposed expansion of its Mary River mine has been abruptly adjourned, with two days of meetings in Pond Inlet now cancelled."
"On Wednesday, Nov. 6, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk brought forward a motion to immediately suspend the final public hearing and defer its continuation for eight months to one year."
"Whispers could be heard throughout the room as intervenors turned to their colleagues. Members of the audience turned their heads, looking for Baffinland’s reaction to what was unfolding."
"Baffinland officials sat stone-faced, sometimes crossing their arms and looking down at the table as Kotierk spelled out the motion."
“We are concerned that we are going to conclude the public hearing when all things haven’t been finished.
The people have to be consulted and have a meaningful discussion.
"Everyone around the table would like to understand everything that is being presented and how it’s going to affect NTI and organizations,” Kotierk said to a room packed with intervenors and the public."
"It affects every part of Inuit lives,” she said."
"The motion was brought forward on the fifth day of the hearing in Iqaluit, an hour before it was scheduled to end."
The NIRB’s original agenda had the hearing continuing to Pond Inlet for community roundtable sessions on Nov. 8 and 9.
"The NIRB ruled in favour of NTI’s motion, suspending the hearing and cancelling the Pond Inlet sessions."
"All week, Baffinland representatives had gone back and forth with intervenors on their planned construction of a rail line north from the Mary River site to its Milne Inlet port."
"The railway, and additional port infrastructure, would make it possible for the company to ramp up their production from the current 6 million tonnes of iron ore per year to 12 million tonnes."
"But one sticking point throughout the week was Baffinland’s request for an amendment to its project certificate that would remove its production cap and replace it with a limit tied to transportation of its product, of 20 train trips per day and 176 ship transits per year."
"The motion to adjourn was supported by all intervenors, many of whom shared similar concerns about uncertainties over the project."
"P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s president, told Nunatsiaq News he had faith in the NIRB’s process to ensure “Inuit would have opportunities to ask good questions in terms of what’s important to them” and “allow community members to really voice their concerns that have been persistent.”"
"Akeeagok said the motion was not pre-conceived, but came together on the final day of the hearing."
Baffinland staff watch as Kotierk introduces the motion to adjourn.
“I think it just boiled down to there’s just too many outstanding questions that haven’t been resolved.
"From my perspective, if you’re going to make a decision for your future, you’ve got to ensure you have all the information available to make that sound decision."
It just wasn’t quite there.”
Representatives from North Baffin communities all agreed with the motion.
"“Further information and assessment is needed,” said Amanda Hanson Main, advisor to the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization."
She said the project “has a serious potential to impact the resources we depend on and maintain our sense of purpose and belonging in the world.”
"Some groups around the table said they do not oppose the Mary River project in general, and they want Baffinland to continue operating in Nunavut, but they have too many questions and concerns with the proposed expansion."
"“The information we’ve been given is watered down and it’s not enough,” said Peter Ivalu, representing the Hamlet of Igloolik."
“All of the information given should be translated.
You have to make sure everything is transparent.”
"The Government of Nunavut agreed with the motion, offering a measured response, saying there has been disagreement between intervenors and the proponent that’s created a standstill."
"The Government of Canada also supported the motion, but said it was up to the NIRB to determine the appropriate length of the delay."
"Through its legal counsel, Baffinland responded that they were opposed to the motion to adjourn for more than eight months and objected that they were given no notice of the motion."
"“All parties to this hearing came to the hearing ready to proceed on November 2 when it started,” said Brad Armstrong, legal counsel for Baffinland."
“Not one party indicated to you that they were not ready to proceed on that date.
There has been nothing in the course of this proceeding that has made anybody less ready than they were when they got here.”
"Megan Lord-Hoyle, vice-president of sustainable development for Baffinland, said delaying the hearing would cause “immediate ramifications” to the business."
"“But we will do everything possible to survive and protect the employment of 3,000 Canadians, 476 of which are Inuit."
We need to know that Inuit will work with us.
"We need some time to determine the ramifications on the business,” Lord-Hoyle said."
"While the QIA has said that it cannot support phase two, Akeeagok said its work to ensure Inuit are informed about the project and that the project is sustainable will not end."
“We’re not opposed to Mary River at all.
We are partners.
We own the Inuit-owned lands that they’re on.
"We support Inuit employment,” he said."
“We invested a lot of our resources and time to ensure the project is sustainable for the long run.
"So with that mindset, we always have to find the balance."
And the balance wasn’t just quite there yet.”
Akeeagok said the communities’ uncertainty around the railway’s impacts on caribou were particularly important to him.
"“As an Inuk, those are things that tie right to your culture."
"And that was very evident with the elders here that they’re not just thinking about themselves, it’s the future generation."
That’s what really hits home to me.
"Any decision I make isn’t about just this moment, it’s the next generation."
Did I leave them something better as a foundation that is much better than what I have now?
"I think that’s the basis of any decision, no matter what culture you’re from,” he said."
"In its ruling, the NIRB gave intervenors until Nov. 15 to file written submissions on the motion. Baffinland will then have until Nov. 22 to respond to those submissions."
"From there, the NIRB will issue written guidance on the motion and the length of the delay."
Nunavut MLAs approve amendments to Income Tax Act
“Our government is taking significant action to recycle carbon revenues back into our economy“
"MLA Adam Lightstone questions Finance Minister George Hickes about Bill 26, the act to amend the Income Tax Act, during the legislative sitting on Wednesday, Nov. 6."
Nunavut MLAs have amended the territory’s Income Tax Act to help take the sting out of carbon pricing.
"The changes, which passed third reading on Wednesday, Nov. 6, include an increase to the basic personal amount from $13,325 to $16,000."
"That means taxpayers will be able to earn almost $3,000 more in a year before having to pay territorial income tax."
"Another change is an increase to the maximum cost of living tax credit from $1,200 to $1,500."
"That means taxpayers who earn more than $60,000 will receive up to an additional $300 back when they file their taxes."
And Nunavut’s corporate tax rate for small businesses has dropped from 4 per cent to 3 per cent.
"“Our government is taking significant action to recycle carbon revenues back into our economy,” said Finance Minister George Hickes."
"On July 1, the federal carbon tax came into effect in Nunavut. To help offset the increase to gas prices—which would have risen by five cents per litre—the territorial government introduced a carbon rebate program, which reduces that fuel price increase by half."
"During debates over the income tax amendments, Nunavut’s MLAs agreed that carbon tax revenues should be returned to the territory’s residents."
But there was disagreement about the best way to do this.
"Adam Lightstone, MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, raised concerns that, with income taxes being cut, the government would come to depend on carbon tax revenues to fund government operations."
“It’s my understanding that we’re currently heavily reliant on federal transfers and our own source revenues make up 10 to 15 percent of what we receive.
"We’re very reliant on those own source revenues that we do generate to meet our operational needs,” said Lightstone."
“Why is it that the government is using carbon tax revenues to fund government operations?”
"“A very small part of the carbon tax revenue that we collect is going to stay with the Government of Nunavut and it’s basically to offset our own carbon,” responded Hickes, who added, “I don’t think the public would be very fond of us if we took these carbon revenues and put them into our general revenue and didn’t pass on any of these savings to the consumer.”"
Lightstone said he didn’t think that amending the Income Tax Act was the most efficient way of giving back to Nunavummiut.
"He also expressed concern that the carbon tax funds being transferred to the territorial government aren’t being used in the way they were intended, to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint."
“Climate change is a matter that I take very seriously and I believe that it is one of the major challenges that are facing this generation as well as the generations to follow.
"With that being said, I have put forward rough ideas and recommendations to this government on numerous occasions about ideas to incentivize or introduce programming to encourage Nunavummiut to adopt energy efficiency initiatives,” said Lightstone."
“Why have those ideas not been taken into consideration and proposed to be used with carbon tax revenues?“
Hickes responded by saying that he’s sure individual departments—who are responsible for specific programs—were listening.
"Some of those departments have already put forward business cases, including the Qulliq Energy Corp., whose program to install energy-efficient LED streetlights across the territory was approved by the MLAs last week."
"In 2019-20, the Government of Nunavut expects to raise over $12 million in carbon taxes."
That will be broken down as follows:
• $2 million will go towards the government’s own higher utility bills to heat public housing and government buildings like schools and health centres.
• $3.6 million for the new Nunavut Carbon Rebate Program.
• $6.2 million will be returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavut businesses this year through the Income Tax Act amendment.
"But for Lightstone, the math didn’t add up."
"“Given the 50 per cent rebate at the pump plus this additional 50 per cent usage of the carbon tax revenues, why is there so little room being left behind for energy efficiency initiatives?”"
"Hickes replied that the federal carbon tax increases each year for the next five years, and while the 50 per cent rebate at the pump program will continue, the annual increase in the tax means more money will be available for additional programs."
The bill passed its second reading during the day of Nov. 6 and received third reading that evening.
"By then, Lightstone, who welcomed a new son into the world the night before and told the legislature he was running on three hours of sleep, had gone home."
"In a later email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightstone said he had planned to vote against the bill."
"“I disagree with the fundamentals of Bill 26, I do not believe it makes for good fiscal policy,” wrote Lightstone in a comment meant to be read to the assembly."
“The purpose of the carbon tax is to reduce consumption of fossil fuel and greenhouse gasses and address climate change.
"Had this bill included specific energy-specific tax rebates for individuals and businesses who wish to invest in energy efficiencies, or if the GN had created an incentive program to assist the public with the purchase and installation of energy initiatives I would have happily voted in favour of this bill.”"
"Despite Lightstone’s objections, the bill passed."
Hickes said he’s open to ideas on how to further use carbon tax revenues to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint.
"“I would strongly encourage members or people out in the public, if they have ideas, to write to their MLA or to the government and bring forward some of these ideas.”"

Government of Nunavut releases annual tourism report for 2018-2019

"From April to Sept. 2018, over 51,000 people visited Nunavut from outside the territory."
"That’s according to Nunavut’s annual tourism report for 2018-2019 from the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, tabled in the legislative assembly earlier this month."
"That same group of people spent a total of $271,383,000 on their travel during that time period, including transportation costs."
The report does not break down specifically how much money was spent on non-transportation costs.
"By comparison, there were an estimated 16,750 non-resident visitors to the territory from May to Oct. 2015, according to that year’s Nunavut visitor exit survey."
The Qikiqtaaluk and Kivalliq regions received the most visitors in Nunavut from July to Sept. 2018.
"The Qikiqtaaluk region had 95,600 visits, with just over half (53.2 per cent) of those visits to Iqaluit with a total of $75.1 million spent."
Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung were the second and third most visited communities in the region.
"In the Kivalliq, Rankin Inlet had 33,600 visits and $68 million in spending, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat."
Cambridge Bay was the dominant community visited in the Kitikmeot.

"Also in 2018, 3,404 cruise tourists visited Nunavut over a two and a half month period."
"Cruise operators spent $388,351 to access community services, according to the report."
But weather and ice conditions affected half of the cruise visits planned for the territory that year.
The department received data from eight cruise operators on 23 voyages that stopped in Nunavut from July to Sept. 2018.
"Those cruise ships carried a total of 3,404 passengers."
"Just over half, or 59 per cent, of the passengers in the sample who disembarked in Nunavut visited Pond Inlet."
"Iqaluit was the second-most visited community for cruise ships with 8.3 per cent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq with 6.1 per cent and Grise Fiord with 5.9 per cent."
"Not only did cruise ship visitors to Pond Inlet spend a total of $246,565, but those visitors also accounted for 100 of the 189.5 hours spent by cruise ship visitors in Nunavut, according to the report."
"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk did not receive any cruise ship visits in 2018."
"According to the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expecting seven visits, which were all cancelled due to weather."
"The report notes that Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were negatively impacted by these cancelled visits, which represents a collective loss of about $25,300."
"Most of the information included in the report comes from the department’s visitor exit survey from 2018, which surveyed cruise ship operators and other visitors to the territory last year."
"In 2018, the GN responded to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about cruise ships going into traditional harvesting areas."
"According to the report, the GN communicated with the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators and all cruise ship operators complied by avoiding these areas."
"It also notes that although tourism is driven by private sector development, it requires government support to flourish."
"In Nunavut’s case, this means training and hiring Nunavummiut to work in tourism."
“Prominent among these challenges is the absence of a suitable labour pool that is interested and trained in different elements of the tourism sector.
"Without a pool of trained, certified employees, opportunities in the tourism industry remain unrealized potential."
"Training has long been a recognized need for the tourism sector in Nunavut,” the report states."
"Nalunaiqsijiit, the Government of Nunavut’s Inuit Cruise Training Initiative, trains 12 Inuit per year to work on board cruise ships as expedition team members, the report states."
"According to the report, all of the GN’s current tourism surveyors are Inuit."
"“Historically, tourism data collection in the territory has been weak, leading to uncertainty regarding the true size of the industry and its contributions to Nunavut’s economy,” the report states."
"The department also funded a total of 115 projects related to tourism in 2018, totalling $1,272,822."
A few of the highlighted projects include:
"• Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum, Voices from Nunavut exhibition: $50,100"
"• Jerry Cans tour: $48,383"
"• Hamlet of Igloolik, Creation of Igloolik Arts: $81,785"
"• Artcirq, Unikkaaqtuat production: $99,872"
"• Nunavut Development Corporation and the Winnipeg Art Gallery’s new store: $225,000 over three years"
"Mary River: if financial viability is a factor, then prove it"
Regulators should demand that Baffinland produce financial evidence
Participants sit inside Iqaluit’s Cadet Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s public hearing on Baffinland Iron MInes Corp.’s railway-based expansion proposal for Mary River.
"Nunavut’s system for regulating industrial development, born within the 1993 Nunavut land claims agreement, has likely never faced a greater test than the twisting, turning series of environmental and socio-economic assessments for the Mary River iron mine over the past 10 years."
"This was on full public display in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s final public hearing on the $900-million railway expansion proposal from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. imploded amidst a mood of confusion and incoherence."
"The final two days of that seven-day hearing, scheduled for Pond Inlet, were cancelled."
"At the same time, the fate of Baffinland’s multibillion dollar, multigenerational iron mine is now shrouded in uncertainty."
"When this editorial was written, the review board had yet to decide on a motion from Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. that, if accepted, would delay proceedings for eight to 12 months."
"And Baffinland’s landlord, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, declared earlier they cannot support or endorse the railway-based expansion."
"But QIA’s business arm, the Qikiqtaaluk Corp., has declared its enthusiastic support for the idea."
So has Arctic Co-operatives Ltd.
This is a complex issue.
"As for Baffinland, its vice-president of sustainable development, Megan Lord-Hoyle, reacted by claiming that the company is now concerned about the project’s very survival, saying, “we will do everything possible to survive and protect the employment of 3,000 Canadians, 476 of which are Inuit.”"
"Just this week, Baffinland confirmed to Nunatsiaq News that it has laid off 490 non-Inuit contract workers and 96 Inuit contract workers."
That leads directly to what has emerged as one of the biggest unanswered questions surrounding the project: Mary River’s financial health.
"Baffinland claims that the mine’s financial viability cannot be guaranteed unless regulators permit them to build a 110-kilometre railway to Milne Inlet and raise production to 12 million tonnes a year, which would require up to 176 voyages through the environmentally sensitive waters of Eclipse Sound."
"The problem is, they’ve put no evidence on the public record to support that claim."
"And until recently, most of the big players weren’t even asking for it."
"But one year ago, that lack of evidence didn’t stop stakeholders from accepting that claim as gospel truth."
"For example, through the summer and fall of 2018, the QIA stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Baffinland, defending it against the Nunavut Impact Review Board."
"On Aug. 31 of that year, the NIRB recommended the federal government say no to an earlier and smaller annual production increase request—from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to six million tonnes."
"So Baffinland and its partner, QIA, swung into action."
"Within weeks, they fired off letters asking that the real decision-maker in such matters, Dominic LeBlanc, then the federal northern affairs minister, reverse the review board’s recommendation."
Why?
Because of money.
"The Inuit organization said they feared for the Mary River mine’s viability, which threatens a long list of cash handouts and other benefits, worth more than $20 million contained in a new Inuit impact and benefit agreement."
Ottawa agreed.
"Heavily influenced by QIA’s fears for the financial viability of the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s request last year."
"“We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and cognizant of QIA’s concern that the economic viability of the project depends on the production increase proposal,” Leblanc wrote on Sept, 30, 2018, in a letter co-signed by Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett."
"In other words, the most important regulator of them all—the federal government—accepts financial viability as a relevant and important factor."
And they did so without having received a shred of financial evidence on that issue.
That’s a big problem.
"Because if it’s true that a project can’t make money, the regulator should be required to call the proponent’s bluff and ask them to prove that claim."
"In just about all other aspects of the Mary River project, Baffinland staff—as they should be—are required to supply mountains of evidence in support of the claims they make in their environmental impact statement."
"But on the project’s financial viability, the NIRB has been reluctant to put any evidence on the public record."
"For example, the review board ruled a lengthy financial document acquired by Oceans North is “irrelevant” and should not be put on the review board’s public registry."
(The document remains on our website.)
NIRB made that ruling even after it had made the document public—and then pulled it away from public view at Baffinland’s behest.
"For its part, Baffinland even offered to submit, in confidence, a much shorter financial summary explaining why Mary River is financially viable only at a greater rate of production."
The request for confidentiality may be a problem.
But at least Baffinland made some effort to clear the air.
"In response, NIRB deferred a decision on the matter, which makes no sense."
"If the federal government can accept financial viability as a factor, then so should the federally funded advisory board."
"Indeed, NIRB and other regulators should do more than just accept such evidence."
They should demand it.
"So should Baffinland’s landlord, QIA."
"And since this kind of issue is likely to come up in other assessments, the federal government should amend the federal law that governs the NIRB’s procedures, the Nunavut Planning and Project Assessment Act, to clarify how such financial information can be handled in the future."
"Yes, as many intervenors have said, there are multiple unanswered questions surrounding Baffinland’s latest expansion proposal, related to the railway’s impact on caribou, the impact of ships on narwhal, the project’s low Inuit employment numbers, and much more."
"More questions surround the status of the Steensby Inlet southbound rail-port proposal, which Baffinland has had permission to build since 2013, with a permitted production rate of 18 million tonnes a year."
It’s still unclear why Baffinland has chosen not to carry out that plan.
But the biggest question of all may be how this project can even survive.
Child-care and family subsidies to increase in Nunavik
Healthy economic growth lets Quebec deliver on commitments earlier than promised
Children and educators are seen at the Aqaivik child-care centre in Kangiqsualujjuaq in 2016.
"That year, the Quebec provincial government put additional contributions by families for child care in place based on family income."
"On Nov. 7, 2019, those contributions were eliminated, bringing the cost of daycare back to a flat rate of $8.25 per day."

By Elaine Anselmi
"An optimistic economic update from Quebec has allowed for more money for families and child-care services across the province, including Nunavik."
"Provincial economic growth was pegged at 2.4 per cent for 2018-19, which is 0.6 per cent more than what was forecast."
"Thanks to this, the province’s finance minister, Eric Girard, announced on Nov. 7 that $857 million will go toward making good on commitments a few years earlier than expected."
Two areas this will go toward are Quebec’s already highly envied child-care subsidies and its family allowance.
"“The Update on Québec’s Economic and Financial Situation shows that Québec is doing very well,” Girard said in a news release."
“The robust economic growth in Québec allows us to reduce the debt burden and to step up the implementation of the government’s commitments.”
"With this funding, the province is eliminating the additional contribution required of families for childcare that was put in place under Philippe Couillard’s provincial Liberal government in 2016."
"Under that program, an additional contribution for child care on top of the flat day rate was geared to income."
That contribution went up to an additional $15 per day for the highest earners.
"Families with an income of less than about $50,000 saw no additional contribution."
"The Nov. 7 announcement will return Quebec’s daycare rate to a flat fee of $8.25, eliminating the additional contribution for all income levels."
"The new rate will apply to Nunavik, under the Kativik Regional Government’s program Nunavik Childcare."
"According to the province’s news release, the new rate will apply this year, and the Montreal Gazette reported it would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2019."
"As of this week, the head of daycare services for the KRG, Julie-Ann Berthe, had not received information on how or when exactly the new rates would be rolled out in Nunavik."
Premier Francois Legault’s government originally pitched a gradual elimination of the additional contribution that would see it fully removed by 2022.
The healthy economy and newfound surplus of $4 billion for 2019-20 are effectively speeding up that process.
"As well as removing the additional cost of childcare, the provincial government is moving ahead with increasing the family allowance that it had promised by 2021."
"As of January 2020, the province says families will on average receive an additional $779 per year."
"This allowance is tied to income, with a minimum allowance of $1,000 and maximum of $2,515 per year."
"The new rules will treat all children the same, rather than the Liberals’ scale of allowances whereby there was a larger allowance for the first child in a family."
"“Today, we are completing the implementation of several measures that will benefit Quebecers,” Girard said."
“We are giving money back to Quebecers more quickly.”
Former Nunavut cabinet minister Peter Kattuk dies following long illness
“Peter was well-respected for his commitment to public service and his environmental advocacy”
"The community flag of Sanikiluaq flies at half-mast in front of the Nunavut legislature on the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 20, in honour of the former MLA and cabinet minister Peter Kattuk, who died that morning after a long illness."
"Sanikiluaq’s community flag is flying at half-mast this morning in front of the Nunavut legislative assembly building in Iqaluit, out of respect for the late Peter Kattuk of Sanikiluaq, who died on the morning of Nov. 20 after a long illness."
"Kattuk, 69, a highly respected MLA, mayor and community leader in his hometown, became part of the territory of Nunavut’s history on Feb. 15, 1999, when voters in the constituency of Hudson Bay chose him to sit in Nunavut’s first legislature, which held its first sitting on April 1 that year."
"The late Peter Kattuk (left) with former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Kattuk was sworn into the Nunavut cabinet."
"During the life of the first legislative assembly, Kattuk became minister of culture, language, elders and youth on April 12, 2000, replacing Kugluktuk MLA Donald Havioyak, who had resigned from the post."
"On Dec. 17, 2001, Kattuk moved from that portfolio to become minister of public works and government services, where he served until 2004."
"Also in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters re-elected him to the Hudson Bay seat, where he sat as a regular MLA until 2008."
"“Peter represented the constituency of Hudson Bay for two terms and I join his family and former constituents in mourning his passing,” Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a statement."
"Born on June 2, 1950, Kattuk served for many years in Sanikiluaq as an environmental activist, mayor and community leader."
"In the early 1990s, he was part of the Sanikiluaq Environment Committee, which gathered local knowledge related to how huge hydroelectric dams constructed in nearby northern Quebec had affected sea ice and marine life around the Belcher Islands."
That led to a well-known report called Voices from the Bay: Traditional Ecological Knowledge of Inuit and Cree in the Hudson Bay Bioregion.
"As mayor of Sanikiluaq, Kattuk also spoke out against the now-defunct Great Whale hydroelectric dam proposal."
"Later on, Kattuk was part of the Nunavut Hudson Bay Inter-Agency Working Group, also called Nunavuummi Tasiujarjuamiuguqatigiit Katutjiqatigiingit."
"That group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, monitored marine conditions around the Belcher Islands in response to a second hydro dam proposal, also put on hold since that time, involving the Eastmain and Rupert Rivers."
"And in 1996, Kattuk served on the Nunavut Water Board, a body created by the 1993 Nunavut land claims agreement."
"The late Peter Kattuk speaks in the Nunavut legislature on Feb. 19, 2008, near the end of his second term as MLA for Hudson Bay."
"Kono Tattuinee, the president of Arctic Co-operatives Ltd., remembers Kattuk as “quite an extraordinary kind of guy,” who introduced Tattuinee to sea urchins, a local delicacy in the Belcher Islands."
"When Paul Okalik, then the Nunavut premier, appointed Kattuk as minister responsible for the old Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, he said Kattuk promoted Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit long before it became fashionable."
"“Peter participated in a study of traditional knowledge long before it was a hot topic,” Okalik said at a news conference in April 2000."
"After becoming public works minister in 2001, Kattuk had to deal with the notorious “bad gas” uproar."
That happened after the Northern Transportation Co. Ltd. had shipped gasoline supplies to Nunavut that destroyed snowmobile engines all over the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.
"In that role, Kattuk presided over another controversy: the Government of Nunavut’s decision to drop NTCL and award its lucrative annual fuel resupply contract to the Woodward Group of Labrador."
"He sought re-election to the legislature in October 2017, but finished third behind Alan Rumbolt."
"“Peter was well-respected for his commitment to public service and his environmental advocacy,” Mikkungwak said in his statement."
"Nunavik’s new MP says she will push for housing money, implementing UNDRIP"
Sylvie Bérubé plans to visit in the New Year and is seeking an Inuktitut translator

Nunavik’s new MP says she wants to hear from the region’s Inuit leaders so that she can better share their concerns.
MP Sylvie Bérubé won the Abitibi-James Bay-Nunavik-Eeyou riding in the fall federal election with 37.7 per cent of the vote.
"While the Bloc Québécois MP is primarily French speaking, she said she is actively searching for an Inuktitut translator to work with."
"“I wish to clearly report the needs in the Indigenous communities,” she said."
"So far, Bérubé said that two pressing issues she’s aware of in Nunavik are health care and housing."
"Health care may be under provincial jurisdiction, but it’s federally funded, said Bérubé."
"In order to see an increase in that health funding, Bérubé said the federal government could reconsider how it calculates the transfers."
Bérubé has worked in the health sector for more than three decades.
"In the Bloc Québécois election platform, the party stated the province would need 10,000 homes over the next decade."
"It’s something Bérubé said she is already in talks about, to have different models for housing development drawn up."
"“If we want the [federal] Liberals to move forward, we will have to propose a solution ourselves,” Bérubé said."
"The new MP may not be a familiar face in Nunavik, but said she plans to visit for the next annual general meeting of Makivik Corp., which will place in March."
"Following Bérubé’s election, Makivik President Charlie Watt released a statement inviting Bérubé up to visit the region at her earliest convenience."
"“I look forward to meeting with her, and receiving her support for our work on self-determination, and on issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,” Watt said."
"It is those talks with Inuit leadership, Bérubé said, that will determine her role in helping along Makivik’s work on self-determination,"
"On Bill C-262, which would bring Canadian law in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Bérubé is fully in support."
"Two versions of the bill were put forward by her predecessor, outgoing NDP MP Romeo Saganash."
"Introduced in 2018, Bill C-262 was held up by Conservative senators this spring but the Liberal government’s representative in the chamber, Senator Peter Harder, said if re-elected, the Liberal government was committed to making it law."
"“It is important for me to continue the process of Bill C-262 to align Canadian laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the work of my predecessor Romeo Saganash,” Bérubé said."
“I will continue to support this project and I’ve already offered my support to Romeo for future action.
It’s unacceptable that Canada is not yet at this stage by 2020.”
The Trudeau government 2.0: prepare for a letdown
"“If you’re wise, you’ll keep your expectations low”"
"Jane Philpott, then the Indigenous services minister, is seen on March 23, 2018, with ITK President Natan Obed, while promising that the federal government will eliminate tuberculosis from Inuit Nunangat by 2030."
"Less than a year later, she quit the federal cabinet."
"You may have noticed that during the recent federal election campaign, none of the national party leaders spent much time talking about issues that matter to residents of Nunavut and other northern regions."
That’s no surprise.
"The major political parties appeared to have calculated that across mainstream Canada, which means southern Canada, there are few votes to be gained by talking about remote northern regions most southern Canadians have never heard of."
"The Liberal government signalled that themselves, with their dump-and-run release of the much-delayed Arctic and northern policy framework the day before the campaign period officially started."
"During the election campaign, Indigenous-specific issues, many of which overlap with northern issues, didn’t get much attention either."
"So for the new reduced version of Justin Trudeau’s government, whose cabinet members took their oaths of office this past Nov. 20, all signs point to a continuation of that indifferent attitude."
Here’s just one example.
It concerns one of the most significant promises to the North the Trudeau government has made since gaining power in 2015: to eliminate 50 per cent of tuberculosis cases from Inuit Nunangat by 2025 and to eliminate the disease entirely by 2030.
"That included a starter fund of $27.5 million over five years, the spending of which is “self-determined” by the four members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami."
"But that bold pledge already smells like a broken promise. For starters, the TB elimination campaign has lost its most credible and competent federal government champion: Jane Philpott, the Indigenous services minister who made that promise."
She quit Trudeau’s cabinet this past March 4 to protest his shabby treatment of Jody Wilson-Raybould.
She did so only four days before Trudeau flew to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada’s mistreatment of Inuit patients with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.
"Since then, a cone of silence has descended on the Arctic tuberculosis issue."
"Even during the election campaign, it received little attention."
"And as of now, work on TB elimination appears to have ground to a halt."
"For example, in Nunatsiavut, where the active TB rate between 2006 and 2016 was recorded at 248.5 per 100,000, health authorities have done only one community-wide screening."
"That occurred in Nain, in 2018, following a major outbreak in which scores of people developed active TB and a 14-year-old boy died of the disease at a hospital in St. John’s."
"In Nunavik, 313 people got sick with TB between 2006 and 2016, creating the second-worst incidence rate in Inuit Nunangat, 234 cases per 100,000."
"But no community-wide screenings appear to have been done in Nunavik since early 2018, when Philpott made her announcement."
"Indeed, most of Nunavik’s recent mass screenings appear to have occurred in reaction to earlier TB outbreaks, when Stephen Harper’s Conservatives were still in power, long before Trudeau’s Liberal government was elected."
"As for Nunavut, where 670 people developed active TB between 2006 and 2016, producing an incidence rate of 171.8 per 100,000, there has been some modest activity."
(One major exception is the Inuvialuit settlement region of the Northwest Territories.
"There, no active TB cases were reported between 2007 and 2016.)"
Tuberculosis is a disease of poverty.
"That’s been pointed out so often, it’s become a cliché."
But it’s true.
"Where people are poorly nourished and poorly housed, tuberculosis thrives."
"Take, for example, the poverty to be found in Cape Dorset, where a 12-week TB screening program ended last May."
The 2016 unemployment rate was 27.3 per cent.
"The median income in 2015 for those aged 15 and over was $18,933."
"Of 370 dwelling units, 120 were in need of major repairs."
"And by the national measure of overcrowdedness, 140 of those 370 units were deemed “unsuitable” by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation standards."
That means they don’t have enough bedrooms to accommodate the number of people who live in them.
There are few places in Canada where people are more poorly housed.
"It’s no wonder, then, that over the past two decades, TB became a public health emergency in Nunavut and other Arctic regions."
And it’s inconceivable that TB can be eliminated in these communities without a dramatic increase in the number and quality of social housing units.
"But during the run-up to the last election campaign, Trudeau’s party offered nothing on Inuit housing, other than a regurgitation of 2016 and 2017 federal budget commitments."
"On this issue, they can’t even be accused of breaking a promise. Such was their indifference that they never made one in the first place."
"That, in essence, represents how they’ve responded to one of Canada’s worst public health emergencies, where the rate of active tuberculosis in the Inuit regions is more than 300 times greater than the rate found among the non-Indigenous Canadian-born population."
"And in Nunavut, it might be even worse than we think."
A report last year found more than one in every 100 infants in Nunavut may have the disease.
"So if that indifference characterizes their response to a dire public health emergency, how much indifference are the Trudeau Liberals likely to show on other issues, such as mental health, community infrastructure, post-secondary education, and so on?"
"If you’re wise, you’ll keep your expectations low."
"If you don’t, you’d better prepare yourself for a big letdown."
"Note: The quoted statistics on TB prevalence are sourced from ITK’s Inuit Tuberculosis Elimination Framework, released in November 2018."
The statistics on Cape Dorset are sourced from a Statistics Canada report based on data gathered during the 2016 census.
New year will see new recruits and tech for Nunavik police

"After months of low staffing levels, the Kativik Regional Police Force is seeing the fruits of its aggressive recruiting efforts."
Police chief Jean-Pierre Larose updated councillors at the Kativik Regional Government meeting on Nov. 26 on progress so far.
That includes the graduation of 10 new KRPF recruits from the Ontario Police College this week.
The recruitment program also included connecting with recently retired southern officers about coming up to work in the Kativik region.
"Because of the staffing shortage, the KRPF has had officers from the provincial force, the Sûreté du Québec, filling out the complement."
"In September, there were 20 SQ officers in Nunavik."
"The number of SQ officers has slowly decreased with the KRPF’s recruiting efforts, and Larose said by early 2020 they should no longer need provincial officers."
Cultural awareness training kicks off
An Inuit cultural awareness training program for KRPF officers is also now online as of Nov. 18.
"The training was co-developed by the KRPF and Laval University and includes general information on Nunavik, Inuit culture, and the history of policing in the region."
"That three-hour training program is followed by an exam, which is factored into their interview."
"“This part of the training will help KRPF select its new officers based on their cultural sensitivity,” Larose said."
"The second part of the training is nine hours long and will be mandatory for all officers, said Larose."
It’s expected to be completed early in the new year.
Cameras to be worn by officers
Another addition to the force that was welcomed by councillors is the use of cameras to be worn by some officers while on duty.
"This is a pilot project, with six cameras currently ready for use."
"“The pilot project has been initiated in response to the request of Nunavimmiut for the KRPF to be more transparent in their police operations,” Larose said."
“It is KRPF’s goal to increase and maintain the trust between the population and its officers.”
Kuujjuaq councillor Jobie Tukkiapik was hopeful the cameras would provide reassurance to people who have had negative experiences with the police.
“We hear about mistreatment by police and for those that were mistreated they don’t want to disclose.
"They are intimidated by police,” Tukkiapik said."
“These body cameras need to be used.”
"He added that even when it’s just one or two officers mistreating people, it has a much larger effect, creating concerns about the whole force."
"He hoped the cameras, which record events the officer is involved in, would be put to use as soon as possible."
Larose said they would start using the cameras in January.
He also responded that any aggressive or inappropriate behaviour would not be accepted on the force.
"“I fired a police officer last week that was not conforming to our goal for policing in Nunavik,” he said."
“We will not tolerate any cocky police officer in Nunavik.”
Nunavut’s neighbours gather to discuss the future of renewable energy in the Arctic
"Representatives from Greenland, Canada and U.S. talk ideas and lessons learned"

Renewable energy experts from across the Arctic gathered in Iqaluit on Nov. 21 and Nov. 22 to share ideas and lessons learned when operating in the North.
"Participants from Nunavut, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and the United States discussed the failures of different projects in their respective regions."
"The workshop, called Optimizing Operations, Integrating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders, was organized by the U.S. Department of State in partnership with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corp."
"Bruno Pereira, president of QEC, said the workshop was a chance to learn from each other."
"“In terms of adopting renewable energy in our communities, we’re very interested in looking at other jurisdictions, seeing what’s made them successful or some of the pitfalls that they’ve encountered,” Pereira said."
"Pereira also said that although it was important to bring representatives from Arctic communities together to discuss green energy possibilities, there are different challenges in Nunavut than in Alaska, for example."
"“Some of those communities have road access, so they’re not really remote in the context of Nunavut communities."
"But they face some of the same challenges we face, in terms of logistics, getting the technical skills in those communities, so we do see similarities.”"
"Chris Rose, executive director of the Renewable Energy Alaska Project, said the state’s investments through the Alaska Renewable Energy Fund have helped its renewable energy projects to flourish."
“So we’ve been able to build about 80 projects in remote communities that include renewable energy on top of the existing diesel grid.
"So I think we just have a lot of experience now that’s starting to pay off,” Rose said."
"That fund, which is designed to promote the development of renewable energy projects, provides benefits to Alaskans by reducing and stabilizing the cost of energy."
"Rose said in Southwest Alaska, five communities have worked together to install refurbished wind turbines that they now share energy from."
"“So now there’s this cross-pollination of understanding of how to operate and maintain these turbines and they help each other install them,” Rose said."
"In Alaska, as in Nunavut, home heating bills are very expensive."
"Rose said the communities using wind turbines have found a way to use excess wind energy to not only power their homes, but to help heat them too."
“The way they’ve done that is by putting small resistance heaters in people’s homes that are surrounded by ceramic tiles.
"So when there’s excess wind electricity goes into those heaters, and they’ve essentially built a small smart grid so that the wind heaters can talk to the power plant operators electronically,” Rose said."
"“But because those ceramic heaters can store heat, it’s an interruptible load."
"It can be turned on and off in the home without really impacting the people’s comfort, plus they have a backup heater.”"
"But in Greenland, installing wind turbines has proved difficult, according to Niels Erik Hagelqvist, a technical special advisor on renewable energy in Nuuk."
"Cold temperatures and long periods of darkness make it difficult for wind turbines designed for the south to work in the North, Hagelqvist said."
"Hagelqvist said although two turbines that were successful in other parts of the world were installed in northern Greenland, they ended up failing."
“We say in Greenland that we prefer proven technology.
"Even these two wind turbines we put up, they have been established, one of them in 200 different places in the whole world and the other one 150 different places,” he said."
"One of the turbine’s blades fell off, while for the other, the oil used to lubricate its gears became too thick in the cold temperatures and caused the engine to break down, Hagelqvist explained."
"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three parties promised that if elected they would get Nunavut off diesel by 2030."
"Although it will take some time to develop renewable energy projects that function in the Arctic, Hagelqvist said the need for green energy is urgent."
"“We have to do something to replace all the diesel fuel and all the normal oil, because of global warming, because something is going wrong at the moment."
"It’s a political question if you will have this green energy, because you have the technology but you don’t have the money."
"You can do it if you have enough money,” he said."
Pereira said there is a lot to learn through discussions with Nunavut’s Arctic neighbours.
"“I think it really allows us to consider other options, in terms of how we start a transition process on incorporating renewables."
Some people have used some technology and they’ve gone through the process of having failures with things that worked in the south but not in the North.
"So when we get to the point where the financial situation allows us to adopt some of that, we can maybe avoid some of the pitfalls they’ve gone through,” Pereira said."
The Nunavut government needs to involve Inuit more in its Education Act overhaul: NTI
“This is a fundamental policy change that will affect many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut”
"Aluki Kotierk, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., speaks during the the standing committee on legislation’s hearing on Bill 25, An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."

Re: Education Minister David Joanasie’s letter to the editor on Bill 25
"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter published by Nunatsiaq News on Nov. 25, 2019, referencing past exchanges between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated on Bill 25, characterizing these exchanges as motivated by good faith and offering NTI ample opportunity to voice concerns."
The minister is of the view that inviting NTI to public meetings and allowing NTI to listen to the GN’s views at meetings is collaboration.
It is not.
"Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, and in the design of social and cultural programs and services, including their method of delivery."
There is a fundamental difference.
"Bill 25 proposes to amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act, setting out the policy and the method of delivery for the Inuit language of instruction."
This is a fundamental policy change that will affect many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut.
"As such, Inuit have the right to participate in its development and design."
NTI was not provided the opportunity to participate in the development of the policy aspirations outlined in the legislative proposal for Bill 25.
"Not only is this contrary to the government obligations outlined in the Nunavut Agreement, experience demonstrates that past partnerships led to the passing of legislation that better incorporated Inuit goals and objectives."
"NTI has in the past co-developed legislation with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."
"Knowing it can be done, NTI reached out to the premier and the ministers on Jan. 8, 2018, conveying NTI’s willingness to constructively work with the newly elected government in active partnership and collaboration on Inuit priorities, including on education, language and culture."
"The Department of Education did not provide its legislative proposal to NTI until Aug. 31, 2018, when the department provided its list of planned community consultations."
This left NTI less than a week to analyse Bill 25 and prepare and plan for the Nunavut consultation tour.
This is not collaboration.
"The department hosted the consultations with a narrow scope, and did not make any attempts to significantly address or accommodate concerns raised by Inuit, NTI and other organizations such as the district education authorities and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities, who also attended."
"I remind the minister of education again that the Nunavut Agreement clearly outlines the obligations to fulfil Article 32, and that the Department must act purposively, with due diligence and uphold honour of the Crown when it collaborates with Inuit."
"NTI believes that rewriting of the Education Act in fulfilment of Inuit participation obligations requires a fundamental change in the department’s approach, and full recognition of Inuit rights."
