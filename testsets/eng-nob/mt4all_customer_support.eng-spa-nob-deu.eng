Dear Mrs. Johnson,
I am very sorry about the difficulty you encountered recently before receiving your last order from us.
I understand that those products were required for urgent purposes.
Despite our effort to deliver your order on time using Skynet Express Delivery Service, it’s quite unfortunate that we didn’t meet up with the time allotted for the delivery of those products.
We are very sorry for truncating your plans for these products, and we will do our best to ensure this never happens again.
Already, we are discussing with other express courier services to ensure our customers get their orders in time.
We promise to impress you when you make your next order.
If you have any other question or need further assistance from me, please feel free to call me directly on +2348157479837.

Dear Mr. George,
I agree with you that the latest Woculus Reader’s Journal which you ordered got to you but has some missing pages.
Despite this publication mishap, you read the journal and kept it with you for at least two weeks.
I am sorry for this printing error on the copy of Woculus Readers’ Journal you purchased.
However, I can neither receive the return nor refund you as you demanded.
This is because of our company’s policy.
We make refunds only for orders whose complaints are received within two weeks of purchase.
We greatly esteem your relationship with our company and are very sorry for the inconveniences you have suffered as a result of the printing errors in the Journals you received from us.
It is unfortunate that we cannot exchange the Journal at this time due to our policies and the time it has spent with you.
We promise to offer you the best services possible always. Please accept our apologies and feel free to call me anytime on +2348157479837.
Cordially
Tina Bash

Hi James,
I’m Mary and I work as Head of Content in Acme Inc.
I learned from the Account Manager that you have an interesting insight on customer service strategy.
I think this is a fascinating issue that many people would enjoy reading about.
This gave me the idea of doing an ebook where we’ll talk about customer service strategy and provide advice for other companies.
Our team could do the writing based on our research and your insights.
This ebook would be promoted across both our networks.
What do you think?
We can have a call some time this week to discuss and bounce ideas off each other.
Looking forward to collaborating with you.
Thanks,

In the future, I will be sure to ask several questions of my customers to fully understand the situation before offering a solution.
I hope you can forgive me and that we can continue to work together if you have any more support needs.
Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
Best,
Alex
To our valuable Acme customers,
We're sorry.
At noon today, we experienced a system outage, which affected a number of our customers.
We know what it feels like to be waiting for a resolution to a problem, and we're sorry we put you in that situation.
We are lucky to have you as Acme customers, and on January 13, we failed to provide the experience you deserve.
To help make it better, we are doing a full analysis on this issue, the root cause, the impact, and how to prevent this from happening again.
Thank you for your patience with us as we dig in and get back to helping you grow.
Sincerely,
Acme
Dear Anna,
On behalf of Acme, I want to extend our apologies for your experience with our subscription services.
From our understanding, the outage prevented you from accessing our services.
We sincerely regret this misfortunate incident and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
At Acme, our mission is to help people grow, but in this case, we failed to deliver that experience.
Thank you again for bringing this to my attention, and I sincerely appreciate your patience with us as we work to resolve this issue.
I'm confident your next experience with our employees will be up to the high standard that you've come to expect from Acme
Sincerely,
Patrick
Whoops – sorry!
It appears you got an email by mistake.
At 10:00 am on 2021/12/01, we sent out a message to our VIP customers.
However, the communication got sent to more people than we had intended.
Please disregard our previous email – we hate unnecessary email more than anyone, so we hope you accept our sincere apologies.
Best,
Janet
Good morning, Ruth,
It’s been brought to my attention that you recently had a negative interaction with one of our customer service agents.
I’m here to apologize.
The agent’s  actions, pure and simple, were unacceptable, and on behalf of the entire company, I’m sorry.
Following a review of the situation, we have decided to assign you a new account rep.
We want you to know we respect and value you, so to make up for this, we’re giving you a $25 Amazon voucher.
We know this doesn’t excuse or erase the situation, but we hope this reassures you that your respect and trust is our first priority.
If you ever want to discuss things further, we’re here for you.
Do not hesitate to reach out to us and let us know how we can make things right.
Thank you,
Dennis
Dear Jerry,
It seems that you were incorrectly charged on your bill, resulting in your overpayment.
I apologize for this mistake.
We value your business and would hate for you to lose trust in us.
We know this kind of slip-up is unacceptable, and again, we’re sorry.
We’ve refunded your account $154.
You should see the amount credited within 48 hours– please let us know if you do not see the amount returned by then.
The reason for the error was an oversight on our side.
In the future, we’ll be certain to avoid this problem by reinforcing our operational procedures.
I hope this resolution makes up for the error, but if you do feel like we can do more, I encourage you to let us know.
We know this kind of mistake is not one to be taken lightly, and we want you to feel good about how we handled it.
Sincerely,
Maria
Dear Heather,
We’re so sorry – it appears there’s been a mixup that caused you to receive the incorrect shipment rather than what you had ordered.
This was completely our fault, and we hope you’ll accept our apology for the inconvenience that this caused.
We know you value reliable shipping, and we apologize for letting you down.
We’ve shipped out your correct order.
It will arrive within 5 business days.
We’ve also included an extra gift as a way to say thank you for your patience.
As for the order you received, a courier will pick it up from your home in the next 72 hours..
We hate letting our customers down, and we’re sorry to say that’s exactly what happened here.
We hope you’ll give us another chance to win your trust back.
Thank you,
Diane
Hi Aaron
I hope you’re doing well today!
I’m so glad to hear that our product has been working so well for you and your team.
I knew that by working together, we’d be able to drive a significant impact for your brand.
Given the success you’ve seen, I wondered if you might know of any colleagues who are also looking to improve their blog’s SEO”.
I would love to help them achieve the same results you’ve seen.
Kind regards,
Jose
Hi Diane
I was delighted to hear when we last spoke that our product has been serving you and your team well.
Nothing makes me happier than helping my clients.
My goal is to help as many people as possible to develop great leaders.
Since you’ve seen what we can do for a business firsthand, I was wondering if you would be willing to refer us to a friend.
I generally charge $50 for a 30-minute consultation, but I’m happy to provide a completely free consultation for anyone you refer to me.
When they book a consultation, all they have to do is put the following personalized code in: ACME333.
If you do end up passing along the referral code, you’ll also get 10% off our next 3 sessions together.
Do you have anyone in mind who might want to take advantage of that benefit?
Thanks,
Virginia
Dear Nathan,
I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for referring your friend to me!
It means so much to me that you were happy enough with the work that we did together to share my name with someone who you want to see succeed.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help her design a great online shop, too.
As a thank-you, I’d love to take 10% off of your next bill.
I’m making a note to do so right now.
Thanks again,
Adam
Dear Zac
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to introduce me to Kelly.
It means a lot to me that you trust my work enough to give her your vote of confidence in me.
I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with you and sincerely thank you for your continued support.
I’m looking forward to our next chance to drive results together.
With appreciation,
Douglas
Dear Peter
I wanted to take a moment to thank you for referring Kyle to me.
I know you’re incredibly busy, and I’m so happy that you felt strongly enough about the results we drove to share my name with someone you trust.
If I can be of service at any point in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out -- I’d be thrilled to work together again.
Kind regards,
Lauren

Hi, Giona,
Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us and sharing your feedback!
For the benefit of your future subscription, we may need to troubleshoot this a little further — feel free to try these out and see if they work:
Force quit app -> reopen -> log back in
Uninstall app -> reinstall -> log back in
Restart phone/turn phone off then on
Your phone’s software itself should be fully updated (Android or iOS)
We update the Acme app as often as possible to make it faster and more reliable for you.
We’ve seen a lot of similar cases resolve when the above actions are taken.
In the meantime, if you’re still experiencing technical setbacks, I will gather a little more info about your phone to ensure our engineering teams can take the next steps with a fix 🙂
Cheers,
Alberto

I have canceled the subscription under your email as requested.

Hi Kate,
Thanks for getting in touch.
I am sorry to hear that the charge took you by surprise.
When you initially subscribed, this triggered a 7-day trial, and as you didn’t opt-out from this, the full annual amount was charged.
If you don’t wish to take advantage of this, you can contact Apple directly.
I’m afraid that we can only manage payments that were made via our website.
Only Apple can help with payment-related questions for iTunes purchases, as they don’t allow developers to access or edit their users’ subscription settings.
I am very sorry that we are not able to provide a better solution for you and hope the above helps.
Please let me know if you have any further questions about your subscription, or if I can do anything else to help.
Thank you,
Chas
Hi Sean,
Thanks for writing in. We’re happy to refund the charge completely but hope that you might consider maintaining your subscription.
What do you say if we offer you a 20% discount for this billing period?
I would adjust the current charge and send a refund of the difference.
Looking forward to your feedback!
Cheers,
Bea
Hi Mike,
We are sorry to see you go!
I was able to refund the charge and cancel the subscription.
We’re always looking to improve our services and would love to hear your feedback, so we prepared a few questions for you: www.acme.survey.
It won’t take long, we promise!✌️
Thanks for helping make Acme Corporation awesome.
Cheers,
Marvin

We value your feedback, and we would like to offer some suggestions.
If you experience these symptoms – runny nose, stuffy nose, coughing, etc. then there is a possibility that you are having a reaction to an ingredient in our products.

Our Customer Service agents are available Mondays to Fridays from 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM EST.

Hi Nayib,
No worries!
I just canceled the order and refunded USD109.41 on the Mastercard ending in 5678.
You should see it reflected on your card in about 5-10 business days! 😉

Isabella
Dear Mara,
Thank you for getting in touch with us.
Your business is greatly valued.
I am sorry that the size you had ordered was the wrong one.
I’d recommend getting the (correct and recommended product), and then return the one that didn’t fit comfortably.
There will be a $30 restocking fee deducted from the refund by the system, but we’ll send it back to you manually.
Just shoot us a message here once you’ve got the partial refund and it will be taken care of.
I hope this helps! 🙂
Cheers,
Seth
Hi Stephanie,
I’m Elena, one of the Support Specialists here at Acme Corp.
Thanks for reaching out and letting us know about the issues you are experiencing with your purchase.
I can’t begin to convey my apologies for your experience.
That’s not how we like to roll here at Acme.
I was able to gather more information regarding your experience, and it does look like there was a communication issue with your purchase.
Not to worry, because I have refunded any costs associated with this order for you.
Please allow 5-10 business days for that to fully process, depending on your bank.
Again, we apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you.
Please let us know if there are any further questions or concerns you may have.
We are always happy to assist.
Best wishes,
Elena
Hi Maarten,
I have already processed your refund, and you should expect to see the full amount in your bank account within 5-10 days.
I am sorry you did not enjoy using our service.
Your feedback here would be most appreciated for us to do better in the future.
If you are still considering any other possible choice that would help you, I’d be delighted to answer any questions you may have and introduce other options to you.
I do hope you would remain as our valued customer and thank you for your time.
Best regards,

Hi Paul,
Thank you for contacting Acme customer care.
We are sorry about the confusion regarding your subscription.
The Acme Pro subscription with a 14-day free trial was accepted as part of your sign-up for the subscription.
Unfortunately, as you did not cancel within the 14-day free trial period, and there was no contact made before this correspondence, the subscription was renewed for its paid period after the trial ended.
Although we don’t generally process any refunds for canceled pre-paid subscriptions, we have reviewed your account and refunded the charges to you, as a courtesy for our valued customer.
We have also gone ahead and canceled this subscription to ensure that there will be no future charges.
Please note that it may take 5-7 business days for the money to be reflected on your bank statement depending on your financial institution.
Hopefully, this helps.
Please let us know if there’s anything else we can help you with.
Thank you for your understanding.
Cheers,
Thomas
Hi Ashley,
Thanks for writing in.
I see that you subscribed via iTunes.
We do not manage these payments and can only offer discounts for purchases made via our website – this is why we never link to app stores in our offers.
I’m afraid we are unable to apply for a partial refund for this, but here’s what you can do: deactivate your current subscription’s auto-renew function within iTunes and re-subscribe after expiration through our website with the code ‘30off’ – this will apply a 30% discount on the first billing period via the website.
Here’s a guide on how to deactivate the auto-renewal in your app store: (www.acme.com/guide).
I’m sorry if our communication hasn’t been clear enough in this regard and hope that the offer is a good compromise for you.
Cheers

Hi Lyman,
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that! 🙁
I understand it must be very upsetting for you.
We can most certainly help you here.
Please use our biggest discount available ACME098890 for 30% off your next purchase.
You’ll also get a popup message offering a free 2-month subscription that is currently being offered to new customers so do take advantage of that as well.
I hope this helps and have a brilliant year ahead!
If there’s anything else that I can help with you, do let me know.
