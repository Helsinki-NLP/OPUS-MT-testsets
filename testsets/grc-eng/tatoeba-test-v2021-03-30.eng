Are, then, these people to believe you are doing this for them?
I went to one of the men who seemed to be wise, thinking that there I should test the oracle.
My name is Nobody.
I love you.
We live in a house.
Where was he going?
For the field is small, but the work is great.
Stop, that you be not found foolish.
Won't you ever speak?
Is it enough?
You're diligent.
Tom is a terrible farmer.
Each person judges well the things he knows.
They that have judgment everywhere prevail.
By that time it was late, and they would not be likely to see the hands.
I see the book.
Tom is strong.
The soldiers follow the leader.
Hasten slowly.
I don't trust them.
For he might have stood his ground.
Where's the boy?
Ariaios will at once withdraw, so that not a friend will be left us.
But (I suspect) that is not difficult.
We're diligent.
Neither be afraid nor let fly an evil word.
Oinoë had been fortifed.
Echetla is a Sicilian city.
Tom was there.
Therefore, a young person is not an appropriate student of politics.

The market is large.
They aren't farmers.
Why then do you delay to tell the whole?
I should hesitate myself to go aboard the boats.
Why are you driving us out?
What, then, is this? Distrust. Guard this, cling to this.
You have heard, seen, suffered, you have him; give judgment.
I have often wondered.
We live in a house.
These he used to distribute to his friends.
Don't make noise.
Where is the road?
I had to go therefore to all those who appeared to have some knowledge.
The hospital is near here.
There was a village near the sea.
I enjoy being honored by you.
The sheep are in the pen.
You have heard, seen, suffered.

What does the fox say?
Virtue is a thing that may be taught.
Where is the dog?
Where is the mother?
You write well.
Everything flows.

I know that I know nothing.
Jesus' mother was there.
Everything flows and nothing stays still.

Do you live in Athens?

Picking out the right man, he would strike him.
The goal of medicine is health.
Toil to toil brings toil.

We don't trust them.
How beautiful she is!
Where is the woman?
Save us.
Save me.
Every action and every undertaking seem to aim at some good.
The friend educates the friend.
This is how it is.
One must learn letters, and learning them have sense.
I grow old always learning many things.
But at that time they had revolted.
I live in Athens.
And among them rose the hero son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, lamenting: his blackened heart brimming over with rage, and his eyes like blazing fires.
We don't trust him.
Let it be otherwise.
Is Tom telling the truth?
Thou remindest me of sorrows.
Let me not be wronged.
What do they have in mind?
Either with it or on it.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
As a test of this, first go to Pytho and inquire about the response.
Cyrus he sends for.
With you I will suffer whatever we must.
Tom is working with Mary.
He was plainly not envious of the openly wealthy.
They kept using the enemiesʼ arrows.
Time for dinner.
The one thing I know is that I know nothing.
The house is small but beautiful.
So may I win the victory and be deemed wise.
You show that you have something new to reveal.
In that way you would have revenged yourself on me.
What does he see?
He endured to sacrifice his daughter, as an aid to war.
What I do not know, I also do not think I know.
Dicaeopolis is not present.
Though it was in my power not to die for you, but to get as husband whom I would of the Thessalians.
I gave it to her.
The house is small.
Each is one, but together two.
We were farmers.

Don't trust strangers.
I work on my own.
There he remained.
Custom is the king of all.
I am about to suffer.
Truly my mother bore me as one of evil fate.
Where is the food?
The cows are in danger.
Shall I make no reply, but say something else?
Everything flows.
In that case (Athens) would have got the blame of betraying all.
What do you do after work?
Why don't you stay here?
The poets, Thucydides and Euripides, were students of Anaxagoras.
Don't trust Tom.
It is shameful for you that any (penalty) whatever should be lacking which any one might wish to exact from these men.
If that is so, we have to try to comprehend what it is.
Tom killed a tiger.
How should I find death?
But take her within, slaves.
What shall we say to this? Anything else than to agree?
But in that case the matter would have been decided by itself.
Why, yes, we should have done this and this, and not have done that.
God always measures.
You will not convince the wise (I fear).
I don't want to go to school.
What will happen to me?
To what man was he probably sailing?
They want peace.
Nothing in excess.
A truce if we stay; if we leave or advance, war.
What art thou that hast come to glorious Thebes?
Let them go.
Always seeking the truth.
Where is the man?
We at least must make a struggle for freedom.
Art is far weaker than necessity.
Does he say it of his own knowledge?
Sleep tight.
I don't trust strangers.
What's that thing in your right hand?
Tom's house is large.
It is like a criminal to die by sentence of court, but like a general to die fighting with the enemy.
Where is the sun?
I see the boy.
No one fights with us any longer.
She used to be diligent.
Tom is looking for the rope.
He never had men who followed him by reason of affection and gοod-will.
Beware lest it be shameful too as well as evil.
Shall I report a truce or war?
They killed him.
They don't trust Tom.

Stand out of my sun.
What shall I experience?
Be so kind, then, as to give me this gift.

O that I had so much power!
This tree does not bear fruit.
For he would not injure me at all; for he would not even be able to.
You say you spoke against those who wished to destroy us.
Don't run away.
Tom writes well.
I shall obey the god rather than you.
The man loves the house.
I shall not be caught by a trick.
Tom is safe.
And by force you would never take him.
It is no time for sleeping or for being careless of ourselves.
What are you doing?
Most wretchedly by far do I go down.
I have two cats.
Come here and help.
Are you in danger?
Shall I then propose the penalty of exile?
Mary doesn't like Tom.
Do not in any case flee.

But I care less than naught for Zeus.
The woman is working.

I live in the country.
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
