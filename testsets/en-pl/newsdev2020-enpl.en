Bosnians protest Croatian plans for nuclear waste facility
Hundreds of people rallied Friday in northwest Bosnia against plans by neighboring Croatia to store part of the waste from the region's only nuclear plant near its border with Bosnia and a main river known for its natural beauty.
The protesters in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad urged Croatia to abandon plans for a storage site at a former army barracks in Trgovska Gora and pledged to fight the project.
The facility would hold waste from the Krsko nuclear plant.
Holding banners reading "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - the Una (river) needs us," Bosnians they said a nuclear waste facility could endanger the Una River and the lives of around 250,000 area residents.
We have to say NO!
Miroslav Drljaca, the head of Novi Grad municipality told the crowd.
We must fight to preserve our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the 1980s" Krsko plant is owned jointly by Croatia.
Officials from the two countries are set to meet next week to discuss additional waste storage facilities.
Croatia's state HRT television reported Friday that Croatia was yet to decide whether it would build storage of its own or pay to store its share of waste at a new facility Slovenia is building.
Croatian Minister of Environment Protection and Energy Tomislav Coric told the broadcaster that Croatia also has a problem disposing of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and was hoping to find an overall solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country nearer to the nuclear.
"How come that out of entire Croatia, the best is the Trgovska Gora pocket that is in Bosnia's pants?" asked Drljaca.
We must not let them humiliate us!

American Congress agreed to sell 32 F-35 jets to Poland
Within 15 days from the Department of State approving the possible purchase of 32 multi-task F-35 jets by Poland, the U.S. Congress did not raise any objection to the transaction, which means that the last condition was met before commencing sales negotiations.
The Congress' decision, although not unexpected, carries large political significance.
"Once the Department of State and now the Congress approved the sales, I see no serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior research fellow for the defence policy at the Washington-based conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.
The expert explained that, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the federal government, represented by the Department of State, is obliged to inform the Congress of each planned sales of arms abroad 15 days before concluding a sales contract, if the value of such transaction, in case of selling arms to a NATO member, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 jets by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount will include costs of technical and logistic aid, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
Should the transaction be finalized, the main supplier of the F-35 jets will be the American arms company Lockheed Martin, with Pratt and Whitney, manufacturer of F-35A jet engines, as its subcontractor.
The offer to purchase 5th generation American F-35 jets on behalf of Poland was submitted by Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of this year, during a meeting held at the White House between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump.
If finalized, the execution of the contract will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon as part of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.
Under the FMS program, Poland has already purchased the Patriot anti-ballistic missile system, among others.
The price of one F-35 jet at the moment when Poland submitted its purchase offer equalled, without arming and technical help, ca. $89.2 million.
As per the information conveyed to the Polish Press Agency by military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, such price given during the initial negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the one that will be negotiated".
"The prices are decreasing rapidly; the current price of one F-35 is below $80 million – much less than the cost of a Eurofighter, which does not share the same qualities as F-35", Venable indicated.
Polish Press Agency interlocutors expressed their hopes that the negotiations regarding the purchase of American fighter aircraft by Poland will be completed this year.
Possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this deal, i.e. offset, will be discussed directly with American manufacturers of F-35 jets.
What is Munchhausen's by proxy mentioned in The Politician on Netflix?
The condition means carers or parents pretend their child is ill when they are healthy.
The Politican hits Netflix today.
The show tells the story of Payton Hobart who wants to be President of the United States of America - but first, he has to be student body president at his high school.
Made by American Horror Story and Glee creator Ryan Murphy, it features Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too much for those who haven't had a chance to watch it yet, the show includes a storyline about Munchhausen's by proxy - a mental illness where a carer acts as if the person they are looking after has a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick.
There are different types of the condition, including Munchhausen's where a person pretends that they themselves are ill.
Munchhausen's By Proxy, however, is specifically about making up that someone that you care for is ill.
It is also known as fabricated or induced illness (FII) and is categorised as child abuse.
It is a rare condition and usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it seem like their child is ill.
What are the signs of Munchhausen's by proxy?
The signs of the condition can vary from case to case but the NHS says that things to be aware of include:
Persuading medical professionals that their child is unwell but they seem healthy.
Exaggerating or lying about symptoms.
Manipulating results to suggest the child is ill, for example putting glucose in urine samples to make it look like they have diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of illness, for example giving them unnecessary medication or other substances.
How common is Munchhausen's by proxy?
As many cases aren't reported, it's difficult to know how widespread the condition is.
One study published in 2000 estimated 89 cases in a population of 100,000 over a two year period.
What should you do if you think a child is at risk
You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police Raid Kaduna School, Evacuate 300 Children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police Command yesterday raided a school, Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal, located at Layin Maidubun Tsumma at Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of the state, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police alleged that the children were kept in a very dehumanising condition; an allegation the school authority denied.
A resident who identified himself as Shehu, a preacher in the school, said: "What they're saying is not true because all the children are there with the consent of their parents.
The parents signed a form before the children were enrolled in the school.
The parents used to bring food to their children daily and they also know the condition they are in.
We were very surprised when the police came and evacuated the children as well as removed all the students' food brought by their parents before they shut down the school.
This is unfair because we have parents to testify if their children are kept in bad conduction as claimed by the police.
He added that the immediate past Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to see how the children were taken care, never complained.
‎He said the children only studied Quran and nothing else.
But the Police Command Public Relations Officer, Yakubu Sabo, said the children would be reunited with their parents after handing them over to the state government.
"They were kept in dehumanising condition in the name of undergoing or acquiring Quranic knowledge.
With many of them with scars on their back which show they were beaten.
So, we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility," he said.
Foreign talent important to China's development
Guangdong has been leading the country in terms of attracting foreign talent, due in a large part to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and Shenzhen's new role as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group has interviewed seven expatriates aged from 10-70 in Guangdong.
Born in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, Yash from Singapore said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientific doctor in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student of Shenzhen MSU-BIT University said, "With the BRI, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
We can make new ideas and businesses together.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the US started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over one million fans on Bilibili and Weibo.
She said she will keep sharing Chinese traditions, culture and technology through her videos.
Leticia de Lassus from France, the head of JJB International Montessori AMI Centers in Guangzhou, agrees that "children's education is like buttoning up one's jacket.
If the first button is fastened incorrectly, the rest will never find their rightful place.
Chinese-American Henry Xiao believes that at the heart of GBA, his company can enjoy multiple benefits in terms of new policies, government policies and capitals, especially the talent.
Nanta Show producer Sean Choi from South Korea said Guangdong cuisine is famous all over the world, and it has been good to introduce the Nanta Show to Guangdong.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland, the technical quality director at the Pearl River Pianos, thinks the secret of high quality lies in simple work done well.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China enjoy working, learn to make good products and persist in their drive to be better.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Blonska will be next president
I think that Donald Tusk and Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska stand a chance to win the presidential election against President Andrzej Duda, says Tomasz Siemioniak.
Deputy leader of Civic Platform was interviewed by Polsat News about the affair including the head of the Supreme Audit Office.
This matter makes Marian Banas stand on the losing side.
He may become culture minister to deal with some kind of entertainment, but not the Head of the Supreme Audit Office or finance minister.
He shouldn't be the one in charge of billions and taxes, he said.
This is a very severe state crisis, he added.
Siemioniak also elaborated about Klaudia Jachira's run for election.
Law and Justice has Antoni Macierewicz on its election lists.
This is a person who not only said some things, but also did them.
He accused former Military Counter-intelligence Service bosses of espionage on behalf of Russia, he destroyed their life and their families.
Why nobody insists that Antoni Macierewicz is out of election, he asked.
Those younger than us have a different sense of taste.
I think that Jachira who already apologized for one of the things feels that she may exaggerate sometimes.
For me, it is not an election campaign problem, he added.
Tourists Return to Poland as Scheduled Following the Bankruptcy of Neckermann Poland Travel Agency
According to the office, it has not been necessary to bring the tourists to Poland prematurely so far.
It was declared that "the office has been paying any unpaid hotel nights using the insurance guarantee gradually".
On 25 September Neckermann Poland Travel Agency filed a statement of insolvency in the Marshall Office.
At the time when the Agency submitted the statement of insolvency, there were 3,600 tourists abroad.
On Wednesday, the group of ca. 500 people came back to Poland, and on Thursday a group of 230.
On Friday, subsequent 350 people are to come back from Morocco, Spain and Greece.
The tourists will land in Katowice and Warsaw (there will be five chartered flights altogether).
Some of them will come by commercial flights.
It is planned ca. 1,000 tourists staying on holiday e.g. in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy should come back home on the weekend.
According to the Marshall Office of the Voivodeship of Mazovia, the Travel Agency sold ca. 20 thousand trips for autumn and winter.
"Those travel agency customers should contact the insurer directly, meaning Allianz Partners", the office reminded.
It added also that "the situation of tourists who signalled any problems in the hotels seems stabilised for the time being and any emerging incidents of tourists expelled from hotels were patched up together with the consular services."
Last Friday the authorities of the largest and also the oldest travel agency Thomas Cook informed it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH was the owner of 100 percent of shares in Neckermann Poland.
'Hideous' Central Coast camouflage child rapist ordered to look at victim in court
Dressed in a leafy Ghillie camouflage suit, the man grabbed the then 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into bushland as she made her way to school on the state's Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the grooming and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife.
When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.
The man told the girl: "Shhh, don't scream.
Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lashing her to the tree and abusing her for almost an hour.
After he cut her loose, the girl ran crying hysterically to school.
The man arrived at work about 9.30am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues.
With dirt, grass and tree matter on his clothes, he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday.
Pope warns tech execs to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.
Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.
The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.
In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor.
But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.
"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned.
If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants' expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.
Martin Odegaard, Real Madrid Loanee, Sends Fans Wild With Mind-Boggling Assist.
Martin Odegaard provided a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener.
Real Madrid went top of the La Liga table following their 2-0 win over Osasuna as they continued their unbeaten run in this year's domestic season.
However, despite not losing a single game in La Liga this season, manager Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure following a tumultuous pre-season and a public rift with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The pressure seemed to reach the boiling point when Real Madrid were humiliated by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG) in the Champions League.
But Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have some real talent on their books, some who are currently in the Frenchman's plans and those that aren't.
Vinícius Junior is one such star for the future for Real Madrid and is currently with the team.
However, another Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard, who has been loaned out to Real Sociedad, is creating a flutter after providing a mind-boggling assist during a La Liga match.
Playing for Real Sociedad vs Alaves, Martin Odegaard provided a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener as Real Sociedad ran out 3-0 winners at home.
After picking the ball up on the right, Martin Odegaard drifted away from one opponent by nutmegging him and then threaded a stunning pass inside two more for his teammate to get at the of the inch-perfect through-ball and poke home.
Willian Jose's second and a third from the impressive Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty spot, secured a convincing win for Imanol's side, before Alaves midfielder Manu Garcia was sent off with five minutes to play.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid aged just 16 in 2015 but has struggled to live up to the hype.
Now 20, the Norwegian youngster finally appears to be finding his feet.
Anna Hazare Surprised Sharad Pawar's Name Figures In Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Scam Case
Anna Hazare said "Sharad Pawar's name was not on the list when this case came to me"
Social activist Anna Hazare has expressed surprise over Nationalist Congress Party or NCP chief Sharad Pawar's name cropping up in the multi-crore Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank scam.
Probe agency Enforcement Directorate or ED has filed a money laundering case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar - a former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra - and others in connection with the scam.
An Enforcement Case Information Report, equivalent to a police FIR, has been registered by the central agency under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on a Mumbai Police FIR which had named former chairmen of the bank, Ajit Pawar, and 70 erstwhile functionaries of the cooperative lender.
When this case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was not there anywhere.
How did his name crop up, who mentioned his name, all these things only they know," Anna Hazare said on Thursday when asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged links to the scam.
Anna Hazare, a Sharad Pawar critic, expressed the hope that the truth will come out after the ED carries out a detailed investigation in the scam.
"The ED will come to know how his name figured in the case," said Anna Hazare, a veteran of many anti-corruption agitations.
Sharad Pawar has denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was not associated with the bank in any capacity and questioned the timing of the registration of the case which comes just weeks ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls in Maharashtra.
The former Union minister has asserted he would not bow before the "throne" of Delhi, apparently referring to the BJP-led government at the Centre.
The NCP has termed the Enforcement Directorate case as politically motivated.
A busy day for Polish Border Guards.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to take stolen goods, whose value exceeded PLN 130 thousand, to Ukraine.
All events were reported yesterday (26 September) on route from Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen was carrying a Specialized e-bike.
The Polish Border Guards officers, determining the item's legality of origin, contacted representatives of German Police and quickly established that this modern single-track vehicle, worth about PLN 10 thousand, was stolen from their territory.
A few hours later, also in Korczowa, the Border Guards, while checking a semi-trailer registered in France, found that the VIN number was altered.
The driver of the combination truck was a citizen of Ukraine.
The semi-trailer, worth about PLN 30 thousand, was confiscated and will be submitted to detailed expertise in order to establish its original data.
At the crossing point in Medyka, Border Guard officers thwarted an attempt to take another stolen Can-am quad bike (year of manufacture: 2019).
The value of the vehicle, transported on a car hauler, is estimated at PLN 75 thousand.
The driver of the combination truck was a 32-year-old citizen of Ukraine.
The Border Guards confirmed that just two weeks ago a quad bike was reported missing in Poland and was sought-after all over Europe.
In Medyka, a "partial" attempt to take a stolen vehicle across the border was also thwarted.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian bus traveller was transporting car body elements coming from an exclusive Mercedes.
All car identification numbers had been mechanically removed.
The car body elements, worth about PLN 15 thousand, were confiscated.
South Africa: Man, 20, Charged With Murder of Ukzn Student Sinethemba Ndlovu
A man who was arrested in connection with the murder of University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) student Sinethemba Ndlovu is expected to apply for bail next week, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).
The accused appeared in the Msinga Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.
KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara told News24 that the case was postponed to October 2 for the bail application.
She added that the State would oppose the accused's release on bail.
According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the 20-year-old accused was arrested on Monday.
Ndlovu was stabbed below her left armpit and stomach, police said earlier this week.
It's believed that she worked as a hostess at the Msinga Driftkhana motorsport event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued that day, organisers of the motorsport event said preliminary reports suggested that a few hostesses remained behind after the event to watch some of the musical performances after their shift ended.
On their way, sadly, one of them was attacked by unknown men and later passed [a]way in hospital," their statement read.
UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, saying "the circumstances of Ndlovu's death requires us as a community to pause and reflect on the fragility of life, and the brutality that often exists in our society."
Mylan agrees to pay $30M in EpiPen settlement
Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million in a settlement tied to its failure to tell investors about a Justice Department investigation into whether the company overcharged Medicaid for the EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that Mylan NV classified the EpiPen as a "generic" drug under the Medicaid drug rebate program.
This led to the pharmaceutical company paying much lower rebates to the government than if the EpiPen had been classified as a "branded" drug.
Mylan had disclosed in July that it had reached an agreement-in-principle with the SEC on the matter.
The company said in a statement Friday that it neither admits nor denies the SEC's allegations.
Is it divine retribution?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, serious illness, death of a child.
These are tragedies that cause a great deal of suffering and are hard to understand.
We ask: "Why?".
We sometimes hear "that was God's will".
Is it the Creator who sends us all woes and diseases?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life.
When Nick Vujicic was coming into the world 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the labour room in fear.
"My son doesn't have arms or legs," he screamed to the doctor.
The parents didn't know that their child suffered from an incurable illness that made him limbless.
Initially, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months, Nick's mom felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Now, Vujicic is a world-renowned evangelist and motivational speaker, thanks to whom many people have converted.
"I am proof that God never makes mistakes," Nick emphasises.
"When we are gripped by suffering, it is hard to understand it.
We look for reasons.
We ask: «Why has it happened to us?»
If we believe that God reigns over the whole world and is in control of our lives, it is natural that we ask whether He sent us illness, misfortune..."
Mother pleads guilty to murdering two teenage sons
A woman broke down in tears as she was told she could spend the rest of her life in prison after admitting murdering her two teenage sons while conspiring to kill four more of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35, pleaded guilty to the murder of Tristan Barrass, 13, and Blake Barrass, 14.
The brothers died in hospital 12 minutes apart after police were called to the Shiregreen area of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, at about 7.30am on 24 May.
Postmortems have been carried out but the results were not given during a hearing on Friday at Sheffield crown court.
The exact circumstances surrounding the boys' deaths are not yet known.
Barrass appeared in the dock alongside her co-defendant, Brandon Machin, 39, a family member.
Flanked by three security officers, they pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to murder six children.
The pair also pleaded guilty to five counts of attempted murder during the 20-minute hearing.
The conspiracy to murder charges relate to a period between 14 and 20 May.
Four of the attempted murder charges relate to four children, including Blake and Tristan on 23 May.
The fifth count of attempted murder took place on 24 May.
The surviving children are all under the age of 13.
The judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, told the pair: "No words of mine can ever fully reflect the enormity of what you have both done.
The crimes you have committed quite frankly speak for themselves.
The murder of two children.
The attempted murder of four children and the overarching conspiracy to murder those children.
I have little doubt that each of you will in due course be sentenced to several terms of life imprisonment."
It's a matter for the judge where a whole life order is imposed.
They will be sentenced on 12 November.
A Member of Parliament for the Civic Platform party, Krzysztof Bejza, sues Cezary Gmyza.
"With regard to the campaign of lies of the Law and Justice TV, I am filing a suit against Cezary Gmyza," a Member of Parliament for the Civic Platform party, Krzysztof Brejza, announced on Twitter.
The reason for the claim is Cezary Gmyz's statement made on the "Minęła 20" programme on channel TVP.
One of the main people managing the SokzBuraka website is Krzysztof Brejza, who has a lot of experience in organising the envy department.
"Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych are people who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda very well, and he is the person who he set up that hate profile", Gmyz said.
SokzBuraka is a website and social network profile with memes and jokes about politics.
According to Sieci magazine, Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda, a public relations person, is responsible for that profile.
"We managed to find out that since this April Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in Warsaw's City Hall in the Marketing Office," we can read in the magazine.
"Confederation" in Oława
There was a meeting held by the "Confederation" Electoral Committee at the market square in Oława.
The programme was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski, no. 5 on the list, and Halszka Bielecka, no. 9.
The announced list leader, Krzysztof Tuduj, did not arrive at the campaign rally.
The candidates mentioned many problems, from the excessive fiscalism of the state to the healthcare problems.
Another issue discussed was the economic zone which should operate for the benefit of all entrepreneurs and not favour the foreign capital.
Climate strike in Budapest – World
A few thousand of people, mostly young ones, took part in a climate strike in the capital of Hungary, Budapest, on Friday.
They called on the government to reach climate neutrality, declare a state of climate threat and to run a more environmental agenda.
Protesters marched from Clark's square at the Buda side to the Kossuth square outside the parliament on the Pest side.
The people chanted: "What do we want?
Climate protection!
When do we want it?
Now!".
Boris Johnson referred to police watchdog over friendship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now assess whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was mayor of London.
The Greater London Authority (GLA) said in a statement that the authority's monitoring officer had recorded a "conduct matter" against the Prime Minister over allegations Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him.
"A "conduct matter" exists where there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed," it said.
It does not mean that this is proved in any way.
The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated.
The issue has been referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales.
It was referred to the watchdog because Mr Johnson at the time held the post equivalent to a police and crime commissioner.
Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Ms Arcuri.
Earlier he said that he would comply with an order by the London Assembly to provide details of his links with Ms Arcuri, although he insisted they were "barking up the wrong tree."
It follows a report by The Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given £126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.
The Government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Ms Arcuri's company, Hacker House, pending a review.
It is facing embarrassing questions about the verification process carried out before awarding the money.
Digital Minister Matt Warman told the Commons that his department had done the "usual due diligence" and that the company had a British phone number.
However, numerous reports said calls to the number were directed to an office in California, where Ms Arcuri, 34, is said to now be based.
PM's friendship with businesswoman 'was open secret among staff'
The move by the GLA to refer the Prime Minister to the Independent Office for Police Conduct has met with anger from No 10.
A senior Government source said it was "a politically motivated attack" and that the timing - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - was "overtly political."
"No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night," the source said.
The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.
Earlier today, the Standard was told Mr Johnson's close friendship with the Californian entrepreneur helped by London's tourism and promotions agency was an "open secret" among its staff.
Former officials at the agency, London & Partners (L&P), recalled how Ms Arcuri was given places on foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson in his time as mayor despite her companies being regarded as "not credible" by some at the time.
Third man charged with drug counts in Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offenses in connection with rapper Mac Miller's overdose death last year.
Court documents show Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died last September of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid contributing to an epidemic that's claimed thousands of lives in the U.S.
Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed Tuesday say Pettit kept getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is accused of serving as Walter's "runner" who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of the men have been directly charged with Miller's death or have entered pleas in their cases.
Walter, who is on supervised release in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been ordered to serve five months in prison for violating the terms of his release.
Prosecutors handling the case, which was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ, are asking that Walter remain in custody while he awaits trial, calling him a serious flight risk.
A phone message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.
Pettit was charged in federal court on Sept. 4, and his attorney has declined to comment.
Miller's rhymes included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.
The Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick was also in a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018.
After his death, she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, "Thank U Next," that lovingly mentioned him.
Miller is among the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016 and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.
This story has been corrected to show that Walter's first name is spelled Stephen, not Steven.
9 year old Nigerian builds more than 30 mobile games
The 9-year-old is building a hide and seek game, using a free programming application called Scratch 2.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has used it to generate more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game involves a bat he has programmed to hide.
The player gets a point every time he catches the bat when it emerges from its hiding place.
I learned how to build games at a boot camp.
"Now, I build to keep me busy when I am bored," Basil told CNN.
In March, his father signed him up for a five-day boot camp for children aged 5 to 15.
The camp, organized by Codefest International, was put in place to give children like Basil access to emerging technologies like robotics and virtual reality.
Growing up, Basil used to play a lot of mobile games says his father, Basil Okpara Sr.
"I bought him a tablet when he was 4 years old because I saw that he was always grabbing phones to play games with.
He played Candy Crush and Temple Run a lot," the father told CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating his games grew at age 7 after he got scolded for spending all of his time playing.
"There was this day he was on the tablet, as usual, he was so carried away with the game he was playing that I got upset with him," his father said.
Out of annoyance, I said to him, 'you are always playing games, can't you think about building your own games so others can play yours too?'.
I was angry when I said it, and I did not know he took it seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil actively showed interest in learning how to make his own games, prompting his parents to buy him a laptop and register him to learn the first steps of building games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, titles his games based on what they are about.
One of his games, 'Mosquito mash' is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest youth population in the world, and like Basil, this population is taking the lead when it comes to innovation on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently celebrated for using codes to build robots to sort out their house chores.
In May, team Acrobot, a Ghanaian all-girls high school team won the 2019 Robofest competition by programming robots to stack boxes.
And with Africa experiencing increased investment from tech giants like Google and Microsoft, Basil and his peers are on their way to becoming future coding stars.
Former North Carolina GOP Chair To Plead Guilty For Lying In Bribery Probe
A former North Carolina GOP chairman will admit in court that he lied to federal agents conducting a bribery investigation of a major political donor, according to court documents filed Friday.
The federal court docket shows that Robin Hayes is scheduled to enter a guilty plea next Wednesday.
A factual basis document prepared as part of the plea agreement and signed by Hayes' attorney said that Hayes knew he was making false statements to FBI agents conducting the bribery probe in 2018.
The actual plea agreement is sealed, and the factual basis doesn't specify which charges he'll plead guilty to.
He was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and making false statements.
Prosecutors have accused Hayes, a former congressman, of involvement in an insurance executive's plan to funnel campaign contributions to the state's top insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
The executive, Greg Lindberg, and two of his associates have been charged with attempting to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is an insurance and investment firm founder who has been among the state's top political donors in recent years, giving more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He favored Republican causes and politicians, but also gave to Democrats.
His attorney did not respond to an email seeking comment Friday.
A defense attorney for Hayes, Kearns Davis, didn't respond to an email Friday seeking further comment.
The court documents filed Friday state that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had never had conversations with Causey about staff at the state Department of Insurance.
But Hayes had in fact spoken to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make personnel changes within the regulator's agency, according to the factual basis document.
Prosecutors have said that Hayes also helped Lindberg request a meeting with Causey and that Hayes discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.
An indictment unsealed in April alleges that Lindberg wanted special treatment for his insurance businesses and planned to funnel up to $2 million for Causey's 2020 reelection campaign.
The scheme involved a request to replace a department official who had been examining a Lindberg company, according to the indictment.
Causey, a Republican, reported the alleged attempted bribe to federal investigators and helped them build their case.
He faces no charges.
The indictment states that an associate of Lindberg's directed Hayes to transfer $250,000 to Causey's reelection campaign during a conversation that also included Lindberg and Causey.
Hayes initially protested, saying that moving so much money would draw attention, but eventually relented during the conversation, according to the indictment.
"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Alright, I'll get "er done."
A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office didn't respond to an email seeking further information about the plea agreement.
Drivers to Go Along the First Section of the New Zakopianka
From Saturday, the drivers will be able to use the first out of three constructed mountain sections of the S7 express road, meaning the new Zakopianka, from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój, and next the main fast traffic dual-carriageway road to Chabówka.
As reported by the spokeswoman of the Krakow branch of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), Iwona Mikrut, on Friday, it is the first out of three sections of the constructed S7 route south of Krakow, from Lubień to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into use.
In the section more than 6 km long from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka, more than one third, i.e.
ca. 2.3 km, was led on bridges.
There are seventeen of them, including the longest and highest one, one kilometre long and 50 m high, as well as four small structures over the watercourses at Skomielna interchange.
From this interchange, there are exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, road no. 28 and to the former course of DK7, provided.
From the following interchange, Zabornia, you can change to DK47 towards Nowy Targ and Zakopane and to DK7 to Chyżne and the Poland-Slovakia border.
There was a passenger service area created on Zbójecka Góra.
The express road ends with Zabornia interchange in Rabka Zdrój, with an about one-kilometre dual-carriageway section of DK47 to Chabówka added, where it is connected to the existing dual-carriageway road connecting Chabówka and Rdzawka.
The S7 section Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój and the new section of the national fast traffic (GP) road no. 47 from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was constructed by Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The project cost was ca. PLN 615 million.
The Defects Liability for the works performed will be valid for 10 years.
The section of the new Zakopianka of ca. 16.7 km, including 15.8 km with the express road parameters, was divided into three implementation parts, each with its separate contractor: Lubień – Naprawa, Naprawa – Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first section from the entrance to the tunnel is made by the Polish-Ukrainian consortium of IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING from Kiev, the tunnel section by Italian Astaldi, and the third by the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of those tasks is close to PLN 2.5 billion.
The project is co-funded from the European Union Funds within the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014–2020.
The funding amounts to more than PLN 1.3 billion.
Along the entire section, there are 38 road structures created (bridges, overbridges, long bridges) and a two-chamber tunnel 2.06 km long.
According to the statement of the road administrator, the 7.6 km long section from Lubień to Naprawa will be put into use this year, with a temporary connection to the old DK7 road which will be used by drivers to bypass the tunnel construction site.
The last section Naprawa – Skomielna Biała 3 km long will be used by drivers in 2021, after the two-chamber tunnel construction is completed, with every carriageway ca. 2.06 km long.
Our goal is a welfare state
"We are building a welfare state in Poland", announced the Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to persuade constituents to vote for a councillor, Dariusz Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the Law and Justice's list.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish version of a prosperity state strategy," the Minister said.
"We want Poles to earn much more money so that their lives will be on a much higher level.
This is a must, because otherwise young, high-achieving, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot allow that.
Our administration, for four years, has consistently implemented the programme we obliged to carry out four years ago.
We said we would launch the 500 plus programme.
The Civic Platform party, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopacz said it would not be possible, that this money does not exist.
We proved that we have and had the money, only the Civic Platform did not take care of those to whom the money was supposed to go.
Ziobro also reminded voters about school starter kits and the thirteenth pension – and that there are plans for a fourteenth pension.
In addition to "prudent division of national income", the Law and Justice priorities are: just state and economic development.
"The money should not go in big streams only into the pockets of the chosen ones, who have good relations with the Establishment and Authorities, but should be evenly distributed among the whole of society", the politician said.

Section of Sopocka street in Nisko already rebuilt
On Tuesday, 24th September, the Sopocka street in Nisko was officially opened for traffic.
The total costs of the works amounted to PLN 1 million 803 thousands, among which PLN 1 million 26 thousands were financed from FDS and the remaining amount is the financial contribution of the Nisko District as well as the Nisko Commune and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the financial resources, the road surface of 1284 metres length was laid and extended. The works included also the pavement of 950 metres length, dewatering as well as finishing works.
The investment was realized by the following companies: PBI Infrastruktura S.A. from Krasnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. from Sandomierz.

Facebook to hide number of likes in trial aimed at improving users' wellbeing
Some Facebook users will soon no longer see the number of likes, reactions and video views on other's posts in a world-first trial aimed at boosting users' wellbeing.
Instead, likes will be private and only visible to the post's author in a change that follows a similar test on Instagram which started in July in Australia.
The new Facebook trial, which begins on Friday, will also kick off in Australia.
Facebook Australia's director of policy Mia Garlick said the change was based on wellbeing research and feedback from mental health professionals that the number of likes can cause social comparison.
"We've had really positive feedback from a lot of the anti-bullying groups and mental health organisations that we work with," Garlick said.
It really is just taking that number out of the equation, so that people can focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.
It's hoped that people will be more comfortable with sharing on the platform rather than feeling like it's a competition, she said.
Garlick assured businesses who rely on Facebook they will still receive all the same metrics and insights they previously accessed.
She said it was too early to say if the test would roll out to other countries like Instagram's trial has in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication of when the trial will end or if the change will be made permanent.
"We have had some initial positive feedback from the public about the experience [on Instagram], but we're still just learning and listening to feedback at this stage," she said.
On being the world's training ground Garlick said Australia has very active "tech-savvy" users of Facebook and Instagram.
We think this is a great country where we can get some really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people on our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims from the Curia
The Curia of Częstochowa has not yet commented on the councillors' appeal to the local metropolitan Archbishop Wacław Depo on providing financial compensation for the management of the waste disposal during pilgrimage season.
The city requests PLN 1 from every pilgrim.
The Vice-Chairperson of the Częstochowa City Council and candidate for the Sejm, Łukasz Kot, spoke about the speech addressed to the metropolitan archbishop during a press conference, in which a leader of the Spring party, Robert Biedroń, took part, held on Friday on Holy Virgin Mary Avenue leading up to the Jasna Góra Monastery.
Kot announced that the day before that local councillors from the Democratic Left Alliance party passed the appeal to archbishop Wacław Depo on passing on to the city one PLN from each pilgrim visiting Częstochowa to support the work of municipal services.
We adopted the appeal to the Archbishop Depo so he would help the city, help us clean up after the pilgrims, and prepare for pilgrims.
"We ask that a symbolic one zloty from every pilgrim be transferred to the city budget.
Thanks to that, the city can provide them with better conditions of stay in Częstochowa", said the Vice-Chairperson of the City Council.
When asked for comment, the Metropolitan Curia of Częstochowa's spokesman, priest Mariusz Bakalarz, at first provided a longer response, then, however, he asked – as he indicated, on behalf of Archbishop Depo – to replace it with the following information: "We will not refer to that matter until the City Council takes an official position on this issue."
According to the project published on the websites of the Częstochowa City Council, the appeal to the Archbishop Depo refers to "transferring financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for maintaining the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season.
"With regard to the growing number of pilgrims coming to Częstochowa and increasing cost of maintaining the municipal waste management system in pilgrimage season, taking into consideration the image of the city among its inhabitants and pilgrims, as a part of generally accepted canons of caring for our common good, our little homeland Częstochowa, we would like to propose the Curia's participation in the costs of maintaining the above-mentioned waste management system," states a fragment of the appeal.
"Striving to maintain the cleanliness of areas for pedestrian and motor traffic used by pilgrims, who, at the same time, make use of small infrastructure, i.e. outdoor waste bins, we will introduce symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system amounting to PLN 1 from each pilgrim", the appeal continues.
"What is more, in relation to the participation in annual costs, which will be covered by the city's own resources, taking care of cleanliness and aesthetics of the urban space, but also with emphasis that this cooperation will bring benefits to all the involved parties, we declare that 20% from the above-mentioned amount will be allocated to the tourist infrastructure improvement, for instance for building more toilets available to the public," the councillors stated.
They also highlighted that besides financial matters, their proposal results from the numerous reservations from inhabitants about the cleanliness of routes used by pilgrims.
"Taking into account the cleanliness of our city and the potential positive effects of cooperation, the Częstochowa City Council calls on Wacław Depo, the metropolitan archbishop of Częstochowa, to transfer financial compensation to Częstochowa for the maintenance of municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," they repeated in the appeal.
According to the information from the Jasna Góra press office, over the course of the last year, 834 thousand people joined 200 nationwide pilgrimages in Poland to the shrine.
About 124 thousand believers took part in 255 walking pilgrimages.
More than 8,8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) in running pilgrimages.
Nearly 20 people reached the shrine on horseback, and more than 170 pilgrimages in two groups on rollerblades.
TVP "Wiadomości" ignored Confederation while describing the opinion poll
According to a survey performed by Pollster, in elections to the Sejm, Law and Justice would obtain 45% votes, Civic Coalition 26%, The Left 14%, PSL 7% and Confederation 5% votes.
Even the "Super Express", web portal the survey was performed for, reported exceeding the electoral threshold.
In the prime time "Wiadomości" edition describing the survey, the results for only four parties were presented, completely ignoring Confederation.
The presenter Edyta Lewandowska clearly emphasised that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
TVP viewers were also presented a division of seats in the Sejm without the votes given to Confederation..
It would provide Law and Justice with independent rule.
Krzysztof Bosak in his comment to the whole situation described it as "public disgrace in terms of honesty towards society".
"They started from slogans about «moral revolution», he recalled and said that the case was the sign of weakness.
By contrast, Robert Winnicki on Twitter wrote that "TVP Wiadomości" in subsequent steps against Confederation put Urban and Michnik to shame.
He also emphasised the lack of response of right-wing journalists.
"We let’s also look at those who are permissively silent.
Those «honest», «independent», «disobedient» ones.
Within a few years they became a primitive version of the whole thing they had been seemingly fighting against.

Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing
Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."
Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.
"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.
In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.
But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.
Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.
The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.

Lawlessness double displaced from NW Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
Worsening violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwest Nigeria to some 40,000 over the past four months, the United Nations said on Friday.
The UN's refugee agency said the turmoil had created a "new humanitarian emergency" that would require a fresh inter-agency fundraising effort of $35.5 million by the end of the year.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said Boko Haram, the Islamist group that has waged a decade-long insurgency in the north of the country, was not responsible for the latest attacks.
Rather, the upsurge of violence in the past 10 months in Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina states in Nigeria was the work of organized armed groups.
"It paints a horrible picture of lawlessness and insecurity," he told journalists on Friday.
He said there were frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder and sexual violence by attackers who also destroy homes and steal property.
Military and police have been deployed to tackle criminal gangs in the region.
But the military is stretched from fights against Boko Haram and Islamic State's West Africa branch, which split from the former group in 2016.
"The refugees are not coming with names of groups," he said.
What they are coming with are horrific accounts.
Those fleeing are mostly crossing into neighboring Niger.
In a statement, the UNHCR said it expected more to flee to Niger in the coming months as the security situation, particularly in Sokoto state, deteriorates.
New trial date set for man accused of killing woman, 2 kids
A new trial date has been scheduled for a Guatemala man accused of killing an Iowa woman and her two children.
Polk County District Court records say 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is charged with three counts of first-degree murder under what authorities say was a false name he initially gave to police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He's pleaded not guilty.
Police say he fatally shot 29-year-old Rossibeth Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on July 16 in a Des Moines home.
Court records show the new trial date of Jan. 27 will give attorneys for both sides more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and had twice been deported before the shooting.
He was convicted in 2010 of illegal entry into the U.S.
Boris Johnson faces Cabinet revolt to lower Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with Brussels - The Sun
With just three weeks to go until a showdown EU leaders' summit, fears are growing around the PM's top table that he is running out of time to win major concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU.
Negotiators are deadlocked over a new customs system to replace the Irish backstop, with Brussels branding Mr Johnson's alternative arrangements proposals as "unworkable."
Senior ministers expect EU power brokers - led by Germany's Angela Merkel - to offer the embattled Tory leader a last minute compromise, such as a three year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun has spoken to three different Cabinet ministers, who are all preparing to confront him after the Tories" annual conference in Manchester next week.
They will demand he abandons the "aggressive" strategy devised by senior aide Dominic Cummings to try to bluff the EU with the threat of No Deal, and insist he accepts the EU's last minute offer.
One Cabinet minister dubbed the crushing Supreme Court verdict to end Parliament's suspension on Tuesday as "a wake-up call," adding: "A deal is the only way we can leave on October 31 now.
We're never going to beat the numbers in the Commons, and they are against us.
The PM has to lean in now and take what he can get.
Being aggressive doesn't work, the Cummings plan has clearly failed.
We just can't fight battles on so many fronts.
A second Cabinet minister has vowed to tell Mr Johnson to try to push through ex-PM Theresa May's deal if all else fails.
That senior minister added: "I will tell Boris to put Theresa's deal back to the Commons if I have to."
The numbers are there for it now, everyone is desperate to end this.
It's all over for Boris and it's all over for all of us if we're forced to extend.
Sir John Major accused Boris of not taking the negotiation seriously.
In a withering speech, the former Tory premier said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe.
But we don't see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.
Instead, we do see him wrestling with bulls in Scotland; inspecting eggs in Wales; and arguing with the public in high streets - for all the world as if an election campaign was already in full swing."
The PM's spokesman yesterday admitted a deal was still far off, saying: "No one should be under any illusion - there is a very long way to go if we are to secure a deal."
But the spokesman also said the Benn Act to enforce a three months delay if there is no deal was "actively undermining our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that it has hindered our negotiating position but the Prime Minister and colleagues through hard work have continued to try and make progress in the face of that piece of legislation."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay goes back to Brussels today for more talks with the EU's Michel Barnier.
They will discuss a paper on how an all-Ireland zone on food and livestock would work.
Noseless and legless dog conquers Instagram .
Perfectly imperfect
The mongrel was supposed to be put down.
However, it has been successfully prevented.
The little bitch was transferred from Romania to the UK by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love at first sight with the animal.
"In the beginning I found it difficult to convince my husband to adopt her, because we already had three dogs", she said.
The woman made a decision to take care of the bitch until somebody adopts her.
However, there was still nobody to pick her up.
"The fact that nobody wanted to take care of her made me more and more eager to look after her.
She was sensitive and needed love", communicated Kate.
Finally, the married couple decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if somebody does not like the way she looks, that’s their problem, not ours", said the woman.
As time went by Bonnie became a social media star.
She has more than 14 thousand followers on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told I'd never make it in TV with a Glasgow accent
Lorraine Kelly revealed that TV bosses told her she would "never make it" as a presenter because of her Glaswegian accent.
Looking back on 35 years in broadcasting, Kelly, 59, recalled how she felt "very nervous" ahead of her first appearance on screen.
"I was only 25 and very nervous," she said.
I had been working as a researcher at BBC Scotland and been told by the big boss that I would never make it in TV because of my Glasgow accent.
I went down to London to meet all of the TV-am team and see the show being broadcast, before taking over at the Glasgow office.
I will never forget, Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the icon that is Bette Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to be.
Kelly started her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbride, Scotland before becoming a Scottish correspondent for TV-am in 1984.
She went on to host shows including GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak before launching her eponymous morning programme Lorraine.
She will mark her 35th anniversary with a special show looking back at her most memorable moments and interviews.
The presenter said that "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the secret to longevity in TV, adding: "You have to put in the work.
You have to be honest and authentic.
Do your homework and be both interested and interesting.
Looking back at the news stories that impacted her emotionally, Kelly revealed that reporting on the Dunblane massacre was "very tough."
I had no idea that many of the families whose children had been killed or wounded were watching our live show from Dunblane the day after the horrific killing of sixteen children and their teacher.
One of the mums, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked to see me privately and we ended up talking for hours at her house.
It was all under the radar, I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I have been friends ever since.
She added that interviewing Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine went missing in 2007 was "extremely hard" and said that she "really admired their strength and courage."
They have had to put up with the pain of not knowing what has happened to their beloved daughter, as well as the most appalling trolling online.
My heart goes out to them.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary show is on Monday, September 30 from 8.30am on ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga Feared Trapping
Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga turned down an offer by the late president Robert Mugabe to take over the presidency at the height of the coup as he feared it might be a trap to rubberstamp the military take-over in November 2017, a senior government official has claimed.
As reported by the Zimbabwe Independent last week, Mugabe offered Chiwenga to take over the presidency as negotiations between him and the army ensued during the coup.
However, a senior government official said on social media Chiwenga did not turn down the offer out of fear, but he was able to see through Mugabe's plan to use him to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that indeed he had been toppled in a coup.
In a Twitter thread which confirmed Zimbabwe's 37-year-ruler was willing to hand over power to Chiwenga and not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom government officials confirmed was a senior government official in the Office of the President and Cabinet, said intense negotiations were held at the time over the issue.
Government officials said Mugabe approached Chiwenga through one of his emissaries when he realised power was slipping though his hands.
Intercession between the military command element and late former president had three strands, according to the senior government official.
The official said characters involved in the negotiations included presidential spokesperson George Charamba, Central Intelligence Organisation then acting boss Aaron Nhepera and Roman Catholic Bishop cleric Fidelis Mukonori.
Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono was another strand after he was sent by Mugabe on a one-man mission with the offer of the presidency to Chiwenga who was the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander.
The man, who in death more than in life has been described as an African icon, tried in vain to get the AU to denounce the military operation, while seeking intervention by other African leaders.
Offer of presidency to then CDF (Commander Defence Forces Chiwenga) by the late (Mugabe) was not by choice.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation which had grown dangerously fast-paced; wearing down a part of the late's family," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was also a bit of political baiting which the late hoped would turn the tables, at the very least diplomatically.
Recall that commanders had declared they had not, and would not, overthrow the constitutional order, a development which would have set them on a collision with the AU position on coups.
The late (Mugabe) hoped the then CDF (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, thereby putting paid to claims by commanders they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for (the) late (Mugabe) was that the AU, which by the way was still very confused by the whole situation and how to fit it within its theoretical taxonomy on coups, would then have no option, but to describe it as a coup, in which case calls for military intervention would then have credence.
That was the spirit and calculation within which the offer was made.
Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realised that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter after the military had warned the strongman that he risked a Gadaffi-style lynching.
Military bosses told him they would not turn their guns on citizens if they marched to his Blue Roof residence.
And at that instant Mugabe had two desires, to save his family and also to prove that the military had taken over power," the official said.
The then CDF and commanders correctly read (the) calculation.
The emissary (Gono) of that desperate message was told -- through a powerful metaphor -- that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the sect of camouflages, that is, the military); we are not politicians or (in) political competition, the senior government official said.
Government officials say the army had communicated to other military bosses in the region through attachés who were in Zimbabwe that their intentions were not to topple Mugabe, but to deal with "criminals" around him.
Mugabe also tried to use the same strategy to lure Mnangagwa back from short exile in South Africa so that they could have a discussion on the coup and succession.
Apart from negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help from the region.
The South Africans, who were key to the process -- not least because of their economic and regional power, but also because the then president Jacob Zuma was the Sadc chairperson -- refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the army had invaded Mugabe's house, as they were threatening repeatedly in the background, South African troops would have arrived in Harare in no time.
"That did not work because Putin and African leaders did not prefer that route," a source told the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or will 'crumble,' policy paper says
China needs the strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party or the country will "crumble," the government said in a policy paper released on Friday ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
China's cabinet news office said in a white paper that the country's success since the Communists took power 70 years ago was down to the party's leadership.
China is huge in size, has complex national conditions, and its governance difficulties are rarely seen.
Without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move toward division and crumble, bringing disaster to the world," it said.
Chinese authorities have long justified a firm fist in dealing with problems, like the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, as being necessary for national stability.
Strong-arm President Xi Jinping, who will headline the anniversary celebrations of the world's second-biggest economy on Tuesday, has further tightened party rule and cracked down on those who may challenge authority since taking office in late 2012.
Xi has also overseen a military modernization program that has unnerved the region.
China does not seek to export its development model nor want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony," the policy paper said.
The Chinese people do not have it in their genes to invade others or dominate the world.
In modern times, China has been bullied by the Great Powers, war and turmoil have left a deep impression with the suffering caused; China will never impose the sufferings it has been through on other peoples.
China is marking the anniversary at a time of uncertainty for the country, which is locked in a bitter trade war with the United States and faces challenges from a slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.
China will never "trade away" its core interests and not allow its security and sovereignty to be compromised, the paper said.
"The threat of trade wars and the continued increase in tariffs are not conducive to solving problems," it said, in reference to its trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, broad market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never be weakened by trade wars," the paper added.
China is confident that it has the ability to face difficulties, turn crises into opportunities, and open up a new world.
The United States should look rationally at China's development, as China has no intention of challenging the United States and does not want to replace the United States, it added.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely to stop China's development.
Curbing and suppressing other countries and transferring domestic contradictions abroad will not keep the United States strong.
The world of Jacek Palkiewicz The real face of Dubai
Emirate of Dubai is a place still struggling to find its own identity, torn between the Bedouin tradition, religious Islamic radicalism as well as the extremism of modern times.
This trend-setting leader of modern tourism stimulates imagination and desires, sparks vanity of the rich ones with snobbish hotels and as a tax paradise, draws in investors and salespeople.
Websites spark intensively promote this city of dreams that combines in itself an exciting temple of luxury and an essence of the 21st century architecture.
The emirate founded on petroleum-rich sands soon became a paradise for those who love laps of luxury, five star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools lying hundreds meters above the ground.
Many people are admiring the omnipresent luxury, appreciate the creative hypreractivism and proactive struggle for creating an avant-garde atmosphere.
This is a city whose motto tells us everything: it surprises, it shocks and it enchants.
Almost at every turn.
There are, however, still a few people able to turn a critical eye on Dubai, calling it a city without a soul.
As argued by the British writer, Lawrence Osborne this metropolis, full and contrasts and contradictions, is nothing more than cheap, grotesque city.
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, fully dominated by the Guinness World Records, Emirate's unofficial constitution.
Everything here must be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
Among the jungle of extravagances and lavish luxury, it lacks something that may be not too transparent in the old Europe, but has a great influence on life quality.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid everyone feels like home.
Unlike in Dubai for sure.
Escaping the world of magic, I took off its golden mask and revealed the second face of this artificial paradise.
The face that you can hardly ever read or hear about.
I am showing the famine of Asian people contrasting with the fairytale-like life led by the divine cast of native Dubai people, the grandchildren of illiterate Bedouins.
I am discovering the jungle of extreme famine, for instance into the ghetto at the outskirts where lots of Asian workmen live in very harsh conditions.
It is them who, as slaves, within one generation's lifetime, managed to build the sky-touching Manhattan right on the desert.
They came here, attracted by good salaries, willing to help their families make a decent living, but what they experienced, is a nightmare.
Tourists will never see it, as that would destroy the myth build over the years.
Since international communities are increasingly expressing their criticism, the issue of cheap workforce is a major nuisance for the emir.
Spice Girls' Mel C bans diet talk at home after eating disorder battle
Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm has admitted diets are banned in her home after her own personal battles with eating disorders which saw her eat nothing but fruit and vegetables for years.
Sporty Spice spent years under-eating and "obsessively exercising" while dealing with the pressures of being in the globally famous pop group and she was later diagnosed with depression as well as an eating disorder.
Now she has revealed that her own experiences affect the way she raises her own daughter, Scarlet and that she doesn't "ever allow people to speak about diets in our house."
"Scarlet's 10 years old now and I'm starting to notice that she's more conscious of the way she looks," said Mel.
But I think one of the positives of having gone through having an eating disorder is that I'm very conscious of how I speak around her.
That positive language - it's habit now.
Speaking to Women's Health magazine, Mel, who shot to fame as part of the Spice Girls in the 1990s, before the rise of social media said that "disgusting" comments about her in the press led to her body issues.
"I started not looking after myself properly, cutting out food groups, and my exercising became more and more obsessive, to the point that I was underweight," she said.
I was unwell and that probably continued for a couple of years."
The photo that shocked the world
A Polish girl and an American documentalist gave the world proof of war cruelty.
The legendary photo by Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk.
"Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and I must speak on behalf of the Polish nation about what has happened here.
America must act and must help!" is how Julien Bryan, a documentalist and photographer, started his radio speech.
In the tragic days of September 1939, he was in the capital city of Poland and witnessed the drama of bombarded city and its residents.
His account has received wide attention in the West.
Initially, the Mayor of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, helped him and lent his car, but later on he asked him to leave the city immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the USA, deposited it in an embassy safe and... stayed.
Over the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever the Varsovians were.
The city was continuously attacked by 400 planes with the use of artillery.
Bryan's photographs depicted death, distress and fight for survival in the city ruins.
Just before the surrender, together with embassy employees, he smuggled negatives overseas.
He would not stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What has happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London and even New York."
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt watched his shocking footage.
Shortly after, the USA started war preparations.
"My dad showed the truth and that is how he fought against German propaganda.
They made films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they did not attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Trial of ex-athlete accused of multiple rapes goes to jury
Jury deliberations are under way in the rape trial of an ex-university of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults.
Jurors began deliberating the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway on Friday after 10 days of testimony and arguments.
A 21-year-old woman says Conaway raped her after she drove to his house in June 2018.
The encounter happened three weeks after the two connected on the online meeting site Bumble, and he sent her a nude picture of himself.
She is among six women whom Conaway is accused of sexually assaulting between 2013 and 2018.
Prosecutors say the woman objected when consensual cuddling escalated to Conway forcing himself on her.
Defense attorneys have targeted the woman's conflicting accounts and memory lapses and say she may have regretted being physically intimate.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike worth one million PLN
The gold-plated bicycle worth one million PLN was on display at the 10th jubilee edition of the BIKE-EXPO Kielce International Bicycle Trade Show.
It is a unique vehicle printed in a 3D printer.
Its designer, 30-year old Adam Zdanowicz has just received the bicycle Oscar for it at the World Exhibition of Custom Bicycles in Las Vegas.
The unique model was a big hit at the show. "The bike is covered with gold chrome spray, underlaid with silver of the highest quality.
This unique layer has been created by my friend from Żory.
"It has a saddle, pedals, handle bars – you could ride it as any other bike.
It can reach up to 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," explains its designer.
"The bike's bodywork was printed in 3D.
These are cubes creating a type of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model when I was riding my first bicycle home, a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and hid it deep in my drawer.
The drawing waited five years for execution.
The bike itself took three years to create," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was excruciatingly difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
It has batteries, cables and elements which create the structure.
All this is hidden under 11 elements of bodywork applied on the steel frame of the bike.
That is where the engine is hidden as well.
The bike's handle bars were manufactured a week before my flight to the United States for the World Bike Exhibition.
I couldn't decide what the handle bars should look like until the very end.
It can be dismantled for transportation.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he sums up.
The gold-plated bike was recognized in Las Vegas in the most important category of "The best amazing individual custom-made model".
Video reveals tourist hotspot as heavily polluted
Surrounded by the Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park and of course the iconic Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour is the major contributor to the $21.9 billion Sydney tourism pumps into Australia's economy each year.
But beneath the bridge lies an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous harbour is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, receiving around 15 Olympic-size swimming pools of pollutants each year.
This horrific statistic makes one of our greatest tourism drawcards also one of our dirtiest.
According to a new video, titled Sydney Harbour Above and Below, the waters around Australia's most popular city is filled with cigarette butts, plastic bags and bottles, lost shoes and clothing and even dead animals - all coming into the harbour from stormwater run-off.
But the biggest component choking our waterways is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," Dr Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program said in the video, which was released to coincide with World Tourism Day on September 27.
It does look beautiful, but it is one of the more modified and polluted estuaries along our coastline.
The CSIRO estimates around 1560kg of plastic enters our waterways each hour, most of it coming into the harbour through stormwater drains.
"After we have some of these really big rainfall events, the harbour ... it's quite tragic," Dr Dafforn said.
Two thirds of our pollution comes from stormwater run-off.
But like an iceberg, the problem on Sydney's harbour is far bigger below the surface, with the seabed receiving 70 per cent of plastics that enter the ocean.
"Unless you spend time under the water, I don't think you get a true appreciation of what is below there," Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly said, noting he and his team pull out around 500kg of plastic on their own each year.
I think if more people knew (what was under the water) they would just be horrified.
Overwhelmingly ... over half of everything we find is plastic bags.
The other 50 per cent is at least made out of plastic.
When you look at the harbour it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that we get all of this plastic and all of this rubbish just under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of the Ocean Protect, said there were ways people - both locals and visitors alike - could help to ease the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.
"It has to start at the source," he said.
We have to reduce the amount of plastic that we are using, recycle better and be more conscious about what is going down our drains which ultimately ends up in our oceans.
If we ruin the ocean, we are going to kill ourselves because 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30 per cent of carbon dioxide and our food source.
But we can fix this harbour and bring it back to where it was, but it's pretty simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The video, which was funded by recycling company TOMRA as part of their broader efforts to educate Australians on protecting the environment and reducing the impact of drink containers that can often end up in nature, coincides with a study about plastic and mental health that was also released this month.
A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found 82 per cent felt hopeless about plastic waste and 25 per cent blamed adults for the single-use plastic waste problem.
The study revealed plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern for parents, with 93 per cent of 551 parents surveyed saying they are increasingly worried about the level of plastic waste entering the oceans.
Many who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste but just didn't know how to make a difference, which was leading to eco-anxiety.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after the volleyball match in the semi-final of the European Championship
That was not an easy match.
The Slovenes had a lively audience on their side that was very effective in distracting Polish volleyball players.
There were also many controversies about referees who during one move did not recognise four hits on the side of home team.
It happened at the crucial moment of the first set when Vital Heynen’s pupils had a chance to jump away from rivals and win the first game.
However, it did not happen, and Poles finally were forced to recognise the superiority of their rival who after winning 3:1 would play in the tournament final.
Ghana: Kaneshie Traders Support Accra Psychiatric Hospital
Members of the Kaneshie Market Association, yesterday donated food items worth GH¢ 30,000 to the Accra Psychiatric Hospital, at a short ceremony in Accra.
It forms part of activities marking the 40th anniversary celebration of the Kaneshie Markets Complex.
The donation included assorted foods, fruits, soft drinks, biscuits, clothing, yam, plantain, cassava, as well as bags of water among others.
The group also interacted with some of the patients at the facility as part of their visit.
In attendance was some management staff of the Accra Markets Limited, executives of the association as well as some queen mothers.
Presenting the items, Madam Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, president of the Greater Accra Regional Market Women Association, said the donation was part of the group's regular charity activities in fulfilment of its corporate social responsibility.
She noted that there was the need to support the caretaking of patients at the facility to make them feel loved and part of society.
Madam Needjan, pledged the association's support to the hospital and called on other associations to emulate the gesture.
Receiving the items, Dr Pinnaman Appau, director at the hospital, lauded the association for the support and promised that they would be put to good use to the benefit of the patients.
She appealed to other organisations to also support the hospital.
Google to create a cloud in Poland.
Partnership with PKO BP
Operator Chmury Krajowej, PKO BP and PFR entered into strategic partnership with Google.
The aim of this cooperation is to help Polish companies incorporate the cloud computing technology and to make full use of it.
The Google Cloud Platform products will become an integral part of the Operator Chmury Krajowej offer and Google is to open the so called Google Cloud region in Warsaw, i.e. a technical infrastructure and software centre for the customers from Poland and East-Central Europe.
Google Cloud Region will be the first realization of the global, public cloud computing in Central Europe.
Digitalization of Polish companies was one of the key aims of the Chmura Krajowa project, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and Polski Fundusz Rozwoju, the stakeholders of this company.
The partnership of the Chmura Krajowa and Google marks another vital milestone on the path that we started walking almost one year ago when we announced establishing Operator Chmury Krajowej.
The aim still remains the same: we wish to facilitate the digitalization of Polish economy and make it grow even faster.
Polish companies will now get additional, sophisticated tools to achieve that target.
Using them, they will stand better chances to rank among world's best countries, which is a dream for all of us.
The fact that Google decides to join our project today is an added value to our common project, says Zbigniew Jagiello, CEO of PKO Bank Polski.
Polski Fundusz Rozwoju emphasizes that they are interested in investment projects supporting the development of modern industries as well as companies.
Investing money in Operator Chmury Krajowej is a vital element of PFR's strategy and an important step towards digitalization of the country.
Companies will be provided with modern, affordable solutions based on the cloud systems.
I strongly believe that this cooperation will positively influence the Polish IT industry, attracting the best specialists, says Pawel Borys, PFR's CEO.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on the cutting-edge technology infrastructure providing computing power and data storage services.
Polish customers can find all Google Cloud Platform key products, such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or Big Query.
Thanks to the fact that the Google Cloud Services will be incorporated into the Chmura Krajowa offer, Polish companies will be able to use exactly the same advanced technologies their global competitors use.
Thanks to us it will, however, remain within the Polish jurisdiction and local administrators will have control over it, emphasizes Michal Potoczek, CEO of Operator Chmury Krajowej.
He adds that the company will be ready for great trends, such as e.g. Internet of Things (IoT), which makes the demand for computation power needed to compute great data collections increasingly bigger.
VI Polish Parade of Seniors
On 24 August 2019 at noon, at Charles de Gaulle Roundabout in Warsaw, the VI Parade of Seniors called "Great and Mature" and the Generations' Picnic, the events organised by Zaczyn Foundation, started.
According to Przemysław Wiśniewski from the Foundation, "The parade is unique globally.
It marched through the centre of Warsaw for the sixth time to manifest the seniors are large and versatile community.
Through the Parade, we counteract harmful stereotypes affecting seniors and call for inter-generation solidarity."
The parade was led by a special double-decker making a mobile music stage where famous Warsaw singer, DJ Wika, performed as usual.
The participants marched in a joyful procession along Aleje Jerozolimskie, Krucza Street, to the Powstańców Warszawy Square, Mazowiecka Street to Józef Piłsudski Square, as well as Królewska Street and Krakowskie Przedmieście to the Main Campus of the University of Warsaw, to the sounds of famous Warsaw and global hits.
During the parade, with several thousand senior participants, representing 300 senior organisations from different parts of Poland, colourful delegations were applauded by the residents of Warsaw and visitors along the parade route.
Parade participants included e.g. two organised groups from Legionowo, dressed in uniform yellow and blue T-shirts.
The first of them represented the University of the Third Age and Senior+ Club and the other was called SAGA for the Senior Active Animator Group.
In the university Campus, the organisers prepared e.g. catering stands and many stands of institutions and companies offering services and products to seniors to improve their everyday life and function.
This included medical, cosmetic, cooking, recreation, sports and fashion stands.
For example, in the stand of Stylowi Seniorzy Głosu Seniora, professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrwał provided guidelines and information on the current trends in 60+ fashion.
What is more, the stand offered workshops devoted to moving on the stage and posing for pictures.
The crown was the fashion show by Stylowi Seniorzy.
In the stand of Ogólnopolski Głos Seniora, there was the latest edition of this magazine and materials concerning the campaign called "Stop Manipulations – Do not Buy During Presentations".
Other stands offered cosmetic, gymnastic, art and artistic workshops.
In some of them, it was possible to undergo examinations and consult health and nutrition specialists.
There were also discussion panels held with e.g. Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadla, Mariola Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow or Robert Janowski.
During the picnic, there were also many singing and music attractions.
The iconic Polish singer, Krzysztof Krawczyk, performed on stage and in the evening there was an inter-generation dancing party led by DJ Wika.

Tasmanian devils may hold the key to curing cancer - as researchers find a breakthrough which could revolutionise treatment for sufferers
Medical researchers found how some cancer cells can camouflage themselves
Researchers found the same process happens in Tasmanian Devils and humans
The discovery is hoped to provide new methods to treat cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can turn invisible.
Researchers, including from Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, have found a breakthrough which could help revolutionise treatment for some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also hold the key to tackling deadly facial tumours threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study tracked the way some cancer cells in both humans and the marsupial camouflage themselves using a group of proteins known as PRC2, switching off a marker which would otherwise alert the immune system to attack the cancer.
This can be a major challenge in treating small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and a type of skin cancer known as Merkel cell.
'The huge significance from this project is that (in) patients who sometimes become resistant to immunotherapies, we might be able to reverse that process,' lead Peter Mac researcher Mark Dawson told AAP.
Existing treatments could be repurposed to switch back on the markers, proteins known as MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise the cancer cells.
'Potentially, this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,' Prof Dawson said.
'It's one of the most prevalent diseases across the globe.
And we may be able to treat this in a far better way.
Researchers also hope the discovery could eventually be used against Tasmanian devil facial tumours, where cancer cells avoid detection in the same way.
'Remarkably, exactly the same process happens (in human and Tasmanian devil cancers),' Prof Dawson said.
'Thus far it's been very difficult to treat the Tasmanian devil tumours.
But if the drugs that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this may help with the control of the disease.'
Scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star
Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-years away from Earth that defies current understanding about planet formation, with a large Jupiter-like planet orbiting a diminutive star known as a red dwarf.
An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.
Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them.
But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.
"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.
The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes.
In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures.
GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately.
This is why they have a reddish color," Morales said.
There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.
Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit.
Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.
A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said.
This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear.
These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet.
Deli Worker Accused Of Giving Meth-Laced Bean Dip To Co-Worker
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, is accused of giving meth-laced bean dip to a co-worker.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, of Albany, was charged with delivery of methamphetamine and causing another person to ingest a controlled substance, both Class B felonies.
The charges stemmed from an incident that happened Sept. 9 at a Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
A 27-year-old co-worker of the suspect told Marion County Sheriff's Deputies that she went to the deli to get lunch when she saw Medina-Hernandez making bean dip and asked to try some, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by OregonLive.com.
The victim, who told investigators she had never taken meth before, "thought one of the bites she ate tasted odd, but she did not think anything of it," according to the affidavit.
When the woman returned to work, she had an upset stomach and her feet were unsteady.
She went to a local hospital where it was determined the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine, according to the Albany Democrat-Herald.
Police said that another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez "told her about placing drugs inside" the victim's food, while a third worker said the suspect had messaged her claiming the meth was placed in the bean dip by accident, according to The Smoking Gun.
OregonLive reports surveillance video obtained from the deli allegedly shows Medina-Hernandez remove something from inside her bra while her back is to the camera and go behind a microwave and lean down.
She then allegedly wiped her nose after she stood up, walked to a table and placed bean dip in a small paper dish.
The item retrieved from her bra also appeared to be on the plate, police said.
Sheriff's officials said there is currently no reason to believe any customers were served contaminated food, according to the Oregon Statesman-Journal.
Medina-Hernandez is being held in the Marion County jail in lieu of $520,000 bail.
Her lengthy rap sheet shows she was previously convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and felon in possession of a restricted weapon, according to The Smoking Gun.

"The Slovenians played very well in each element.
It's a pity how the final balls of the sets played out, because we had our chances, but we missed them.
We're keeping our heads high, because we still have the game for the bronze on Saturday", said Polish volleyball team's playmaker Marcin Komenda after the 1:3 defeat against Slovenia in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
The talented player appeared on the court in the second and third set.
According to some, Vital Heynen should give him a bigger chance to show his skills.
However, the Eagles' coach decided to go with the experienced Fabian Drzyzga.

Marian Banas
What does the National Tax Administration do about the Supreme Audit Office boss?
Renting immobilities for the price below the market price is the objection that appears in connection with the affair concerning the head of Supreme Audit Office, Marian Banas.
We asked the clerks in the Chamber of Tax Administration in Kraków and the clerks in the Ministry of Finance what the tax authorities are doing about it.
Bertold Kittel showed his objections concerning the declaration of financial interests issued by the head of Supreme Audit Office, Marian Banas in the Superwizjer TVN footage.
These have been investigated by the Central Anticorruption Bureau for several months now.
The investigation is to finish in the second half of October, after the parliament elections.
According to the statement Banas rented a tenement house of 400 square metres as well as two smaller flats.
The total sum of money he earned because of it annually amounted to PLN 65,7 thousand.
The Superwizjer journalists revealed that the tenement house he rents hosts a by-the-hour hotel.
The head of Supreme Audit Office explained later on the public television why he earned from the building rental as little as slightly more than PLN 5 thousand per month.
On the basis of the opinion by property valuation experts Gazeta Wyborcza estimated that the monthly rental costs of the tenement house alone should be PLN 15 thousand per month.
The amount was lower for one simple reason: I concluded a preliminary agreement and only because of the fact that tenant was to buy the tenement house, I agreed on a lower rental fee, but the other receivables will be settled when the tenement house is sold, said Banas.
There were, however, some uncertainties, whether such a behaviour is not against law.
Konrad Zawada, Chamber of Tax Administration spokesperson based in Krakow informed during an interview on TVN24 that the case is being investigated directly by the Ministry of Finance.
He asked to contact the Minister of Finance in case of any questions.
As argued by Zawada, such cases are investigated by the National Tax Administration.
Ministry of Finance spokesperson, Pawel Jurek, admitted that the National Tax Administration are in charge of many cases that could raise any uncertainties.
The National Tax Administration has its own information but also relies to a certain extent on the information available for public.
As the MF spokesperson explained, taking the above into consideration, a decision is made, whether to conduct proceedings on a given matter or not.
When asked about Marian Banas, he told that he was bound by a treasury secret, which is why he has no right to make any statements about a given tax-payer, a given person or a given company.
Finance Minister Jerzy Kwiecinski emphasized that tax authorities do not reveal such information to public.
He stated that the whole tax administration was dealing with many similar matters all over the country.
Royal family secrets: Surprising guests who were frequent fliers on the Royal Plane reveal
As part of their royal duty, the Royal Family have to embark on hundreds of trips around the world in their lifetime.
This is usually made easier by the Royal Plane - a private aircraft which jets the family around the globe to important events and appearances.
Unsurprisingly, having their own private plane comes with its own perks.
Aside not having to wait in long security lines and an unlimited number of bags, it seems the Royal Family can invite onboard any guests they wish - including some unlikely passengers.
According to a recently premiered Channel 5 documentary, the Queen and Prince Phillip aren't the only frequent fliers aboard the Royal Plane.
During the programme 'Secrets of the Royal Flight', a former Navigator of the Queen's Flight revealed that there are also often a number of furrier guests alongside the family.
Bob Shields said: "Occasionally, as well as our very important royal passengers, we might have some very important royal dogs."
It's no surprise that the Queen might request her beloved pets to come along for the journey, as she is renowned for her deep affinity for Corgis.
From a young age Queen Elizabeth has been fond of the four legged creatures, rumoured to have owned more than 30 corgis since she was crowned Monarch.
In 2007 she is believed to have had five corgis named Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, and an additional four dachshund-corgi crossbreeds: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
Staff on board the Royal Plane certainly had their hands full.
The household member of staff would be seen taking the dogs to the grass and pleading with the dogs to please do their business before they went on board the aeroplane, continued Shields.
I am delighted to say we never had one accident.
The programme also revealed the shocking amount of luggage the Queen has been known to travel with while on duty.
According to the shows narrator: "For her 44,000 mile commonwealth tour in 1953 The Queen's luggage weighed 12 tonnes."
To put that into perspective, that is roughly the same as two large elephants.
However, the Queen isn't the only one with an affinity for fashion.
Reportedly the Duchess of Cambridge has her own preferences for transporting her fashion - rumoured to have a seat reserved for each of her dresses.
New act to come into force
The injured in accidents will get disability benefits.
The act coming into force on Friday will ensure further payment of disability benefits for those who were severely injured in accidents, says Financial Ombudsman.
The law in question is the act of 9th July 2019 about special rights of the people injured in accidents in case the sum guaranteed set on the basis of the laws in force before 1st January 2006 is exhausted.
The new act will be effective in case of those who were injured in accidents before 1st January 2006.
The sums guaranteed used to be much lower at that time, which is why some insurance companies stopped paying the disability benefits.
We are happy to hear about this new law because it is since many years that our institution has been insisting on establishing a mechanism that will provide those who were severely injured in accidents a financial support from the motor liability insurance or agricultural liability insurance even if the guaranteed sum is exhausted, says Aleksander Dadzewski, legal counsellor at the Financial Ombudsman office.
According to Financial Ombudsman it was necessary because of the tragic situations in which those severely injured in accidents are not able to work due to their disastrous health condition and still bear the substantial costs of their treatment.
Some of them did not receive any compensatory benefits or benefits for the special needs due to further treatment or rehabilitation since their guaranteed sums of the liability insurance were exhausted.
Others were bound to face it in the coming years.
Until 1st of January 2006 liability limits of the insurance companies were much lower than now.
Therefore, those most likely to be affected by the exhaustion of the guaranteed sum were the people injured in the 1990s.
The guaranteed sums used to be extremely low then and the economy circumstances drove up the prices at an unprecedented rate.
We also noticed that those affected by this problem were mostly young people who got injured when the guaranteed sums amounted to 350 thousand euro per one injured person.
As for now, it is 5,21 million euro per incident, regardless of the injured number.
You can see a substantial difference in comparison to former periods, which is why the problem had to by solved by the legislator, notes Aleksander Daszewski.
He explains that due to the fact that the guaranteed sum is getting higher, the legislator decided that the upper liability limit of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guaranteed sum of the day on which an application for payment is filed at the Fund's office.
This rule is valid when the insurance company is not obliged to pay the disability benefit on the basis of the court's decision to set another amount of the guaranteed sum that the one agreed upon in the civil liability insurance contract.
This is the case when the guaranteed sum is increased through judicial means on the basis of art. 3571 of the Civil Code that enables the modification of the obligation relationship in force.
In the recent days we sent letters to those who used to ask us for taking action in this matter.
We inform them about their new rights and, of course, assure them of our continuous support in case of any problems, says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini sentenced for cutting off her boyfriend’s penis
The case applies to events from November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed his friends a sex tape recorded in their bedroom.
The 28-year old woman, architect by training, was explaining in court that her partner by doing so ruined her life and treated her as a "trophy" you could brag about to friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and career.
He destroyed everything" she argued.
The resident of Cordoba decided to administer justice by herself.
She asked her boyfriend, the 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
She blindfolded him with a velvet band, then grabbed garden shears and cut his penis off.
"I felt as I if were supposed to die.
I didn’t see anything.
I tried to get up, pulled up my trousers, took my mobile to call an ambulance" , testified the victim.
"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She caught me by the shirt and hair preventing me from leaving", he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend harmed her by disclosing the sex tape, she did not attempt to run away from responsibility.
"Please dispense justice", she said to the jury.
Finally, she was found guilty of attempting to commit murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama congressman Jack Edwards dies at 91
Retired 10-term U.S. Rep. Jack Edwards of Alabama, who was in the first wave of Deep South Republicans, died Friday.
His family said through a spokesman that Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after a battle with pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was first elected to the U.S. House in 1965 as part of the first wave of Alabama Republicans elected to Congress as the party gained traction in the Deep South.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
In a statement released by his family, they said Edwards described his hopes for a return to civility when recently asked what kind of world he would like to leave his great grandchildren.
"My hope is that my great grandchildren will grow up in a country where civility will have been returned to common discourse and to the efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said according to the family statement.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and nation with the highest degree of integrity.
The governor said flags at the Alabama Capitol will be placed at half-staff in his honor.
"He was the epitome of a true public servant and was the ultimate statesman for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of our finest," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama Calls Meghan Markle 'An Inspiration' In Adoring Instagram
Michelle Obama gave high praise to Meghan Markle in a sweet Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it."
The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.
"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.
"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited.
In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.
"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.
Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside.
Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping.
"The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot," she said.
So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work.
I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that.
Trump hotel keeps liquor license despite character complaint
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Washington Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has dismissed a request to review whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its liquor license over its owner's character.
The agency ruled Wednesday that the complaint by three ministers, two retired judges and two rabbis lacked standing because most of them didn't live in or own property in the District.
The Washington Post reports this is the second time the complainants pushed for the revocation of the hotel's liquor license over a District law that says license applicants must be of "good character."
The initial complaint filed last summer says President Donald Trump violates that law, citing assault allegations and patterns of deception.
It was killed because the license had already been granted.
The second complaint was prompted by the license's renewal.
Scandal-hit Cleveland Police force branded the worst in Britain in damning report - The Sun
A SCANDAL-HIT police force has been branded Britain's worst by inspectors.
Cleveland Police was rated as inadequate in all areas in a damning report.
HM's Inspectorate of Constabulary Phil Gormley says Cleveland Police force has seen 'significant deterioration'
The force, which has had five chief constables in six years, is now facing fresh calls for it to be disbanded.
The report found it was failing in efforts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the vulnerable.
HM's Inspectorate of Constabulary Phil Gormley said: "There has been a significant deterioration since our last inspection."
Chief Constable Mike Veale quit in January after less than a year while facing an investigation into "serious" but undisclosed allegations about his behaviour.
Assistant Chief Constable Adrian Roberts is suspended after being arrested on suspicion of gross misconduct.
Last year Det Insp Simon Hurwood appeared before a misconduct panel for grooming colleagues for sex.
He quit the force.
Tees Valley's Tory Mayor Ben Houchen said: "This is official validation that the force is broken.
It's now time for the Home Office to intervene."
Chief Constable Richard Lewis said: "Improvements have been made and I take full responsibility for driving through change."
We Have a Visualisation of the Skate Park!
Will young people see it at last?
Older residents are disturbed by young fans of kickboards and skateboards who, in turn, complaint there is no appropriate place for them in Oława.
Young people have requested some place to ride rollerblades, skateboards, kickboards or bikes for years.
This topic keeps returning in our paper.
We have been turning your attention to this problem for 10 years.
Recently, the topic of the skate park absence has come up again.
This is why we are returning to it and ask about the future in the office.
Let us remind we were contacted by a woman bothered by young people riding or skating in the centre a few days ago.
"I am writing in the name of residents of the block of flats at Piłsudskiego Street to request you to get interested in the situation of young people from Oława", Małgorzata writes to the editors.
"The block residents have called the Municipal Office many times, but without any effect.
I am enclosing photos to prove such everyday situations."
We asked other people about their opinion in this case.
Most of them state clearly young people simply have nowhere to ride or skate in the town and have demanded some place for themselves for years, though in vain.
A storm of comments appeared under the Facebook post.
In July we wrote there was a chance for the skate park to be constructed in Miasteczko in Oława.
The mayor informed the town applied for subsidy to construct the skate park.
"The design, consulted with young people, is ready and has all the permits.
On 28 March there was an application for subsidies for «The Skate Park Construction in Oława» submitted in the Ministry of Sports and Tourism within the Sportowa Polska programme", we heard in the office.
The total project value: PLN 798,306.00.
The subsidy amount applied for: PLN 263,440.00.
Now, we have asked again what stage the case is at.
"We have no information on the outcome concerning the application for subsidy submitted to the Ministry of Sports and Tourism", says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the European Fund Department in the Municipal Office in Oława.
"According to the information obtained from the Ministry employees, the final selection of all tasks within the Sportowa Polska Programme should take place in October."
We asked also for the visualisation of the skate park in Oława.
This is presented below.
Young people told the editors they were going to collect signatures under the petition concerning the construction of skate park in Oława next Saturday (28 September).
"The rebellious young people saw the latest Facebook post and came to the conclusion they were going to organise a collection", Mikołaj wrote to the editors.
The signatures under the petition will be collected from 12:00 p.m. near the Lidl market.
The Polish Cup 2019/20: draw for the 1/16 final.
We know the pairs, a hit from years ago
That was one of the most fierce rivalries in the Ekstraklasa league.
The most legendary was the memorable match of the 1996/1997 season.
On 18th June 1997 Legia played at home against the team from Łodź at the old stadium at Łazienkowska Street.
Both teams were just one point apart.
The home team had to win, one point would give Widzew the second Polish championship in a row.
Until the 87th minute Legia had the lead of 2:0, but within the five next minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Club from Łódź was getting into trouble over years, and then stopped being considered a candidate to win the championship and finally fell out of the top league.
The last encounter of both teams at that level took place in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – on their way to the title – had two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 away.
Back to the elite
Currently the team from Łódź is struggling to return to the national elite.
The plans delayed by at least a year, because as a favourite in the previous rounds they did not manage to get promoted to the backstage of the Ekstraklasa league.
As a result of the failure, a revolution in team composition took place in summer.
The management changed, finally they chose Marcin Kaczmarek as coach, while the league battle tested Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżeń are supposed to help to take another step up in the club hierarchy.
For now Widzew is the fourth in the II league table, but in the Polish Cup it beat the Ekstraklasa league vice-leader, Śląsk Wrocław 2:0.
Legia at an away match outplayed Puszcza Niepołomice getting the same score.
Clash in Ekstraklasa league
One of the pairs composed of top class representatives in the 1/16 final include its expansion team ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
Matches of that stage will take part on 29th–31st October.
For this year 1/8 final matches are scheduled to be played yet (3rd–5th December).
The final match is planned on 2nd May at PGE Narodowy stadium in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr has 'gone rogue' and impeachment investigation needs to take its course
You never know where we're going next.
Now, I think we're getting involved in the coverup of the coverup, and that may be something that will take some time to investigate," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.
"They will do the work that they're set out to do, following the facts and the time that it takes to find the facts," she said.
A White House transcript released this week showed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and Biden's son.
Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani on the issue, the call transcript revealed.
Trump has denied he did anything improper.
CNN reported on Thursday that Justice Department national security lawyers were first alerted to the whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal referral.
After receiving the complaint as a referral from the intelligence community officials, the DOJ determined that Trump's phone call did not warrant a campaign finance criminal investigation.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call as witnesses.
But she added that she believes Barr "has gone rogue."
He has for a long time now.
"Since (Barr) was mentioned in all of this," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general on the July call with Ukraine's leader.
It's curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.
Pelosi said she's "very worried" about the whistleblower's sources, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies and suggested that in the old days spies were dealt with differently.
I think what the President said goes beyond irresponsible, it's dangerous.
Our whistleblowers have an important role to play in unfolding -- revealing wrongdoing in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "For the President to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal impeachment inquiry over the allegations that he attempted to pressure a foreign leader for political gain.
The phone call was included in a complaint publicly released Thursday, in which a whistleblower alleged Trump abused his powers to "solicit interference" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information.

Christian Benteke: Crystal Palace striker faces driving ban for speeding
Premier League star Christian Benteke is facing a possible driving ban after he was caught speeding twice in two months.
The Crystal Palace striker, 28, has admitted driving his Bentley at 80mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 in Richmond, south west London, on January 20.
The Belgian was then flashed by speed cameras at 89mph, more than double the 40mph limit, in Putney, south west London, in March.
Benteke, of Kingston Hill, Surrey, is not required to be present at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court this morning.
He pleaded guilty to both offences at the start of July under the single justice procedure, where minor offences are decided by a magistrate sitting alone.

Ghana: Kofi Manu Concerned Over Structure of Vetting Committee
Mr. Kofi Manu, a football administrator and an official of Sekondi Hasaacas has raised concerns over the composition of the Vetting Committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.
He questioned the inclusion of the Committee's Chairman, Mr. Frank Davies, adding that he was not happy with his inclusion.
Mr. Manu in an interview with the GNA Sport said, he had doubts the Chairman of the Committee would be fair since he had interest in the outcome of the vetting process.
The Vetting Committee should be neutral people from outside who have not shown affiliation with any member and who have not shown interest before.
For instance, Mr. Davies was contracted by the NC as a lawyer to write to Osei Kwaku Palmer concerning a 10 per cent payment.
He is also a known Olympics supporter.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to serve on the vetting committee because he has interest," he argued.
Mr. Manu said there would be conflict of interest on the Chairman's part if Mr. Fred Pappoe, a Director of Olympics appear before the Committee because of his affiliation to the club whilst suggesting there would be prejudice and partiality towards Mr. Palmer if he appeared before the Committee.
Members of the Committee were expected to begin work from yesterday and end on October 4 after being sworn in at a ceremony held at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Thursday September 19.
The chairman of the Committee is Mr. Frank Davies with Corporate Governance Consultant and legal practitioner, Mrs. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah as members.
Other members are Mr. Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Executive and Mr. Richard Akpokavie, a Sports Administrator and Legal Practitioner.

Israel: No agreement on a national unity government
On Friday, the two main parties of Israel, the alliance of Blue and White and Likud, continued negotiations on appointing a national unity government.
The meeting that took place after entrusting Benjamin Netanyahu the task of forming the government did not bring any results.
According to the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz, the possibility of rotational governance of both parties and leaving Netanyahu as a Prime Minister was considered during discussions, but the views were not aligned.
Talks will continue on Sunday.
The centrist alliance of Blue and White announced in their statement that they presented initial postulates.
They accuse the right-wing Likud of "entrenching in their positions," demanding its leader and current Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain in charge of the government, and the cabinet to be composed of former ultra-Orthodox politicians.
"From the beginning it was known that Blue and White would not agree to these conditions," we can read in a published statement.
"Likud wants, acting solely in Netanyahu's interests, to bring about the second round of elections in Israel".
Blue and White's leader Benny Gantz denies support to the government led by Netanyahu as long as he faces charges in three corruption scandals, on the basis of which the prosecution could indict him after a Wednesday sitting.
"On election day, on 17 September, Likud and Blue and White secured a sufficient majority that would help them to govern jointly as natural allies, but it also forces them to negotiate and neither party wants to do that," writes the EFE agency.
In recent days, President Reuven Rivlin has tried to bridge the gap between their viewpoints and proposed forming a "rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister should suspend his functions, which would help Gantz to take over this position, if the indictment against Netanyahu was sustained and formalised.
Many Israeli analysts claim that negotiations are at a dead end.
However, according to the poll data published by the public TV on Friday, half of Israelis want unblock the political situation in the state by forming a national unity government in which Gantz and Netanyahu would rotate as prime ministers.
50.6% of Israelis are in favour of this solution, and 32.1% of respondents are opposed to such a solution.
The poll shows a deep division in Israeli society – when asked who should be prime minister first, 41.8% of respondents choose Netanyahu and 40% Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper Israel Hayom, the percentage of supporters of the national unity government has risen to 63%, and 60% of respondents are against the new elections that would be the third this year.
In the pre-term parliamentary elections held on 17 September, Gantz's alliance won, gaining 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, while Netanyahu's Likud party won 32 seats.
Netanyahu, with his traditional and potential allies, can count on the support from 55 members of the Knesset, while Gantz from 54.
Neither faction won the 61 seats needed to achieve a majority.
Tipuric issues rallying call ahead of Aussie showdown
Justin Tipuric says "it is time to perform" when Wales face a World Cup showdown against Australia that could shape their destiny in the tournament.
Victory for Wales against the Wallabies would install them as red-hot favourites to win Pool D and secure a likely quarter-final appointment with France or Argentina.
But if Australia beat Wales for a 14th time in the last 15 meetings, it could send Tipuric and company hurtling towards a last-eight clash against England.
"There is no bones about it, both teams want to try and get through and finish top of the group," Wales flanker Tipuric said.
There have been some tough results in the past, but it was nice to get a win last autumn against them (Australia).
I think they will be chomping at the bit to get that back from us, and we want to make sure we get another win.
Before we even came in here, you knew this was going to be a big one.
Now we are here, it's time to perform, really.
Wales have only claimed one victory against Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - and that was 32 years ago in a third-place play-off when they toppled the Wallabies.
And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows just seven wins from 41 attempts at the hands of the three southern hemisphere heavyweights.
Wales halted a 13-Test losing sequence at Australia's hands last November, with Tipuric set to be among several survivors from that 9-6 success who run out at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Asked if there had been a mental block prior to that win, Tipuric added: "It's tough to say.
Those games are so tight, there is maybe... people would expect there was a bit of a mental block, I don't know.
In the end in the last game we probably left about 15 points out there, so it made the scoreline look a lot closer than it actually was."
If Wales are to triumph, then Tipuric's battle at the breakdown with Australia's revered back-row double act Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial.
The 67 times-capped Tipuric has encountered both players on several previous occasions, and he knows exactly what is coming.
"They are absolutely world-class sevens," he said.
When you play against world-class back-rowers you always know you are going to be in for a tough game.
Those two are consistently up there with the best in the world.
You know what type of game you are going to be in for.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world over the ball defensively - and Michael is more of an attacking seven and probably has a bit more of a rugby brain to be in the right place at the right time.
You would rather play the best players in the world and challenge yourself, rather than face a back-row that isn't as good.
You want to play against the best, and you know against those two you will have to be on form.
I wouldn't say that Sunday is so much a cup final, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
Momentum is an important part of it.
If you keep on building and putting in good performances, you are going to be flying and tough to beat.
EastEnders spoilers: Ben kisses Callum after Whitney's bombshell
The sizzling tension between Callum Highway (Tony Clay) and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) is set to explode once more in EastEnders as a sudden bombshell from Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) leaves Callum thrown - and leads him back into the arms of his lover.
But will they commence a relationship or will they regret their heated moment?
Since Callum helped to save Ben's life and then also stepped up for a struggling Bobby Beale (Clay Milner Russell), he and Ben have been taking things slowly but have been flirting with the idea of going on a date, with Callum recently telling Ben that it was nice to see his vulnerable and softer side.
Tonight, Whitney returns from her holiday in a much better frame of mind than she left.
It's clearly done her the world of good to get away from Walford in the wake of her disastrous wedding and the revelation that her husband-to-be had cheated on her.
As she arrives home, she ends up having a heart to heart with Callum.
But soon, she hits him with a revelation that leaves him reeling.
As Callum reacts badly, Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick) is concerned to see him knocking back the booze in the Queen Vic.
Drunk and emotional, Callum marches round to Ben's and confronts him over everything that has happened, blaming him.
Ben is calm and accepts the outburst before offering solace to Callum and before long, Callum's frustration turns into passion as they share a kiss.
But where will they go from here?
The couple will attempt a date next week but after Ben is given food for thought over his relationship history, it threatens to derail everything that the couple are working towards.
But after standing up to his homophobic dad, a newly confident Callum is determined to fight for what he wants - and deserves.
EastEnders airs the kiss on Friday 27th September at 8:30pm on BBC One.
Book Launch.
Waffen-SS Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were to be an elite organisation of the "master race".
They accepted the ones they despised.
Can a crime connect stronger than the national identity?
We are presenting another book devoted to the war or military issues.
We give a deep international study on non-Germans participating in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries analyse the attitudes and motives of volunteers, remind of their activity, and look at the recruitment processes at particular war stages.
Did Danish troops differ from the French ones?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create troops composed solely of Poles?
What is the official historical narration concerning collaboration in particular European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war finished?
Those are some of the questions answered by Waffen-SS based on robust study material.
We strove to present a more subtle and balanced, truer picture of collaboration in Europe during World War II, trying also to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period in history by presenting dissertations by researchers from various countries. (...) Even when the fate of the major victims of this war – forced labourers, Jews, captives, political opponents of Nazi Germany, Slavic people – sometimes are presented comparatively and/or supranationally, the perpetrators are studied basically from the national perspective (if it is done at all).
'Total panic' as White House struggles to find impeachment footing
White House officials were scrambling to figure out how to counter the renewed Democratic impeachment push Thursday, with one source familiar with the situation describing a sense of "total panic" over the past week at the lack of a plan to address the new reality.
There appears to be rising "anxiety, unease, and concern" - as one person close to the White House described the mood in the West Wing - that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously wound the president and some of those around him.
"There's not a lot of confidence that there's no there there," this person said.
White House officials remained unsure of how to proceed, not only because is there no apparent plan for the situation, but because the allegations are so serious that the usual methods the president has used to successfully escape past controversies may not apply: "This doesn't look like something that's going to be overtaken by the next news cycle," the person quipped.
Another person familiar with the discussions described the mood inside the White House as "shell-shocked," with increasing wariness that as this impeachment inquiry drags out, the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become "unmanageable."
That concern was echoed by another source, who said some around the president anticipate he will engage in more "impulsive" behavior, with pressure expected to build on him daily during the impeachment inquiry.
That's sparking worries that Trump could display increasingly unpredictable behavior and lash out in unexpected ways - both a presidential and a political concern in an election year environment.
With his presidency facing what may be its biggest threat yet, Trump has cycled from offense to defense, reviving a strategy that he viewed as effective during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
He tried to downplay his request for the Ukrainian president to help investigate his political rivals, to divert attention to actions by Democrats and presidential contender Joe Biden, and to discredit the whistleblower as having partisan motives.
But while many in the White House are battle-tested from the Mueller investigation, this time is starting to feel different, aides and advisers said.
For a president whose brand is viewed as strength, Wednesday's press conference made him look defeated, said one person familiar with the situation.
While Trump relished questions on the Russia investigation, he seemed to be in no mood to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some allies of the president believe the damage could be mitigated, with some seizing on the fact that the whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the controversial call in question between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - a fact which they argue damages his or her credibility.
And, as often happens, when the president is under siege, that fact energizes his core supporters in his defense.
But one Republican strategist close to the White House points out that the president's base approval ratings are already sky-high - and impeachment will do little to win over new supporters.
"There is no upside to having the next four months focused on the president's impeachment," particularly if it stymies his legislative agenda and dominates the news cycle.
Another of the sources said that those who were arguing impeachment could help the president weren't fully grasping how much of a wild card his response could be.
Worried White House officials have been reaching out to advisers for help in assembling an impeachment response team.
With the effort still in the early phases, it remained unclear whether any type of war room-style effort would come to fruition or what form it might take, according to a person briefed on the plans.
But there was an acknowledgement that a coordinated legal and communications strategy was needed, with a clear leader able to marshal a public relations offensive to counter the release of the scathing whistleblower report and the momentum its release has given Democratic impeachment efforts, that person said.
The lack of a long-term strategic vision has been starkly visible, as when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin indicated they were not going to release the memo describing Trump's call with the Ukrainian president - and then 48 hours later, feeling there was no choice but to release the document, according the source familiar with the situation.
It is anticipated there will be more pressure now than during the investigation by Robert Mueller, who was mostly silent, speaking only through his indictments. One person who may become involved in developing an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, Trump's outside pit bull and former campaign manager, said the person involved in the matter.
But Lewandowski told NBC News it was not accurate to suggest he would lead such an effort.
"For the last five years, I've done everything I can to support the president and his agenda," he said, "but I have had no discussions with president and his team at all about joining a team to push back on this fake impeachment narrative."
Trump's outside lawyer from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also remaining involved in the impeachment efforts.
"We will deal with matters as appropriate," Sekulow said when reached by NBC News for comment.
The White House currently lacks a lawyer experienced in impeachment now that Emmet Flood, who worked on the Clinton impeachment and guided the White House through the end of the Mueller investigation, has left, with current White House counsel Pat Cipollone lacking that type of experience.
One source familiar with the White House strategy said that overall, officials were nowhere near the point of bringing people on board or setting up war rooms - but acknowledge they need a coordinated, all hands-on-deck response effort and someone who can lead a political fight, the person said.
Royal Caribbean Explorer of the Seas cruise ship £89 million renovation revealed
The Explorer of the Seas, part of the Royal Caribbean International family, is to set sail with a brand new look this summer.
Following an impressive $110 million (£89 million) revamp, the vessel boasts an array of global culinary delights, as well as fun for the whole family.
This summer the Explorer will dock at some of the finest ports across Italy and Greece, giving passengers a taste of Mediterranean Europe.
However, even once the adventure on land has ended, the ship promises to offer an experience to remember at sea.
Offering something for everyone, The Explorer's new $110m - or roughly £89,000,000 - boost has transformed the liner into a perfect family escape.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on deck thanks to an advanced surf simulator or watch a family favourite while enjoying the weather at the outdoor cinema.
However, possibly the most ground-breaking feature of all is the addition of virtual balconies, allowing interior room passengers the opportunity to take in the ocean vistas from inside.
For the water babies, the reimagined swimming pool deck boasts the style of a Caribbean resort, with the fun of a waterpark.
Island-style hammocks and daybeds surround the pool ideal for relaxing in the sun, meanwhile two updated waterslides are on hand for the thrill-seekers onboard.
Appealing to all ages, the cruise liner boasts a number of activities to pass the time between destinations.
For the little ones, the kid's Adventure Ocean gives smaller members of the family an opportunity to make some memories, meanwhile an exclusive teen hangout offers a cool games and music area specifically designed for over 12s.
If that's not enough, the whole family can go head to head in a game of glow-in-the-dark laser tag at the ship's "studio B," which impressively doubles as an ice-skating rink.
While sailing the Mediterranean seas, guests will also have the chance to explore exotic flavours from around the world, thats a diverse expansion of the restaurants onboard.
Updated Asian cuisine is on offer at the ship's Izumi restaurants, meanwhile a modern take on traditional Italian cuisine will offer the finest food in a casual setting at the brand new Giovanni's Italian Kitchen.
Other eateries onboard include Chops Grille American Steakhouse, Boleros Latin Bar, Schooner Bar and Johnny Rockets Express.
With a choice of seven and nine night itineraries, the cruise is due to depart from Rome in May 2020.
As Royal Caribbean's second European ship, it will join Allure of the Seas which has also recently undergone a jaw-dropping transformation.
Following the Allure's 58-day makeover, which totalled a whopping $165million, the cruise operator gave guests who booked early a bonus $300 worth of onboard spending money.
According to the cruise operator: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth ship in the Voyager Class to be transformed as part of the cruise line's Royal Amplified fleet modernisation effort."
An investment of more than $1 billion, across 10 ships in four years, the programme touches every facet of the guest experience and introduces a wide range of thrilling adventures spanning one-of-a-kind attractions and experiential dining and nightlife.
Devin Nunes Accuses Democrats Of Wanting 'Nude Pictures Of Trump'
Congressman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) apparently can't "bare" the thought of President Donald Trump being investigated.
And in his defense of the president on Thursday, he accused Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of the president.
Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, made the accusation during his opening statement at the hearing about the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought Ukrainian help in investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukraine scandal a "grotesque spectacle" created by the left and their "media assets" before claiming the Democrats wanted to see photos of the president in the buff:
"Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
People can reasonably ask why the Democrats are so determined to impeach this president when in just a year, they will have a chance.
After Nunes finished his dressing-down, HuffPost senior political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to find out if Democratic politicians are trying to get to the, um, bottom of this.
So far, only Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes (D) has responded, but we suspect his answer is the naked truth for many of his colleagues as well.
Mediaite.com suspects Nunes' clothing-optional comments were a reference to "some of the more salacious and unconfirmed details" that supposedly appear in the controversial Steele Dossier.
That's the infamous collection of explosive allegations against Trump compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that mentions the possible existence of a "pee tape," which allegedly shows him watching sex workers engage in "golden showers" in a Moscow hotel room.
Potential renewable biofuel research could help lower emissions
While electric cars and Tesla semi-trucks have dominated the headlines in recent years, one thing flies seemingly out of the reach of renewable energy: airplanes.
But a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that could allow renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences who began this project in 2003.
His lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes like restaurant grease, animal renderings, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils in its production, allowing it to not only release an estimated 85 per cent less carbon emissions than petroleum-based fuels, but also utilizing wastes from other industries in the process.
The technology works to mimic the hydrocarbons present in petroleum-based fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," Bressler said. "is [actually make] the hydrocarbons which are the exact molecules in diesel gasoline."
While this presents a new option for biofuel use, previously produced biofuel technologies tend to de-stabilize at lower temperatures, which, for an aircraft travelling at high altitudes, poses a serious problem.
"The problem with jet fuel is it's a bit of a catch-22," Bressler said.
It's actually worth less than diesel but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's lab is currently looking at two options for producing jet biofuel.
The first being a low-risk approach which requires giving their hydrocarbon biofuel another treatment and adding in hydrogen.
The second option is to continue work on already partially developed chemistry which would keep the fuel stable, even at lower temperatures.
"We can actually play some games with the chemistry in our reactor to try to change the chemistry a little bit," Bressler said about the second option.
That one's a higher risk.
The University of Alberta spin-off company Forge Hydrocarbons is working on commercializing the product as airlines and both the Canadian and American militaries are increasingly investing in the renewable option.
"They can see [a] future where one day somebody might turn around and charge them a carbon tax," he said.
They want an alternative in place that is a fallback position.
Currently, Forge runs a pilot plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Centre and recently acquired a US$4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to support the construction of a $25-million production facility to be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The facility is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel each year.
Bressler also notes while estimates for carbon reductions are around 85 per cent, aspects such as how the fuel is transported and produced are reasons for why carbon reductions aren't higher.
"As a technology guy," Bressler said.
My job is to create options so there can be an informed decision and multiple choices on which to go with.
ZAMOŚĆ: Another grandson scam
8 thousand PLN and 750 EUR lost a resident of Zamość thinking that she was helping her grandson who had caused an accident.
The police was notified about the incident by a son of the cheated resident of Zamość.
"A man claiming to be her grandson called the woman on Wednesday".
He told her that he had caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he would go to prison.
The senior lady willing to help her grandson gave 8 thousand PLN and 750 EUR to the fake policeman who came to her home’, reports asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubiło from the police in Zamość.
Police officers are looking for the perpetrator and reappeal to stay cautious.
"Each phone call with a request for financial assistance should be verified.
We should not yield to emotions and haste.
Let’s remember: policemen do not ask for money and do not accept money.
If you receive a phone call with a request for financial support that arouses our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling emergency phone number 112.
We are appealing to the younger family members.
Let’s discuss the dangers with our seniors and inform how the cheaters act.
Ask them to stay cautious and do not trust the persons who call and ask for a loan".
Boris Johnson's allies warn Britain faces LA-style RIOTS if Brexit is reversed as PM calls for calm.
A senior cabinet minister last night said the country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the original result.
The Prime Minister's senior allies warned the UK faces civil unrest on the scale of the yellow vest protests in France over economic inequalities and Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Mr Johnson said "tempers need to come down" in the furious row over political language - but insisted he won't stop using the word "surrender."
Despite his appeal for calm, a cabinet minister told The Times: "In this country we never had the gilets jaunes [yellow vests] or the LA riots [in 1992].
People don't think it's possible in this country just because it has not happened before.
Now they have a model - gilets jaunes - they have encrypted phones to co-ordinate it, and it only takes a couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people.
Riots in erupted in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four white police officers for beating up a black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.
Earlier this year, anti-government French protesters wearing yellow high visibility vests - gilet jaunes have been wrought havoc and destruction on the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister pointed to Mr Johnson's warning in the Commons that there would be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system" if Britain failed to leave the EU.
"If we have a referendum with 30 million people who vote, and we vote Remain by 66 per cent, that's ten million people who are unhappy," said the minister.
Even if 99 per cent of them shrug it off, that's still 100,000 really angry people who will write to their MP and not let it go.
It doesn't take much and soon you have tens of thousands of people on the street.
A senior cabinet minister added that country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the result of the first one.
Mr Johnson has called for there to be a general election to allow voters to settle Brexit.
It has been reported he is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU instead.
Hołownia, Czubówna and Krosny delighted the audience in Cracow.
Talk'N"Roll is now behind us.
On Thursday (26 September), over 300 participants listened to 11 inspiring performances of speakers such as, among others, Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
That all took place as a part of the Talk'N'Roll Conference which was held in Cracow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding horizons, conversations about ideas worth spreading and discussions that could become an impetus for further growth.
That was the goal of the Talk'N'Roll Conference's organisers who invited to the stage 11 special speakers, representing various industries and with different areas of interest, including well-known media people – Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This year's Talk'N'Roll theme was "Crafting the future, NOW" and the performances of the guests were focused on creating the future.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about personal branding and its influence on our future.
Richard Lucas took the stage to change the way the audience felt about rejection, claiming that if we want to craft the future, it should be accepted, then, Chris Badura spoke about empathy in the era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared with the audience her insights and techniques that could help them manage their careers and increase their overall satisfaction by finding the right work-life balance.
During a multi-threaded conversation Krystyna Czubówna, who opened the second part of the conference, talked about how from her perspective the voice-over profession in Poland has changed over the years.
One of the most famous voices in the country said that, thanks to technological development, now anyone can take up this profession.
However, according to her, in the upcoming years, voice-over artists will not be completely replaced by technology.
After her performance, Piotr Nabielec took up the problem of living in the time of information overload, emotional overload and choice overload, giving the audience valuable pieces of advice on how to cope with it, then, in his speech Łukasz Łętocha talked about what the forthcoming industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, may lead to.
Teaching by entertaining, entertaining by teaching
The conference's organisers covered artistic entertainment as well, inviting magician Daniel Jedynak to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who at first entertained the audience with his mime show, and then he discussed how, based on his own career, he tries to maintain the right balance between a career on stage and private life.
Szymon Hołownia also gripped the audience with his speech primarily highlighting the role of time in our lives.
The publicist emphasised that even two minutes can completely change a situation, and we have to be ready to use this time.
What is more, Hołownia shared his thoughts about the reality that surrounds us, bringing up his own anecdotes that brought smiles to many participants' faces.
Then, there was Adrian Tworuszka, who reviewed the history and purpose of several innovation models and spoke about how they have been used recently.
At the end, Marcin Słowiak, with the example of the Rubik's cube, talked about an approach to problem-solving.
Each of 11 speakers brought something fresh and new in terms of perception of reality for every person who had the opportunity to witness the performances – the spontaneous reactions and myriad of questions from guests indicated the audience's earnest engagement.
The organisers provided transmission for everyone who could not personally attend the event via the website.
Rule by law instead of rule of law
"In spite of too few votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority have introduced a number of changes in the state system, posing a threat to the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers" writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in a report published on Thursday.
The report "Rule by law instead of rule of law" documents, among other things, the changes in the judicial system and the domain of basic rights and freedom protection.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR) on Thursday released a report entitled "Rule by law instead of rule of law".
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015–2019".
The foundation in the report assesses that in 2015–2019 the highest decline in the protection of human rights after 1989 was noted.
"In spite of too few votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority have introduced a number of changes in the state system, posing a threat to the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers"
By adjusting law to political purposes the rule of law was replaced by the rule by law", report the HFHR experts.
What does the HFHR report contain?
The report documents the changes in the functioning of judicial system, independent institutions (such as public broadcasters or the Ombudsman) and in the domain of the protection of basic rights and freedoms (including the freedom of assembly, women rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises the three-year lasting dispute between the Polish authority and the European Union.
"For the first time over the last four years and on such a scale we have been observing the use of law to implement particular party interests.
It translates into a lasting crisis in the rule of law and the impairment of the whole human rights protection system in Poland", emphasised lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As shown in the report, the last four years has been the "period of changes both in the state" but also "in the scope of human rights protection".
Over the last four years the Sejm has adopted over 20 legal acts crucial in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes were frequently adopted hastily, without any social consultations and despite warnings from legal communities, the Ombudsman or international organisations", explained spokesperson, Małgorzata Szuleka, a report co-author.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years include: "Impairing independent institutions (including courts and prosecutor’s office), disrespecting court decisions and the recommendations of international organisations as well as impairing the guarantees of human rights".
State organs have not responded
Especially alarming for the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights were "the situations, where state authorities did not respond or just neglected the emerging cases of aggression".
The Foundation experts have noticed that some changes were introduced in the climate of attacks on particular institutions, occupational groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The foundation shows that the state activity in the realm of limiting the principles of rule of law results in a lasting dispute between the Polish authority and the European Union as well as a number of recommendations provided by international judicial organisations.
"The lack of those recommendations impairs the position of Poland as leader of democratic transformations in the Central-Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to legal liability caused by violating the law of European Union or the European Convention on Human Rights", shows the report.
Pakistan social media star's brother gets life for her 'honour' murder
Women's rights experts say that enforcement of justice is often lax, with proceedings at times being drawn out while accused killers were freed on bail and cases faded away.
"It takes too long, people forget," said Farzana Bari, a women's rights advocate and founder of Pakistan's first gender studies department at a university, adding that even the high-profile Baloch case had taken over three years to be resolved.
Though rights groups say reliable data is hard to establish, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan found at least 300 cases of "honour killing" in 2018.
Many advocates say the actual number is far higher, with the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network estimating that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honour killings globally each year.
Record-breaking Earnings of Poles Abroad
However, the money orders to Poland decrease as many emigrants settle outside Poland for good, as mentioned by the Friday edition of "Rzeczpospolita" daily.
According to the latest report by Euro-Tax, the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries reached more than 8.6 thousand PLN in 2018, meaning they grew by close to one thousand zlotys, i.e. close to 12 per cent.
We can read that according to Euro-Tax estimates, the "total earnings of the Polish economic emigrants in the European Union countries reached a record-breaking value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than in the previous year".
The Head of the Center of Migration Studies of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says Poles are coping better and better on the international labour market where they use various available options.
The daily notes "the number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country looking for better conditions, just like employees of international corporations".
Some customers of Euro-Tax work in two countries during a year, e.g. in the United Kingdom and Germany.
"It is the Federal Republic of Germany where the total earnings of the Polish emigrants grew most, as by 11 percent, in 2018 (to reach close to PLN 27 billion).
However, Poles earned the most on the British Isles anyway, as it was close to PLN 35 billion", we read.
The President of Euro-Tax believes the number of economic emigrants does not decrease despite improved working conditions on the Polish market.
The seasonal job in the West and in the north of Europe (with Norway in the lead) is often a chance to earn twice more than in Poland.
"And this is true even given the minimum rates in a given country, which are e.g. 9.5–11.7 EUR per hour in Germany", the weekly reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" states Poles stay abroad not only because of higher earnings but also because they got settled abroad.
Many Poles put down roots abroad which can be seen even based on decreasing money orders to Poland.
The ones last year were the lowest for years.
Economist Tadeusz Chrościcki reminds that the longer the period of staying abroad, the smaller the group of people transferring money to Poland and the lower the transferred amounts.
"Emigrants take their closest ones to them", as we can read in the Friday "Rzeczpospolita" edition.
Prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India
India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.
Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal.
If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.
Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.
Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall.
Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.
The monsoon was also late to arrive.
Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.
The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year.
"It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food.
Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).
Festivals are also at risk.
The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.
Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil.
But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.

Doodle celebrating the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine today's world without Google.
We use the search engine to look for answers to all our haunting questions.
What do we search for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?", "How much", "How many?", these are the favourite search categories of Poles.
According to the search giant's data, last year, we asked i.a. "Where is the storm?", "How do you cook asparagus?" and "How many fingers and toes does a horse have?", "How do you get rid of fruit flies?, "How do you eat a persimmon?".
Today, the search engine celebrates its twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and in Poland 96% of people use "Uncle Google" – are greeted by the special Google Doodle each time the access the site.
This time it is not animated.
Google celebrates its birthday by showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the lower right corner a digitally printed date, like in the 90s photo.
Information indexing
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was meant to index all possible information and share it through the Internet.
Its name is a play on words.
It comes from a mathematical term, "googol", meaning the number ten to the hundredth power.
The name was also intended to reflect the enterprise's plan to index as many sites from the world Internet resources as possible.
The Google search engine was launched in 1996 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as a part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of correlations between websites that worked better than methods of simple result sorting based on the frequency of occurrence of a given phrase.
At first, the search engine was known as BlackRub, referring to the English word "blacklink", which means the number of links pointing to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company under the name of Google Inc. on 7 September 1998, and shortly afterwards they launched the famous website google.com.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, PC Magazine published information on the extremely accurate results of Google search.
After that, the history of the company played out like a fairytale: rapid development with every month, expanding into new markets and dramatic increase of the company's value.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index had more than a billion positions, making Page and Brin's work the largest search engine in the world.
Now the company set up by Page and Brin is one of the leading players on the IT market.
Is there any room for development?
"The mission of Google is to organise the world's information resources to make them widely available and useful, although we have made great progress in this field, there is still a long way ahead to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland in an interview with Newsweek.
Heavy exposure to pesticides may boost risk of heart disease, stroke
Working around high levels of pesticides may translate into a high risk for heart trouble later, a new study suggests.
That was the case for a group of Japanese-American men in Hawaii who were followed for more than three decades.
Compared to men who had not worked around pesticides, those who had the greatest exposure had a 45 percent higher risk for heart disease or stroke, researchers found.
"This study emphasizes the importance of using personal protective equipment during exposure to pesticides on the job and the importance of documenting occupational exposure to pesticides in medical records, as well as controlling standard heart disease risk factors," said study co-author Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
The findings stem from data on more than 6,000 men on Oahu who took part in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Because only men of Japanese descent were involved, the findings may not apply to women or other populations, the researchers noted.
Since pesticides have a long half-life, their effects on health may show up years after exposure.
In this case, the greatest effects were seen within 10 years of exposure.
"After following the men for 34 years, the link between being exposed to pesticides at work and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant," Rodriguez said in a news release.
This was probably because other factors tied to aging became more important, masking the possible relation of pesticides and cardiovascular disease later in life.
Researchers found no significant link between exposure to low to moderate amounts of pesticides and the risk of heart disease or stroke.
The Zelensky-Trump phone call: Poroshenko weighs in
It was an explosive week in Washington politics, with impeachment proceedings launched against US President Donald Trump.
For political novice Volodymyr Zelensky, being swept up into a political scandal is a move he would have wanted to avoid.
But what do we know so far about the Zelensky-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the former?
Quite early on in the phone call, Trump tells Zelensky that the US is doing more for Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the calls notes released by the White House is not verbatim, it details Trump taking a hit at German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that the German leader and other European counterparts engage in talks rather than concrete proposals.
It was Zelensky's response that has been seen as controversial, saying that he does not agree with Trump 100%, rather 1000%.
Zelensky added that both the French President Macron and Merkel are not working enough to assist Ukraine.
This exchange had politicians, particularly from the opposition within Ukraine, talking on social media.
Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president, took to Twitter to say that the support provided by the EU "has been unprecedented."
In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU support provided during "Russian aggression," which included sanctions and economic aid.
Others expressed their concern, with Ukranian politician Victoria Voytsiska saying: "How could we speak to Germany and France again?"
Trump goes on to allude to military aid and asks Zelensky to investigate not one, but two claims: one into Joe Biden's son Hunter but also into the hacked DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine had some involvement in hacking into the Democrat's emails during the 2016 election.
Whether this will hinder European relations, or burn bridges with his French and German counterparts, is unclear.
I don't want to say anything bad about anyone ...
"We thank everyone who helps us," Zelensky said in New York at the UN General Assembly following the release of the phone transcript.
Zelensky is set to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany, and France in the upcoming Normandy Four summit in October.
Former voivodeship inspector finally acquitted
The court acquitted Jerzy Wisniewski of the alleged actions.
After 6 years Jerzy Wisniewski was finally acquitted.
The district court in Przemysl acquitted Jerzy Wisniewski, the former boss of Voivodeship Commerce Quality Inspectorate of Agriculture and Food Products in Rzeszów of misfeasance.
The Lublin prosecutor's office alleged him of revealing the audit date in the cooking oil production plant to the voivodeship marshal of that time.
The judgement of acquittal was recently delivered in this case.
The appeal was heard on 12th September.
As Malgorzata Reizer, Przemysl District Court spokesperson said, the court upheld the judgement of acquittal against which an appeal was made.
It is the judgement of 14th February rendered by the Przemysl District Court.
Jerzy Wisniewski commented it on Facebook in the following way: it's been six years since the Lublin Appellate Public Prosecutor's Office brought charges against me because of the alleged violation of law during my phone call with the Subcarpathia Marshal on 30th April 2012.
The Court unambiguously found that I am not guilty and did not violate the law that was in force at that time.
I was pretty sure that my phone call with the Subcarpathia Marshal was compliant with the law in force at that time.
The version of events published by media and outlined in 2013 by Appellate Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin is not true and caused irrevocable harm for the food producer as well as damaged my image among my employers, employees and within the local community.
The indictment against me was, according to the court, full of errors, false facts and unreliable legal basis that did not mirror the reality.
With the help of Central Anticorruption Bureau in Rzeszów everything was done to eradicate me from public and professional life.
I was dismissed and I lost all my financial resources.
For a long time it was only my wife who made a living.
In a nutshell:
Jerzy Wisniewski held the position of voivodeship inspector of commercial quality for agriculture and food products between 2009 and 2013.
He was dismissed after the Lublin Prosecutor's Office brought charges against him in 2013.
According to magistrates, he allegedly revealed the date of audit in the cooking oil production plant owned by the deputy Subcarpathia marshal at that time to the former voivodeship marshal in a phone call (Miroslaw Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of prison).
As argued by the prosecutor's office in Lublin, due to this warning the company owner was aware of the audit and corrected the incomplete labels on the oil bottles.
Jerzy Wisniewski was charged with misfeasance and threatened with up to 3 years of prison time.
I feel deep relief that this matter is finally reaching its end and that the court confirmed that I am not guilty.
Right from the beginning I was pretty sure I did not do anything wrong, which is now confirmed by the judgement of acquittal that frees me from any charges made, says Jerzy Wisniewski.
White House attempted to cover up record of conversation with Zelensky
In the report made available on Thursday, the whistleblower wrote that when talking to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump solicited interference from a foreign country in the U.S. elections, while the White House was trying to cover up the record of the communications.
Presidents of Ukraine and USA
In an anonymous report dated on August 12, the whistleblower, probably a member of the intelligence service, wrote: "In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,"
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelensky) to advance his personal interests.
Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president's 2020 re-election bid," says the report cited by "The Hill".
It was implied to the Ukrainian leader that his contacts with Trump depend on his "willingness to play" in matters explained to him in-depth by the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The author admits that he had not witnessed the conversation but he stresses that he learned about its content from "multiple White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call", and their accounts were consistent with one another.
"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room," we read.
"White House officials told me that they were «directed» by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored.
The transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature," wrote the author of the complaint.
"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call," assessed the whistleblower.
As commented by the AP agency, this document is likely to speed up the possible impeachment process of the president and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who might corroborate the report.
Following Congress pressure, the White House published the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky on Wednesday, however not based on the electronic record but rather on the accounts of people who had witnessed it.
A redacted version of the report was revealed a day later by the House Intelligence Committee.
Also on Thursday, Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, testified before the House Intelligence Committee and explained how he treated the report from a member of the intelligence service.
Maguire said that the whistleblower had made the right decision and acted in accordance with the law.
He stressed that, in his opinion, the conversation with Zelensky is an "unprecedented" matter.
Democrats on the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he had blocked providing the whistleblower's report to the Congress; the intelligence director responded that he did not have the authority to reveal its content because so-called executive privilege protected its confidentiality.
Part of Maguire's testimony was heard behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi informed that, due to the suspicion that the president exerted pressure on Ukrainian authorities in order to jeopardize his potential rival's chances in the upcoming presidential elections, the House of Representatives was launching an investigation which may lead to Trump's impeachment.
On the following day she assessed that the recording of Trump's conversation with Zelensky confirmed that the U.S. President broke the election and safety standards.
The U.S. electoral law forbids the use of foreign aid.
However, the Department of Justice assessed that the president had not broken the electoral law. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham argued there was nothing "inappropriate" in the conversation and the complaint "is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings."
"The White House will continue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana Wins Two ICAO Awards
Ghana has won two prestigious awards at the ongoing 40th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was in recognition of Ghana obtaining Africa's highest score in Aviation Safety Oversight after scoring a provisional Effective Implementation (EI) rate of 89.89 percent.
This was after ICAO concluded its Coordinated Validation Mission (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, in line with the United Nations Aviation Agency's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme.
The award for security was in recognition of the country's high commitment to the ICAO's recommended standards and protocols on security at the Airport and Ghana's airspace.
The awards scheme was established in support of the ICAO's No Country Left Behind initiative.
Additionally, 16 other certificates were awarded for safety and 17 certificates awarded for security to member states of ICAO who had improved upon their safety and security standards.
Present to receive the awards for Ghana was the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda; Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey; Ghana's Ambassador to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and the Managing Director of the Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President for the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, in his address stressed the need for member states to maintain safety in the aviation space.
He said "it is important for us to continue to remind ourselves that even in the era of innovation, Aviation safety, security and sustainability must remain our most fundamental priorities ."
On his part, Mr Adda remarked that the awards were great achievement to the country's efforts, as it would complement the sector's hard work and perseverance.
He further noted that the aviation sector held great potential to developing the country's economy, saying "aviation holds a lot to transform our lives.
The socioeconomic benefits are there but all comes from the safety and security which we've been able to achieve.
ZAMOŚĆ: Filled the tank, ran away and stole a bike
A 50-year old man from the community of Zamość approached his Audi to the fuel pump, filled the tank and ran away without paying.
That was the way he robbed some filling stations a few times.
The man also stole a bike outside one of the municipal offices in Zamość.
The owners of the filling stations estimated their losses to almost PLN 1 thousand.
The owner of the stolen bike – to PLN 2 thousand.
Last Tuesday one of the community policemen of Zamość noticed at Wyszyńskiego street an Audi, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
Behind the wheel there was the wanted 50-year old man.
The man was detained at a police custody.
On Thursday he faced the charges of stealing fuel from 4 filling stations and a bike.
He admitted to committing the crimes.
Unis have also found the stolen bike.
The two-wheeled vehicle will be returned to the owner.
The thief is subject to the penalty of up to 5 years in prison.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor to be FEMA chief: White House
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor smiles as he testifies before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on FEMA's FY2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.
Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post.
Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.
Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected.
He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.
Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, a Norwegian runner, considers a toe amputation
A 28-year runner has specialised in 1500 metre distances, winning a gold medal at the European Championship in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also a European vice champion at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new ailment and that he had undergone one surgery just after the Olympics in 2016, but pains came back and they aggravated badly this season.
The pain makes that I put my foot in a different way, which consequently changes my body arrangement, other unnatural loads occur and I start feeling pains in other places, for example in my hip.
For this reason I was unable to prepare sufficiently to the World Championship, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I find it difficult to put on my spiked shoes – said the runner on the air of NRK television channel.
The father and coach of the athlete, Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with his son he came to conclusion that the amputation would be the only solution for him not to finish career and take part in the next year Olympic Games in Tokyo.
It seems that this is the only solution, drastic though, and the decision has already been made.
"If a part of your body aches, you should get rid of it, and all in all, Henrik does not need the toe that much and in this case, we should forget the cosmetic aspect", he explained.
Police Shut Down Illegal Marijuana Vaping Operating In San Gabriel Valley - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police shut down an illegal marijuana vaping operation in the San Gabriel Valley Thursday.
The bust happened at about 4:37 p.m. after police conducting a warrant search for suspected illegal marijuana vape pen sales and found large jars of butane honey oil - concentrated cannabis oil - at an office building in the 9600 block of Telstar Avenue.
Lt. Christopher Cano with the El Monte Police said officers also found a machine that was used to load vape cartridges.
"The process is very dangerous," Cano said.
Cano, who used to work narcotics, said the process of distilling the oil for use in vape products is potentially flammable.
"Simple static electricity from our clothes can ignite these fumes causing not just a fire, but an explosion because it's under concentration," he said.
And if there's multiple jars and things like that, we're going to have one explosion after the next causing not just a fire, but we could possibly have a full complex taken out with the explosion.
A hazmat team was called to the vacant office to take possession of the illegal and potentially dangerous substance.
The value of the confiscated products and equipment was not immediately known.
Detectives said they received an anonymous tip that led to the search warrant where they discovered the illegal operation.
Investigators are still trying to figure out who's behind the illegal vaping operation.
They said they believe the person responsible set up shop in the office because the space was vacant.
While the investigation continues, officers said they wanted to make sure the illegal vaping products did not make it to the street, especially in the wake of recent headlines involving the dangers of vaping.
"This is just stuff that they don't even know if they're truly getting what they think that they're buying," Cano said.
This could be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
It could be very harmful to our community, to our children, so we always caution them that they should stay away from these operations.
Aphtin withdrawn form the market
GIF has made a decision on the thrush drug
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate announces a market withdrawal of an oral infection drug.
Aphtin is a drug used to treat thrush and candidiasis infections of the oral mucosa, Gram-positive bacteria infections.
It can be applied as a backup to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product has been withdrawn because of product odour incompliance with quality specifications and a reduction in the active substance content.
The product has been withdrawn upon request by Laboratorium Galenowe from Olsztyn.
Each month GIF on average issues a few decisions on market withdrawal for particular product series.
The series of drugs whose commercial circulation in Poland is currently suspended can be relaunched after submitting evidence for its safety.
When the drug is completely withdrawn, it will be impossible to relaunch it.

The date on the banknote, 25th January 2019, is the 100th anniversary of establishing Polish Security Printing Works.
It is also the nominal value, PLN 19, that refers to the year of establishment, the NBP message continues.
The watermark presents the eagle image from the first Polish banknote issued in PWPW after Polish regained its independence.
A new element is a holographic stripe on the window in the bottom.
On the front side you can see the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and near the inscription "Independence" the stylish Order of the White eagle image can be found.
This inscription, coming from Józef Pilsludski manuscript, is the logotype of the 100th anniversary of Polish independence.
The security feature developed by PWPW, Umbra4Note, was incorporated into the branch of laurel, serving as a symbol of brotherhood and victory, which is a very special form of a finishing touch.
The reverse side of the banknote shows the contemporary image of the Works against the background of modern-day Warsaw.
Next to it there is the SPARK Live security feature incorporated into the PWPW logotype as well as an opalescent stripe that can be also seen against the UV light as a sequence of the number "19" and the abbreviation "NBP", the description continues.
On 2nd of October 55 thousand banknotes will be put into circulation.
One banknote will cost PLN 80.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including the special series, are a legal tender in Poland.
However. their possible collection value greatly exceeds the nominal value.
A new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, i.e. for more than PLN two million, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was carried on a special platform to the Easton port, where it was loaded onto a barge.
From there it went 50 miles on the river.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
The Chairman of the Law and Justice Party, Jarosław Kaczyński, will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska in the upcoming election.
"Please do the same", he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński together with Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for the banner photo of the Law and Justice candidate.
On Friday, Warsaw's third candidate on the list boasted in social media that she would get Kaczyński's vote in a parliamentary election.
"The Chairman of the Law and Justice party, Prime Minister, Jarosław Kaczyński endorses Małgorzata Gosiewska," we can read on her Facebook profile.
The Chairman of the party stated that she is sensitive, emotional and always willing to help.
"I will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska and please do the same," he appeals.
Gosiewska is a candidate for the Sejm from the 19th constituency (Warsaw), she is third on the list.
The first on the list is Kaczyński himself, the second is Mariusz Kamiński.
Christmas Book Fair is coming
Meetings with famous writers and books at exceptional prices are waiting for visitors.

Elizabeth I's lost dress to go on display at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest chamblet silk, woven with strips of beaten silver, and had been exquisitely embroidered in a rich pattern of plants, beasts and butterflies.
To Eleri Lynn, curator of the dress collection at Historic Royal Palaces, that meant only one thing.
The faded piece of fabric she was looking at, hanging on the wall of a tiny rural parish church where it had been placed 100 years earlier, could only be a lost piece of clothing from the wardrobe of Elizabeth I.
Three years after Lynn stumbled across the sumptuous fabric, which had been used as an altar cloth in the church in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress is to go on display next month at Hampton Court palace, close to the very rooms where the Tudor queen may well have worn it more than 450 years ago.
It is a measure of the importance of the discovery that in the entire royal dress collection, only one other item of 16th-century dress survives.
And while there is no cast iron proof that the dress was once worn by Elizabeth, three years of scholarship have only strengthened experts' conviction that the dress must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Cloth of silver," a fantastically expensive fabric, was by law reserved only for the most senior members of the royal household, while the "virtuoso" quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later supplemented by stags and dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear, also points to the loftiest of previous owners.
The gown, at the time it was made, would have cost the equivalent of a Tudor mansion.
In addition, said Lynn, in the 1590s, late in Elizabeth's reign, she had grown threatened by other women at court and would not have tolerated rivals wearing such exquisite fabric.
It's a big thing to say, so I have had lots of peer reviewers come and have a look at it.
And it has always been really gratifying that when they see it they have a "wow" moment too, and leave quite convinced that we are looking at an item of royal dress."
The long second life of the dress panel, recut to serve as an altar cloth in the obscure church of St Faith's, Bacton, is not quite so unexpected as it might appear.
Bacton was the home hamlet of Blanche Parry, the closest of Elizabeth's maids of honour who served the queen throughout her long life, and local legend has long associated the textile with Parry.
Though the dress postdates her death in 1590, experts believe Elizabeth must have given it to the Parry family or the parish in Blanche's memory, before her own death in 1603.
After more than 1,000 hours of conservation, 400 of them spent in the most delicate handstitching using specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, the altar cloth will go on display next to the "Rainbow portrait," one of the most celebrated contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, which shows her dressed in a similar gown and which has been loaned by Hatfield House for the duration of the exhibition.
"When you're working with historic textiles you gain a real respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made them," said Libby Thompson, who led the conservation, much of which took place in a converted greenhouse in the Hampton Court grounds - the only space large enough to house some of the palace's priceless tapestries.
Looking at the embroidery, on the front and the back, it's given me a massive respect for those who made it.
I have never worked on anything that's quite so elite.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth opens on 12 October at Hampton Court Palace
Fitch affirms the stability rating of Poland
Fitch affirmed the long-term foreign currency rating for Poland at the "A-" level, the message says.
The rating perspective remains stable.
The Fitch Agency emphasizes strong macroeconomic conditions and well diversified economy, supported by reasonable economy politics and strong banking sector, Ministry of Finance message says.
As argued, Fitch noted that Poland is at the peak of its business cycle and the real Gross Domestic Product growth rate in the period between 2019 and 2021 will amount to 4,1 per cent, 3,3 per cent and 2,9 per cent respectively.
According to the agency's forecasts, the deficit level of the government and self-government sector in relation to GDP in 2020-2021 will be less than 3 per cent, 2,3 per cent and 1,9 per cent respectively.
The debt ratio of the government and self-government sector in relation to GDP in 2019 is going to be 50,5 per cent, likely to fall in the next years (48,3 per cent on average between 2020 and 2021), as the message continues.
Poland's rating
On 11th October the autumn edition of Poland's rating review will be finished by S&P and Moody's.
According to Fitch, Poland's rating remains the same as the one issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time the Agency confirmed Poland's rating at the level of "A-" with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest rating agencies Poland received the highest score from Moody's (A2).
According to Fitch and S&P Poland's rating is "A-", which is one level lower.
All ratings boast stable perspectives.
What is a rating?
Rating agencies were established to help investors evaluate the risk of their investments.
It is companies, banks and countries that are subject to rating.
In case of the latter every rating has an influence on the economy attractiveness.
Rating is simply an evaluation of creditworthiness.
On its basis decisions can be made who can borrow money and at what costs.
Sometimes such information tells us to whom no credit should be granted, as there is a great risk that the money will not be paid back.
Lower rating implies greater risk.
But then higher risk implies bigger credit interest.
Every evaluation must be justified and well-argued.
Rating gives a room for manipulation, however in this case agencies risk the loss of reputation.
As for now, more than 90% of world's rating services market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them has its own evaluation system.
"The Confederation Five": First of all, 1,000 plus
"The Confederation Five", i.e. the main assumptions of the electoral program, was presented in Koszalin on Friday by Polish Sejm candidates from constituency 40, competing for a mandate from the Liberty and Independence Confederation electoral committee.
Leader of the Koszalin Sejm list, Krzysztof Chmielewski, presented the "Confederation Five" slogans.
"Firstly – 1,000 plus for Poland; secondly – quick and just courts; thirdly – a culture voucher and an education voucher; fourthly – national security; fifthly – a healthy life," says Chmielewski.
He stressed that "Poles finally need to start earning good money", which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "this will automatically solve the problem of income tax threshold."
"Poles should be given a choice as to where they want to save their money for retirement, which means a zero PIT and voluntary social insurance for everyone", said the leader of the list about the assumptions behind the "1,000 plus program for Poland."
Meanwhile, number two on the list Aleksandra Zadencka, when commenting on the "healthy life" program slogan, said that "the quality of food is deteriorating" and, in order to change this, we should "support Polish farmers and Polish agriculture" as well as opt for GMO-free crop.
She added that the Confederation also supports stopping "the stigmatization of hemp."
Zadencka declared the Confederation's support for "the development of construction using natural materials."
She also spoke in favour of "voluntary vaccination" on behalf of her party.
"The right to informed consent cannot be broken," she added.
Other parliamentary candidates from the Koszalin constituency stressed that the Confederation is in favour of "deep judicial reforms", which would include judging cases "day by day".
They also argued that the educational subsidy should reach schools without the intermediation of local authorities, i.e., as they argue, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also for "a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers."
Sejm candidates stressed the need to increase the number of soldiers in the army.
They believe in easier access to weapons.
In economic terms, they underscored the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gasify coal, we have vast deposits of geothermal energy; we should also consider revisiting the idea of a nuclear power plant," said Piotr Karpiński, fifth on the list.
Mexican cartel boss behind one-third of drugs in the U.S.
Chicago - Just after sunrise on Chicago's West Side, CBS News watched the morning rush for drugs.
Brian McKnight with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) showed what was going on in broad daylight.
Last year in Chicago, almost 800 people died from drug overdoses.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago are coming from Mexico.
The DEA is focused on a Mexican drug lord named Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"He is the number one priority for DEA and frankly for federal law enforcement in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's top agent in Mexico.
A bounty for El Mencho is up to $10 million.
He has helped uncover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
El Mencho's Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of the drugs entering the U.S. by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has trafficked "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl-laced heroin.
El Mencho has a $10 million bounty on his head.
Ironically, he lived in California some 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported back to Mexico.
That's where he started the violent cartel.
He has got an enormous amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.
He basically has his own SWAT teams," Donahue said.
From shooting down a Mexican Army helicopter, killing six, to being implicated in a public hanging this summer, El Mencho protects his empire with impunity.
Cartel violence has led to thousands of murders in recent years.
According to statistics from the Mexican government, there are approximately 94 homicides per day.
Back in Chicago, the Mexican drugs seized are so toxic, they can't be handled without protective gear.
At the lab, packs of cocaine are stamped with trafficker brands.
More than a third can be traced back to El Mencho's cartel.
"He is the one that is responsible for sending the poison that is actually killing innocent women and kids," Donahue said.
So, when someone's child dies, Donahue said there's "a good chance" those drugs came from El Mencho's organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from an overdose.
France: President of France and wife blackmailed by 27-year old
A 27-year old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the First Lady, says the French prosecutor's office.
The defendant ensures he is in possession of documents discrediting the presidential pair.
He demanded €300 thousand in cash from the head of the state.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to be a police officer in France says that he received "explosive" documents from a person employed at the Elysée Palace.
During the interrogation he explained that not only do these documents discredit the presidential pair, but revealing all of them could put the safety of Macron and the First Lady at risk.
In exchange for their return, he demanded €300 thousand and an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from her former marriage about this.
According to the prosecutor's office, the defendant refused to hand over the said documents to the police.
He promised he would hand them over to the media; however, so far nobody knows if the documents in fact exist.
They were not found during the search of the 27-year old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric evaluation, but the doctors did not state any serious disorders.
PS4 game goes old-school, as Sony reveals surprise PlayStation 4 news
Sony has shed more light on upcoming PS4 exclusive The Last of Us: Part Two.
As part of Sony's recent State of Play presentation, Sony announced a February 2020 release date for the Last of Us sequel.
Fans were also treated to some breathtaking new gameplay footage of the upcoming action game.
Even more details have been announced in the days since the big Last of Us 2 gameplay reveal.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are taking it back to the old-school in more ways than one.
Something we haven't seen very often since the PSOne era, The Last of Us: Part 2 will ship on multiple discs.
Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann confirmed as much in an excellent interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"This story is ambitious and complex in ways that the first one wasn't," he said.
And it needed to be that big to tell this kind of story with this many characters.
We didn't set out to make the biggest game ever, it just kind of evolved that way.
"We got excited by how much this story has to offer, and there's going to be moments where you'll think you're getting to the end and you'll realise it was just the opening part and it's opened up to this whole other section," Druckmann continues.
It's so ambitious the game doesn't fit on one BluRay, it's on two discs.
Elsewhere, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two not safe for work Easter eggs (via Gamespot).
While we won't ruin the surprise here, the in-game Easter eggs include references to old-school Naughty Dog releases.
You can find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two launches exclusively for PS4 on February 21, 2020.
PS4 owners can prepare for the release of the sequel by picking up The Last of Us Remastered with PS Plus.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 games for October 2019, which includes the aforementioned Naughty Dog release.
MLB The Show 19 will also be available for PS Plus subscribers in October.
If you enjoy The Last of Us Remastered and want to pre-order the sequel, Sony has announced multiple editions of the game, including a bumper version containing a replica of Ellie's backpack, her bracelet and a 12-inch statue of the iconic character.
Run, Pull and Fight – Sport
On Saturday, first-league Stomil will welcome Podbeskidzie and feels like winning.
Stomil players have been invincible for three rounds.
The trainees of Piotr Zajączkowski have received seven points during that period, as they won with Stal Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, with the goalless draw in Suwałki during the most recent game.
Now the team from Olsztyn is welcoming Podbeskidzie, mentioned as one of favourites for promotion to Ekstraklasa at 6.00 p.m. on Saturday.
The nearest rivals of Stomil take the fourth place in the table and are one point better than the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskidzie has played away six times this season and has got two victories, draws and failures. Stomil, however, plays extremely well on its own stadium as the team of Piotr Zajączkowski has already won three times and failed once in the facility at al. Piłsudskiego 69a.
During the ten rounds, the players from Olsztyn won 17 points and lead the table, although nothing foreshadowed that following two failures at the start of the games.
"All changes need time to bring about results", Piotr Skiba explains.
"And, eventually, something is up to snuff, we started to believe in ourselves, and we can work in normal conditions.
We focused solely on playing football.
There are clear heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do as we have a strong training team".
On Tuesday, the players from Stomil eliminated Ruch Chorzów from the Polish Cup, but they needed a play-off and a penalty shot series to do it.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland as the coach Zajączkowski gave those key players some time to relax before the Saturday encounter with Podbeskidzie.
However, Jakub Mosakowski, returning after an injury, played in Chorzów and scored his long-awaited goal.
"It is always great to score a goal, but I managed to do it in time to ensure we can still play in the cups (Mosakowski reached a 3:3 draw in 119th minute — ed.).
My father often needled me and laughed I was unable to score a goal, but I would always tell him I would score when no one expects it."
Now Mosakowski hopes for returning to the basic line-up, even more so as Oleh Tarasenko cannot play because of yellow cards.
"I rush off my feet during workouts to play in the first team", says Mosakowski.
"In Chorzów I did everything to show myself.
However, no matter if I play or sit in the dugout, I will support the team equally strong.
What matters most is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskidzie.
This is going to be a tough meeting where you need to run, pull and fight for the victory."
Rafał Remisz, who has been injured recently, can also play in the middle defense, meaning we will learn whether he plays or not only on Saturday, even more so as the coach Zajączkowski tries to keep the team composition secret till the very end as usual.
A man raped and killed his niece
"You’ll never see daylight again"
You’ll never breathe fresh air again", said judge Kevin K. Allen addressing to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison", he added.
The 5-year Lizzy disappeared in May.
The search for her was going on for five days until Whipple showed the place of hiding the body.
"How somebody was able to do this to his own niece?, asked Dejay Smith, girl’s uncle.
"You are the worst person the human race can offer", he said to Alex Whipple.
"I would give everything to meet her again, and give her a hug", said the mother of the killed girl.
"Our life will never be the same again", added the devastated women.
As Fox News announces, 22-year Whipple did not show any emotion during interrogation.
Last month he admitted that he had kidnapped, sexually abused and killed the girl.
The man’s lawyer said that his client had been raised in an "imperfect family".
He was supposed to be sexually harassed as a child.
He also added that Whipple was aware that he had committed an awful deed and was prepared to be punished.
The man was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced almost $100 million of extra assistance for drought-affected communities.
A program delivering cash payments to drought-affected farmers will be extended, and the farm household allowance will be overhauled to make it simpler.
The package includes almost $34 million for the Drought Community Support Initiative allowing eligible households access to up to $3000 in emergency payments.
Up to 13 local government areas will each be provided with up to $1 million in infrastructure and drought relief grants under the Drought Community Programme.
The new support package comes on top of more than $7 billion in drought support funding already provided by the government.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
documentary: The number of divorces in China has doubled in the last decade.
This was generally due to third parties.
Increasingly more men are maintaining relations outside of marriage, which has led to the development of a special sector in the country – that of professional mistress busters, whose task is to save the marriages of wives who are being cheated on.
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-usz!
Rehearsal for greeting the prime minister in Piekary Śląskie
A peculiar dry run was conducted before the electoral meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekary Śląskie.
"Ladies and gentlemen, louder, louder, this is not how we'll greet the prime minister here!
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-usz!", the person in charge encouraged everyone persistently.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic MC did not return the expected result.
Election campaign under way.
Politicians travel around the country trying to win the support of voters.
Mateusz Morawiecki, who is a frequent guest in the region as the leader of the Silesian Law and Justice party, is also running an intensive campaign.
Each meeting is planned carefully, including the proper setting.
This was, or rather should have been, the case in Piekary Śląskie as well.
Surely, a special guest calls for a special greeting.
Before meeting the prime minister, the person in charge present in the room decided to do a dry run.
Like a consummate master of ceremony, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the government leader.
"This won't be a welcome for me, but for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
So let's be louder, my dear friends!", he encouraged in enthusiasm.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not gripped by the MC's fervent urges and responded "Ma-te-usz" reluctantly, but the recording of the enthusiastic MC is viral online.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man convicted of killing his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted in the 2014 killings of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
Authorities said he entered the Stays' home on July 9, 2014, demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, Melannie Haskell.
She was not there, but her sister, Katie Stay, and her family were.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys, ages 13 and 4, and two girls, ages 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.
Only one member of the family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
Authorities at the time indicated she was critically wounded, though she later made a full recovery.
Jurors on Thursday unanimously rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's insanity defense.
The jury was dismissed until Monday for sentencing.
Quantum internet closer to reality -- ScienceDaily
A U.S. Army research result brings the quantum internet a step closer.
Such an internet could offer the military security, sensing and timekeeping capabilities not possible with traditional networking approaches.
The U.S. Army's Combat Capability Development's Army Research Laboratory's Center for Distributed Quantum Information, funded and managed by the lab's Army Research Office, saw researchers at the University of Innsbruck achieve a record for the transfer of quantum entanglement between matter and light -- a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.
Entanglement is a correlation that can be created between quantum entities such as qubits.
When two qubits are entangled and a measurement is made on one, it will affect the outcome of a measurement made on the other, even if that second qubit is physically far away.
"This [50 kilometers] is two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and is a practical distance to start building inter-city quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at University of Innsbruck and the principal investigator for the project, whose findings are published in the Nature journal Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would be composed of distant network nodes of physical qubits, which are, despite the large physical separation, nevertheless entangled.
This distribution of entanglement is essential for establishing a quantum internet, researchers said.
"The demonstration is a major step forward for achieving large scale distributed entanglement," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-manager of the Army program supporting the research.
The quality of the entanglement after traveling through fiber is also high enough at the other end to meet some of the requirements for some of the most difficult quantum networking applications.
The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, the researchers wrote a quantum state onto the ion and simultaneously excited it to emit a photon in which quantum information is stored.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the light particle were entangled.
The challenge is to transmit the photon over fiber optic cables.
"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the optical fiber," Lanyon said.
His team therefore initially sent the light particle through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser.
The photon wavelength was converted to the optimal value for long-distance travel -- the current telecommunications standard wavelength of 1,550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through the 50-kilometer-long optical fiber line.
Their measurements show that atom and light particles were still entangled even after the wavelength conversion and the distance traveled.
"The choice to use calcium means these results also provide a direct path to realizing an entangled network of atomic clocks over a large physical distance, since calcium can be co-trapped with a high quality "clock" qubit.
Large scale entangled clock networks are of great interest to the Army for precision position, navigation, and timing applications," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, an Army researcher who also co-manages the program.
