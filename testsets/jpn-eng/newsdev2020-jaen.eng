Bosnians protest Croatian plans for nuclear waste facility
Hundreds of people rallied Friday in northwest Bosnia against plans by neighboring Croatia to store part of the waste from the region's only nuclear plant near its border with Bosnia and a main river known for its natural beauty.
The protesters in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad urged Croatia to abandon plans for a storage site at a former army barracks in Trgovska Gora and pledged to fight the project.
The facility would hold waste from the Krsko nuclear plant.
Holding banners reading "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - the Una (river) needs us," Bosnians they said a nuclear waste facility could endanger the Una River and the lives of around 250,000 area residents.
We have to say NO!
Miroslav Drljaca, the head of Novi Grad municipality told the crowd.
We must fight to preserve our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the 1980s" Krsko plant is owned jointly by Croatia.
Officials from the two countries are set to meet next week to discuss additional waste storage facilities.
Croatia's state HRT television reported Friday that Croatia was yet to decide whether it would build storage of its own or pay to store its share of waste at a new facility Slovenia is building.
Croatian Minister of Environment Protection and Energy Tomislav Coric told the broadcaster that Croatia also has a problem disposing of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and was hoping to find an overall solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country nearer to the nuclear.
"How come that out of entire Croatia, the best is the Trgovska Gora pocket that is in Bosnia's pants?" asked Drljaca.
We must not let them humiliate us!

PayPay salesperson: "We're just riding the wave", the switch to cashless payments sees a rush of adopters, but will this wave turn into a swell? (Tokai Television) - Yahoo!News
The sales tax will be going up in October.
Accompanying this, the government will also begin the "Cashless Point Rebate Program".
To counter the cooling of consumer spending, shoppers can get a rebate of up to 5%, but the condition is that they have to have paid with a cashless payment method.
View in images: Shortly before the tax increase...Shops and businesses rush to adopt cashless payments
As a result, there is a rush to adopt cashless payments.
Stores that up until now only accepted cash are going cashless.
We had a look at on location at a store introducing cashless payments.
A rush before the tax increase... Shops and businesses are going cashless
A confectionery store "Okakiya Tatsushin", in Chita, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular store run by Takeshin Confectionery, with over 100 kinds of roasted mochi balls and strips lining its shelves.
Today, Tatsushin is being visited by Ms. Yasuda from the smartphone payment service PayPay, which already boasts 12.5 million users.
Ms. Yasuda (PayPay): "Do you currently accept any payment methods other than cash?"
Ms. Niimi (President of Takeshin Confectionery): "No, we're quite old-fashioned and only accept cash... "
Ms. Yasuda: "Some of the benefits of PayPay include the fact that you don't need to hand over change, so you should appreciate a faster turnaround at the tills, plus when you get used to it I think you might find it easier than cash."
PayPay has been running a ten billion yen campaign in which users receive 20% of the price they pay back as points.
This approach has earnt them an explosive increase in the number of users, but Ms. Yasuda is a salesperson to the places where those users will use the payment method, in other words, she is selling the PayPay system to shops.
Okakiya Tatsushin had been a cash-only business up until now.
On listening to Yasuda's sales pitch, President Niimi also decided to join PayPay.
Ms. Yasuda: "I'm really busy, and I think it's probably at its peak right now. Places that I've called into before that wouldn't let me talk to them now think that if we help them with the consumer rebate program, then they'd like to hear about PayPay, and I usually get them to sign up as a participating store, so I pretty much feel like I'm riding the wave right now."
- Riding the "cashless wave" with the government's consumer rebate program!
The reason Ms. Yasuda gave for feeling like she was riding on a wave is the government's consumer rebate program.
The government will raise sales taxes in October, and to counter the anticipated cooling of consumer spending, they are implementing a program in which customers will get a rebate of up to 5% of the purchase amount, on the condition that they paid with a cashless payment method.
Therefore, many small to medium-sized retailers are considering adopting cashless payments before the taxes are raised, just like Okakiya Tatsushin.

What is Munchhausen's by proxy mentioned in The Politician on Netflix?
The condition means carers or parents pretend their child is ill when they are healthy.
The Politican hits Netflix today.
The show tells the story of Payton Hobart who wants to be President of the United States of America - but first, he has to be student body president at his high school.
Made by American Horror Story and Glee creator Ryan Murphy, it features Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too much for those who haven't had a chance to watch it yet, the show includes a storyline about Munchhausen's by proxy - a mental illness where a carer acts as if the person they are looking after has a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick.
There are different types of the condition, including Munchhausen's where a person pretends that they themselves are ill.
Munchhausen's By Proxy, however, is specifically about making up that someone that you care for is ill.
It is also known as fabricated or induced illness (FII) and is categorised as child abuse.
It is a rare condition and usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it seem like their child is ill.
What are the signs of Munchhausen's by proxy?
The signs of the condition can vary from case to case but the NHS says that things to be aware of include:
Persuading medical professionals that their child is unwell but they seem healthy.
Exaggerating or lying about symptoms.
Manipulating results to suggest the child is ill, for example putting glucose in urine samples to make it look like they have diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of illness, for example giving them unnecessary medication or other substances.
How common is Munchhausen's by proxy?
As many cases aren't reported, it's difficult to know how widespread the condition is.
One study published in 2000 estimated 89 cases in a population of 100,000 over a two year period.
What should you do if you think a child is at risk
You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police Raid Kaduna School, Evacuate 300 Children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police Command yesterday raided a school, Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal, located at Layin Maidubun Tsumma at Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of the state, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police alleged that the children were kept in a very dehumanising condition; an allegation the school authority denied.
A resident who identified himself as Shehu, a preacher in the school, said: "What they're saying is not true because all the children are there with the consent of their parents.
The parents signed a form before the children were enrolled in the school.
The parents used to bring food to their children daily and they also know the condition they are in.
We were very surprised when the police came and evacuated the children as well as removed all the students' food brought by their parents before they shut down the school.
This is unfair because we have parents to testify if their children are kept in bad conduction as claimed by the police.
He added that the immediate past Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to see how the children were taken care, never complained.
‎He said the children only studied Quran and nothing else.
But the Police Command Public Relations Officer, Yakubu Sabo, said the children would be reunited with their parents after handing them over to the state government.
"They were kept in dehumanising condition in the name of undergoing or acquiring Quranic knowledge.
With many of them with scars on their back which show they were beaten.
So, we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility," he said.
Foreign talent important to China's development
Guangdong has been leading the country in terms of attracting foreign talent, due in a large part to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and Shenzhen's new role as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group has interviewed seven expatriates aged from 10-70 in Guangdong.
Born in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, Yash from Singapore said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientific doctor in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student of Shenzhen MSU-BIT University said, "With the BRI, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
We can make new ideas and businesses together.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the US started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over one million fans on Bilibili and Weibo.
She said she will keep sharing Chinese traditions, culture and technology through her videos.
Leticia de Lassus from France, the head of JJB International Montessori AMI Centers in Guangzhou, agrees that "children's education is like buttoning up one's jacket.
If the first button is fastened incorrectly, the rest will never find their rightful place.
Chinese-American Henry Xiao believes that at the heart of GBA, his company can enjoy multiple benefits in terms of new policies, government policies and capitals, especially the talent.
Nanta Show producer Sean Choi from South Korea said Guangdong cuisine is famous all over the world, and it has been good to introduce the Nanta Show to Guangdong.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland, the technical quality director at the Pearl River Pianos, thinks the secret of high quality lies in simple work done well.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China enjoy working, learn to make good products and persist in their drive to be better.
Showing consideration for sexual minorities, Mie removes gender section from prefectural high school applications: Hokkaido Shimbun Newspaper Doshin Online Edition
On the 28th it was established that Mie Prefecture Board of Education has made the decision to remove the gender section from prefecture high school applications, a move that was made in consideration of transgender pupils and other sexual minorities whose mental and physical genders do not match.
In the 2018 academic year, the board had already changed the gender section of entrance examinations from a selection to a field for students to fill in themselves, also permitting it to be left blank, but from 2020, they will do away with this section altogether.
They will instead use questionnaires filled in at junior high schools to allocate classes and determine groups for physical education.
However, these questionnaires will likewise gutter the gender selection in favour of a field for students to fill in themselves, giving students the freedom to enter their own personal circumstances.
According to school boards across the nation, Osaka and Fukuoka prefectures have already removed the gender section from public high school applications in 2019, with Hokkaido and Kanagawa Prefecture set to follow suit in 2020.

[20 years old Sabalenka in the top 10 for the first time]
On this day, Sablenka, the winner of last year's tournament, gained points from first serves, with a 75% probability.
She won in 1 hour 43 minutes, breaking for 3 times the service game by world's number one ranked Barty, who racked up 8 double faults.
The Women's Association of Tennis Professionals, WTA, posted a comment by Sabalenka on their official website.

'Hideous' Central Coast camouflage child rapist ordered to look at victim in court
Dressed in a leafy Ghillie camouflage suit, the man grabbed the then 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into bushland as she made her way to school on the state's Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the grooming and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife.
When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.
The man told the girl: "Shhh, don't scream.
Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lashing her to the tree and abusing her for almost an hour.
After he cut her loose, the girl ran crying hysterically to school.
The man arrived at work about 9.30am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues.
With dirt, grass and tree matter on his clothes, he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday.
Pope warns tech execs to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.
Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.
The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.
In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor.
But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.
"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned.
If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants' expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.
Nagano's surprise performance, stepping into the box to G Abe's walk-up music.
Thank you very much, my mentor.

Martin Odegaard, Real Madrid Loanee, Sends Fans Wild With Mind-Boggling Assist.
Martin Odegaard provided a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener.
Real Madrid went top of the La Liga table following their 2-0 win over Osasuna as they continued their unbeaten run in this year's domestic season.
However, despite not losing a single game in La Liga this season, manager Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure following a tumultuous pre-season and a public rift with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The pressure seemed to reach the boiling point when Real Madrid were humiliated by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG) in the Champions League.
But Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have some real talent on their books, some who are currently in the Frenchman's plans and those that aren't.
Vinícius Junior is one such star for the future for Real Madrid and is currently with the team.
However, another Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard, who has been loaned out to Real Sociedad, is creating a flutter after providing a mind-boggling assist during a La Liga match.
Playing for Real Sociedad vs Alaves, Martin Odegaard provided a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener as Real Sociedad ran out 3-0 winners at home.
After picking the ball up on the right, Martin Odegaard drifted away from one opponent by nutmegging him and then threaded a stunning pass inside two more for his teammate to get at the of the inch-perfect through-ball and poke home.
Willian Jose's second and a third from the impressive Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty spot, secured a convincing win for Imanol's side, before Alaves midfielder Manu Garcia was sent off with five minutes to play.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid aged just 16 in 2015 but has struggled to live up to the hype.
Now 20, the Norwegian youngster finally appears to be finding his feet.
Anna Hazare Surprised Sharad Pawar's Name Figures In Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Scam Case
Anna Hazare said "Sharad Pawar's name was not on the list when this case came to me"
Social activist Anna Hazare has expressed surprise over Nationalist Congress Party or NCP chief Sharad Pawar's name cropping up in the multi-crore Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank scam.
Probe agency Enforcement Directorate or ED has filed a money laundering case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar - a former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra - and others in connection with the scam.
An Enforcement Case Information Report, equivalent to a police FIR, has been registered by the central agency under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on a Mumbai Police FIR which had named former chairmen of the bank, Ajit Pawar, and 70 erstwhile functionaries of the cooperative lender.
When this case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was not there anywhere.
How did his name crop up, who mentioned his name, all these things only they know," Anna Hazare said on Thursday when asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged links to the scam.
Anna Hazare, a Sharad Pawar critic, expressed the hope that the truth will come out after the ED carries out a detailed investigation in the scam.
"The ED will come to know how his name figured in the case," said Anna Hazare, a veteran of many anti-corruption agitations.
Sharad Pawar has denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was not associated with the bank in any capacity and questioned the timing of the registration of the case which comes just weeks ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls in Maharashtra.
The former Union minister has asserted he would not bow before the "throne" of Delhi, apparently referring to the BJP-led government at the Centre.
The NCP has termed the Enforcement Directorate case as politically motivated.
South Africa: Man, 20, Charged With Murder of Ukzn Student Sinethemba Ndlovu
A man who was arrested in connection with the murder of University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) student Sinethemba Ndlovu is expected to apply for bail next week, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).
The accused appeared in the Msinga Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.
KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara told News24 that the case was postponed to October 2 for the bail application.
She added that the State would oppose the accused's release on bail.
According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the 20-year-old accused was arrested on Monday.
Ndlovu was stabbed below her left armpit and stomach, police said earlier this week.
It's believed that she worked as a hostess at the Msinga Driftkhana motorsport event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued that day, organisers of the motorsport event said preliminary reports suggested that a few hostesses remained behind after the event to watch some of the musical performances after their shift ended.
On their way, sadly, one of them was attacked by unknown men and later passed [a]way in hospital," their statement read.
UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, saying "the circumstances of Ndlovu's death requires us as a community to pause and reflect on the fragility of life, and the brutality that often exists in our society."

Mylan agrees to pay $30M in EpiPen settlement
Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million in a settlement tied to its failure to tell investors about a Justice Department investigation into whether the company overcharged Medicaid for the EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that Mylan NV classified the EpiPen as a "generic" drug under the Medicaid drug rebate program.
This led to the pharmaceutical company paying much lower rebates to the government than if the EpiPen had been classified as a "branded" drug.
Mylan had disclosed in July that it had reached an agreement-in-principle with the SEC on the matter.
The company said in a statement Friday that it neither admits nor denies the SEC's allegations.
Eliminate stepping on the accelerator by accident!
4 sudden start prevention devices that can be retrofitted (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
You can buy peace of mind for surprisingly reasonable prices
Traffic accidents caused by driver error.
Above all else, accidents caused by elderly drivers accidently pressing the accelerator instead of the breaks have begun to increase.
They especially panic when the car suddenly starts moving, and keep stepping on the accelerator while thinking they are stepping on the brake pedal.
New vehicles with safe driving functions that can correct such driver errors have been appearing, and there are also devices that can be retrofit onto vehicles that don't have these functions equipped.
The sudden start prevention system these after production parts makers sell.
We'd like to introduce a few to show what kind of features they have.
Stepping on both accelerator and break because distance between them is narrow
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The e-ACCEL ALARM, developed by Pivot, notifies you of pedal stepping mistakes in a new way.
It sounds an alarm if the wrong pedal is stepped on.
The mechanism is such that, an alarm is sound when the accelerator is pressed more than necessary, when mistaking it for the break while driving slowly or stopping.
The sound notifies the driver to ease back on the accelerator and avoid speeding up by quickly recognizing the wrong step.
It is also effective for elderly drivers who are unable to hear the change in engine sounds when they step on the accelerator by accident.
Insert it into the OBDII connector and the body sticks with double-sided tape.
The price is reasonable at 9800 yen (excluding tax) and the no installation simplicity is appealing.
[Ashimoto Mimamoru-kun] World Wing launched an accelerator/break mistake prevention device called "Ashimoto Mimamoru-kun" in mid-September.
It support not just forward movement, but also backwards.
When the accelerator is suddenly pressed when moving forward or backward while stopping (or driving at less than 10Km/h) it detects the vehicle’s speed signal and brake signal and suppresses the sudden start by electronically controlling the accelerator.
If you accidentally step on the accelerator it won't transmit the signal from the accelerator and instead instantly turn to creep drive (Brake released in the D range) which controls the sudden start.
It also detects the speed of the vehicle going backwards above 5 km/h and has the function to force switch the vehicle to creep mode.
Installation is possible with just a coupler and some simple wiring.
The main unit is 37000 yen (excluding tax).

New Tapioca Drink Stores Open at Chuo 1-chome, Fukui
A review of the city's third sector that was carried out by the Fukui town planning council has revealed that the current number of vacant stores in Fukui's Chuo 1-chome is 39 as of the end of August, down seven in the six months since March.
A number of stores specialising in tapioca drinks opening in quick succession has led to the reduction of vacant stores.
The situation has improved to a level just behind that of February 2016, when the "Beauty Town Project" that invited people to set up shops on the theme of beauty, and other renovation works, were especially active.
The review only considered stores at street level.
Fifteen new stores have appeared in the six months since the last review, with 12 of them opening in previously vacant stores.
Meanwhile, five stores have become vacant due to closures.
There are 320 stores in total, and the vacancy rate is 12.2%, down 1.9 points from the previous review.
Of the 15 new stores, five specialise in serving tapioca drinks.
Since June, they have sprung up in locations such as Kitanosho-dori Street and Fukui Ekimae Minami-dori Street.
According to the Fukui town planning council, more tapioca drink stores have appeared in once vacant stores on Fukui Ekimae Densha-dori Street since the review was carried out.
A source attached to the review said, "While the initial fervor that saw long queues even on weekdays has calmed down, you still see plenty of women walking down the street, tapioca in hand."
A look at areas where redevelopment is planned reveals four new stores (two of them tapioca drink stores) and one store closure.
According to the council's investigations, the number of vacant stores in Chuo 1-chome was at the highest in August 2010, with 78 vacant stores (a vacancy rate of 20.3%).
After that, the situation improved and the number of vacant stores was stable around 40 from February 2016 onwards, but rose to 46 in February of this year.
Mother pleads guilty to murdering two teenage sons
A woman broke down in tears as she was told she could spend the rest of her life in prison after admitting murdering her two teenage sons while conspiring to kill four more of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35, pleaded guilty to the murder of Tristan Barrass, 13, and Blake Barrass, 14.
The brothers died in hospital 12 minutes apart after police were called to the Shiregreen area of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, at about 7.30am on 24 May.
Postmortems have been carried out but the results were not given during a hearing on Friday at Sheffield crown court.
The exact circumstances surrounding the boys' deaths are not yet known.
Barrass appeared in the dock alongside her co-defendant, Brandon Machin, 39, a family member.
Flanked by three security officers, they pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to murder six children.
The pair also pleaded guilty to five counts of attempted murder during the 20-minute hearing.
The conspiracy to murder charges relate to a period between 14 and 20 May.
Four of the attempted murder charges relate to four children, including Blake and Tristan on 23 May.
The fifth count of attempted murder took place on 24 May.
The surviving children are all under the age of 13.
The judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, told the pair: "No words of mine can ever fully reflect the enormity of what you have both done.
The crimes you have committed quite frankly speak for themselves.
The murder of two children.
The attempted murder of four children and the overarching conspiracy to murder those children.
I have little doubt that each of you will in due course be sentenced to several terms of life imprisonment."
It's a matter for the judge where a whole life order is imposed.
They will be sentenced on 12 November.
Nepalese ministers of agriculture and forestry visit Topa, Mie, to observe city's waste recycling technology - Ise Newspaper
[Minister Dawa (far right) and other ministers from Nepal's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry observing recycling facilities at Toba's Recycling Park]
[Toba] Dawa Dorje Lama, the Nepalese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and nine other ministers visited Toba City Hall and Recycling Park in Oakihigashi-machi on the 26th to observe the city's technology for turning raw waste into compost.
Up until now, most domestic waste in Nepal was buried in landfills, but an exchange student introduced the country to the composting technology being researched by Hashimoto Rikio (67), a professor at the Japan institute of Agricultural management in Tsu, and Nepal has now begun initiatives to introduce waste recycling in the model city of Thimi in Kathmandu District, with the aim of promoting organic agriculture free from pesticides.
They have first visited this facility in Feburary 2018, since this facility, established in Toba, Mie Prefecture in 2007 utilizes this technology, and this time marks their third visit to the facility.
Minister Dawa, who was participating for the first time, met with Mayor Nakamura Kinichiro at the city hall, and said, "Japanese technology is advancing at a global level. I want to expand this scheme not just to Thimi, but nationwide," seeking exchange with the view to forming a sister city alliance.
In response, Mayor Nakamura said, "I'm delighted to receive such high praise even though the scheme has not yet spread to the all the citizens of Toba. I would like to continue our reciprocal exchange in the future."
Saga heavy rains: torrential rain disaster, what happened then... mothers with young children share their experiences proposal to the local government "Preparations need to be made that suit family units" | Local Topics | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
On the 27th, "Shiroishi Town Childcare Support Club Hug Hug" (representative: Tanaka Tomoko) held a round-table discussion in the Ariake Community Centre in Sakada, Shiroishi, to share experiences and the lessons learnt from the recent heavy rain in Saga.
Around 20 mothers with young children thought about the form of disaster prevention that would be most suited to their family, and collated their observations and requests for the local government.
Kusumoto Saori (32) of Kitagata-machi, Takeo, said that her 3-year-old who had previously liked nursery school suddenly no longer wanted to go after the floods, and had begun to have nightmares.
Looking back on it, she remarked, "I think it could have been because the adults were so busy with cleaning up their homes, that we couldn't spend the proper amount of time with our children," adding, "I'd like to be prepared for a disaster so that I can tell my children that everything is okay, and don't panic as an adult."
Ogushi Yukari (36) of Shiroishi told of how she spent the night at the town hall which was being used as an evacuation shelter with all four member of her family, including her 3-year-old child.
She said of the experience, "When you have a child who can't stay still, you worry about the people around you."
The area around the house of a woman (45) in central Saga, who has five children aged four to 12, was completely submerged.
Reasoning that, "I can't carry all five to safety," she has prepared food and a portable toilet with the intention of staying home in an emergency if possible.
"There's no correct way to prepare. The kind of preparations that are necessary vary depending on one's family structure and living conditions," she appealed.
Kawasaki Shinako (40) from Shiroishi, who has a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old, said, "There was an email from the primary school the day before to say that it would be closed, but the nursery school has neither a network nor an email system. It would be good if they had a system to send out mass emails."
There was also demand for the creation of a system that would share what roads are flooded in real time.
Ms. Kawasaki said, "The weather is now different from how it used to be, so one cannot simply say 'It was fine last time.' I'd like disaster preparations to take into account things like people connections and other schemes.
Club representative Tanaka expressed their intention to present their opinions as a group to the government.
Boris Johnson referred to police watchdog over friendship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now assess whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was mayor of London.
The Greater London Authority (GLA) said in a statement that the authority's monitoring officer had recorded a "conduct matter" against the Prime Minister over allegations Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him.
"A "conduct matter" exists where there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed," it said.
It does not mean that this is proved in any way.
The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated.
The issue has been referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales.
It was referred to the watchdog because Mr Johnson at the time held the post equivalent to a police and crime commissioner.
Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Ms Arcuri.
Earlier he said that he would comply with an order by the London Assembly to provide details of his links with Ms Arcuri, although he insisted they were "barking up the wrong tree."
It follows a report by The Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given £126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.
The Government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Ms Arcuri's company, Hacker House, pending a review.
It is facing embarrassing questions about the verification process carried out before awarding the money.
Digital Minister Matt Warman told the Commons that his department had done the "usual due diligence" and that the company had a British phone number.
However, numerous reports said calls to the number were directed to an office in California, where Ms Arcuri, 34, is said to now be based.
PM's friendship with businesswoman 'was open secret among staff'
The move by the GLA to refer the Prime Minister to the Independent Office for Police Conduct has met with anger from No 10.
A senior Government source said it was "a politically motivated attack" and that the timing - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - was "overtly political."
"No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night," the source said.
The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.
Earlier today, the Standard was told Mr Johnson's close friendship with the Californian entrepreneur helped by London's tourism and promotions agency was an "open secret" among its staff.
Former officials at the agency, London & Partners (L&P), recalled how Ms Arcuri was given places on foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson in his time as mayor despite her companies being regarded as "not credible" by some at the time.
Trustworthy fund for the average joe to build up wealth!
Sawakami Fund's 20th anniversary now (Morning Star) - Yahoo! News
We asked the Chief Executive Officer of Sawakami Fund, Mr. Sawakami Ryo (Picture) about his vision for the future.
"Sawakami Fund" has celebrated its 20th anniversary since it's founding this August.
Looking back the past 20 years, how do you feel at this moment?
First of all, the 20 years of history was built on many people's emotions and hard work.
I would like to show my deepest gratitude for all those who have taken part, since this history was not achieved only with “Sawakami Fund”.
Sawakami Fund was initially founded with the desire to “support wealth accumulation of average citizens”
This motto has not changed, and we have pursued this goal honestly for 20 years.
Our company as a whole strives to do our best daily, with the belief that if people are free from financial stress, the world will inherently get brighter.
In the long run, great results will not be achieved unless management is in lockstep with beneficiaries.
A great amount of money comes into "Sawakami Fund" during times of market free-fall, such as Lehman Shock and IT bubble burst.
I feel that our message, that we always say, which is "in times like these, we want to support companies that are truly needed", is understood well.
The result is the reason our fund became a long lasting fund with 20 years behind it, and because we have a direct sales approach that allows us to relay our message to our customers, this was possible.
We have been disclosing the list of all the investing companies, amounts, and cost in our monthly report.
Usually, information of what is being bought is a black box and only results are relayed, but "Sawakami Fund" discloses everything.
This transparency must be another reason people trust us.
Third man charged with drug counts in Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offenses in connection with rapper Mac Miller's overdose death last year.
Court documents show Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died last September of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid contributing to an epidemic that's claimed thousands of lives in the U.S.
Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed Tuesday say Pettit kept getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is accused of serving as Walter's "runner" who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of the men have been directly charged with Miller's death or have entered pleas in their cases.
Walter, who is on supervised release in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been ordered to serve five months in prison for violating the terms of his release.
Prosecutors handling the case, which was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ, are asking that Walter remain in custody while he awaits trial, calling him a serious flight risk.
A phone message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.
Pettit was charged in federal court on Sept. 4, and his attorney has declined to comment.
Miller's rhymes included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.
The Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick was also in a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018.
After his death, she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, "Thank U Next," that lovingly mentioned him.
Miller is among the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016 and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.
This story has been corrected to show that Walter's first name is spelled Stephen, not Steven.
9 year old Nigerian builds more than 30 mobile games
The 9-year-old is building a hide and seek game, using a free programming application called Scratch 2.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has used it to generate more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game involves a bat he has programmed to hide.
The player gets a point every time he catches the bat when it emerges from its hiding place.
I learned how to build games at a boot camp.
"Now, I build to keep me busy when I am bored," Basil told CNN.
In March, his father signed him up for a five-day boot camp for children aged 5 to 15.
The camp, organized by Codefest International, was put in place to give children like Basil access to emerging technologies like robotics and virtual reality.
Growing up, Basil used to play a lot of mobile games says his father, Basil Okpara Sr.
"I bought him a tablet when he was 4 years old because I saw that he was always grabbing phones to play games with.
He played Candy Crush and Temple Run a lot," the father told CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating his games grew at age 7 after he got scolded for spending all of his time playing.
"There was this day he was on the tablet, as usual, he was so carried away with the game he was playing that I got upset with him," his father said.
Out of annoyance, I said to him, 'you are always playing games, can't you think about building your own games so others can play yours too?'.
I was angry when I said it, and I did not know he took it seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil actively showed interest in learning how to make his own games, prompting his parents to buy him a laptop and register him to learn the first steps of building games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, titles his games based on what they are about.
One of his games, 'Mosquito mash' is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest youth population in the world, and like Basil, this population is taking the lead when it comes to innovation on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently celebrated for using codes to build robots to sort out their house chores.
In May, team Acrobot, a Ghanaian all-girls high school team won the 2019 Robofest competition by programming robots to stack boxes.
And with Africa experiencing increased investment from tech giants like Google and Microsoft, Basil and his peers are on their way to becoming future coding stars.
Former North Carolina GOP Chair To Plead Guilty For Lying In Bribery Probe
A former North Carolina GOP chairman will admit in court that he lied to federal agents conducting a bribery investigation of a major political donor, according to court documents filed Friday.
The federal court docket shows that Robin Hayes is scheduled to enter a guilty plea next Wednesday.
A factual basis document prepared as part of the plea agreement and signed by Hayes' attorney said that Hayes knew he was making false statements to FBI agents conducting the bribery probe in 2018.
The actual plea agreement is sealed, and the factual basis doesn't specify which charges he'll plead guilty to.
He was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and making false statements.
Prosecutors have accused Hayes, a former congressman, of involvement in an insurance executive's plan to funnel campaign contributions to the state's top insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
The executive, Greg Lindberg, and two of his associates have been charged with attempting to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is an insurance and investment firm founder who has been among the state's top political donors in recent years, giving more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He favored Republican causes and politicians, but also gave to Democrats.
His attorney did not respond to an email seeking comment Friday.
A defense attorney for Hayes, Kearns Davis, didn't respond to an email Friday seeking further comment.
The court documents filed Friday state that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had never had conversations with Causey about staff at the state Department of Insurance.
But Hayes had in fact spoken to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make personnel changes within the regulator's agency, according to the factual basis document.
Prosecutors have said that Hayes also helped Lindberg request a meeting with Causey and that Hayes discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.
An indictment unsealed in April alleges that Lindberg wanted special treatment for his insurance businesses and planned to funnel up to $2 million for Causey's 2020 reelection campaign.
The scheme involved a request to replace a department official who had been examining a Lindberg company, according to the indictment.
Causey, a Republican, reported the alleged attempted bribe to federal investigators and helped them build their case.
He faces no charges.
The indictment states that an associate of Lindberg's directed Hayes to transfer $250,000 to Causey's reelection campaign during a conversation that also included Lindberg and Causey.
Hayes initially protested, saying that moving so much money would draw attention, but eventually relented during the conversation, according to the indictment.
"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Alright, I'll get "er done."
A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office didn't respond to an email seeking further information about the plea agreement.
Facebook to hide number of likes in trial aimed at improving users' wellbeing
Some Facebook users will soon no longer see the number of likes, reactions and video views on other's posts in a world-first trial aimed at boosting users' wellbeing.
Instead, likes will be private and only visible to the post's author in a change that follows a similar test on Instagram which started in July in Australia.
The new Facebook trial, which begins on Friday, will also kick off in Australia.
Facebook Australia's director of policy Mia Garlick said the change was based on wellbeing research and feedback from mental health professionals that the number of likes can cause social comparison.
"We've had really positive feedback from a lot of the anti-bullying groups and mental health organisations that we work with," Garlick said.
It really is just taking that number out of the equation, so that people can focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.
It's hoped that people will be more comfortable with sharing on the platform rather than feeling like it's a competition, she said.
Garlick assured businesses who rely on Facebook they will still receive all the same metrics and insights they previously accessed.
She said it was too early to say if the test would roll out to other countries like Instagram's trial has in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication of when the trial will end or if the change will be made permanent.
"We have had some initial positive feedback from the public about the experience [on Instagram], but we're still just learning and listening to feedback at this stage," she said.
On being the world's training ground Garlick said Australia has very active "tech-savvy" users of Facebook and Instagram.
We think this is a great country where we can get some really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people on our services or not.
Rugby World Cup "Miracle!"
"I was moved to tears" the surprise upset in Osaka caused joy (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Osaka was in cheers at Japan's surprise upset as well.
Yamanaka Takeo (61), a company employee from Naniwa-ku, Osaka who watched the match on a outdoor monitor in Dotonbori, excitedly said "A miracle happened! I can't believe it!"
"I thought it was over since they lost the first half, but the turn around surprised me. It's going to be interesting from now," he shared his delight with his friends.
Sugishima Jo (37), a company employee from Mino City, Osaka who watched at a sports bar near Dotonbori, is an experienced rugby player.
"It was like a cat beating a tiger. When they won, I was moved to tears," he said full of emotion, "I am so happy they are able to compete at the world's level. I'm sure they will win," he said with conviction.
New Zealander Tony Lin (50), visiting Japan with his wife for the world cup match, watched wearing a Japanese jersey at a pub in Osaka.
"It was tough game, but I'm Japan played a really well.
"The victory isn't that much of a surprise since they have improved compared to 8 years ago," he said.
Budget DIY repairs of bags with broken metal fitting [CanDo] "Holder Parts (Ring Type)" (Lettuce Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, the metal fitting on my mother's favorite bag came off and was lost.
If a favorite bag breaks, it's natural to want to repair it and keep using it.
What helped me at that time was a handicraft component from Cando.
Just when I was about to give up thinking "they may not have it anymore..."
My mother's broken bag is actually an ultimate bargain item.
So, if you asked a store to repair it, the cost would exceed the worth of the bag.
My mother sadly said "maybe it's time to give it up..." but I didn't want to give up.
First I checked home centers to look for an alternative connective piece.
However, even though there were metal rings, they were all silver colored.
I couldn't find gold anywhere.
I checked CanDo as a last resort, and that's when I found it!
I was impressed when I found it in the handicrafts corner.
As to be expected of a 100 yen shop, you can find anything.
It seems like it was originally meant to be a component for DIY key chains and charms.
We planned to use one on either hand of the bag handle, so we bought 2.
Although the ring is smaller, when you look at it next to the remaining connector, it's exactly the same...!
This opens the way for repairing the bag.
I installed it immediately.
So excited...!
The ring is designed to push inward at its opening so it's resistant to being pulled outward.
I immediately attached it to the bag.
The gold color of the fittings matches well! but, because the ring is small, it's tight and doesn't move well...
So, I decided to connect 2 rings.
The number of parts has increased, but since they are light there's no problem with the weight.
Rather, the sparkling parts have increased, and I feel like the design has leveled up.
National Railroad Express Train Aso becomes temporary train 10 hour trip between Hiroshima and Kumamoto| Shizuoka Newspaper @S
The special train waiting to depart JR Hiroshima Station on the 28th, its livery designed to evoke Express Train Aso during its National Railroad period
Travellers enjoying a ride on the special express train on the 28th, its design inspired by Express Train Aso during its National Railroad period
On the 28th, a special express train whose design was inspired by Express Train Aso during its National Railroad period operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto.
A crowd of around 240 railway fans descended on Hiroshima Station in the morning to board the classic blue 12-series carriages, before setting off on a 10-hour journey to Kumamoto.
The Aso Express is a former night train that operated from 1950 to 1980, connecting Tokyo and Kumamoto.
This time, it operated just one round trip (taking two days), organised as a tour by the Nippon Travel Agency as part of the Destination Kumamoto Campaign planned by Japan Railways.
The train consists of seven cars, the locomotive and six coaches, and ran on the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
It featured a special name plate depicting Mount Aso.
Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing
Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."
Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.
"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.
In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.
But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.
Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.
The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.
Sending 1600 cold protection sheets to disaster area Prefecture off-shore earthquake, Headquarters to donate 1600 sheets and container｜Yamagata Newspaper
"Box of cold protection sheets" located in Tsuruoka city, Nezugaseki district's primary evacuation site, "former Nezugaseki junior high school grounds"
Yamagata Newspaper is donating 1600 aluminum cold and heat resistant evacuee sheets and 5 containers to store them (totaling 1 million yen worth) to 4 neighborhood associations in Atsumi district, Tsuruoka city that have been affected by the earthquake in June that had the epicenter off the coast of this prefecture.
They will be placed in primary evacuation sites that have been established in preparation for a tsunami, in each coastal districts.
On the 2nd of next month, the presentation ceremony will be conducted at the "former Nezugaseki junior high school grounds", the primary evacuation site in Nezugaseki district.
Because of the earthquake damage that occurred in Tsuruoka City, which has a cooperative agreement, cold protection sheets and other items will be sent to the neighborhood association in the Atsumi district, which is closest to the epicenter.
Donation destinations include neighborhood associations in; Atsumi (400 sheets), Koiwakawa (500 sheets and 2 containers), Hayada (300 sheets and 1 container) and Nezugaseki (400 sheets and 2 containers).
When the earthquake occurred in the prefecture's offshore, many residents along the coast of Japan sea evacuated wary of the tsunami.
In the city of Tsuruoka, evacuation took place to primary evacuation sites located on higher grounds above each settlement.
No large-scale tsunami occurred, and most evacuees returned home without moving to a fully equipped secondary evacuation shelter, but many of the primary evacuation sites were outdoor and people complained about the cold weather.
In preparing for a similar disaster, one of the tasks was making a counterplan in case of cold weather, wind or rain.
The sheet can be used to cover the whole body to protect from cold, wind and rain.
It also has a heat shielding function that can be used under the hot sun.
The sheet is approximately 1.3 meters × 2.1 meters, and it folds into a small size of 9 cm × 12 cm.
It is a 4-layer structure and depending on the situation you may use the gold side on the front or silver side on the back, utilizing the cold protection ability when cold and heat shielding ability under the sun.
For the outdoor primary evacuation sites, there will be metal containers set up to store the sheets.

[Okinoerabu General Affairs Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (Amami, chairman: Sonoda Akira ) and Okinoerabu Sports Club ELOVE (China-cho, chairman: Maeda Junya) entered into a partnership to promote and encourage sports on the outlying islands on the 25th.
As well as proactively linking the projects run by both organisations, such as coaching for various sports, they will also establish a mutual support system to prevent against injuries and manage the physical condition of children from the outlying islands when they go on trips away from the islands.
When the two organisations run sports-related courses, they will work as agents to dispatch their associated trainers and instructors, and share information with each other.
They will also work on solutions for the problems encountered when a team from one of the outlying islands travels to a tournament away from the islands, such as the issue of bringing the trainer along being cost prohibitive due to travel expenses.
For instance, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, ASA will coordinate with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Centre to offer players support to prevent their performance deteriorating from the fatigue caused by travelling by ferry and staying consecutive nights in accommodation.
Similarly, when tournaments occur on Amami-Oshima and Okinoerabu-shima, the organisations will coordinate with local osteopaths and hospitals to provide support to players visiting from the mainland.
A signing ceremony was held at Erabucoco, China-cho, on the 25th, with Sonoda and Maeda shaking hands.
Afterwards, the two organisations co-hosted a class on taping given by the athletic trainer, Hidaka Yuichiro.
Local junior sports club members, club leaders and parents learned how to tape effectively, as well as how to prevent injuries.
Chairman Sonoda (52) commented, "We have a common goal of working to eliminate the handicap of the outlying islands as an environment for sports, and there are many areas where we can cooperate. I hope that entering into this partnership will allow us to expand our sphere of cooperation to the other islands of Amami."
Chairman Maeda (43) said of the partnership, "It was very encouraging for us to be able to form a partnership with an organisation that has such a strong track record like ASA. I'd like to absorb as much as possible to help better the sports environment for children on the outlying islands."
Mogi Kenichiro "This is the era of "collapse of conventional common sense"
Men who are able to renew their natural self are the popular ones" (Leon. JP) - Yahoo! News
As a neuroscientist, Mogi Kenichiro has been thinking about "attraction" much more than others.
Eye-opening "Neuroscience based attraction theory" freely applying his extensive knowledge and latest studies.
We are presenting the second half.
In the first half (see related article), Mogi argued that unattractive men hang onto the typical notion of "men fantasy", and overwhelmingly lack pattern learning to become more attractive.
In the second half, he explains how to shed one's loser skin and become attractive.
"Must" mindset makes it hard to thrive
In the first half, he emphasized the need to learn patterns on a daily basis by observing a variety of arts and people since "attractiveness" is constantly evolving.
Pattern learning allows one's brain to systemize behaviors in different situations, probably leading to a carefree life.
I still see myself evolving daily whether I am attractive or not.
That's why I can skate through life.
Since I used to give lectures at Tokyo Institute of Technology and Tokyo University of the Arts, I have had many opportunities to interact with younger people, and I have also learned many of their different communication patterns.
However, if I had cared about my title as a university professor and had the notion of "a university professor should act more dignified" I might have had a bit of a tough time.
Since I do not care about stuff like that, I enjoy my day-to-day life.
When you start caring about how "one should do this" or "one should be this", sure enough, you will have a harder time enjoying life.
Because people and the society are going to change even if you stay the same.
In my latest interview book "Ikiru-Donnani hidoi sekaidemo", I also talked a great deal about the same topic.
"Dignity" and "authority" naturally arise only when recognized by others.
You have to be light-hearted.
If you ask for it, you will get frustrated.
Take Takeshi for example, he did the Comaneci move at Cannes Film Festival.
Although he was being goofy, he was still treated as a "great filmmaker."
If you have many achievements, there is no need to act arrogant at all.
In other words, "should be" gets in the way of becoming light-hearted.
From my many conversations with women, it seems that "endearment" is the get-out-of-jail-free card and hope for any man, and they do not care about your status or age.
This "being endearing" is actually quite difficult to achieve.
What in the world is an "endearing middle-aged man" (laughs).
Lawlessness double displaced from NW Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
Worsening violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwest Nigeria to some 40,000 over the past four months, the United Nations said on Friday.
The UN's refugee agency said the turmoil had created a "new humanitarian emergency" that would require a fresh inter-agency fundraising effort of $35.5 million by the end of the year.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said Boko Haram, the Islamist group that has waged a decade-long insurgency in the north of the country, was not responsible for the latest attacks.
Rather, the upsurge of violence in the past 10 months in Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina states in Nigeria was the work of organized armed groups.
"It paints a horrible picture of lawlessness and insecurity," he told journalists on Friday.
He said there were frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder and sexual violence by attackers who also destroy homes and steal property.
Military and police have been deployed to tackle criminal gangs in the region.
But the military is stretched from fights against Boko Haram and Islamic State's West Africa branch, which split from the former group in 2016.
"The refugees are not coming with names of groups," he said.
What they are coming with are horrific accounts.
Those fleeing are mostly crossing into neighboring Niger.
In a statement, the UNHCR said it expected more to flee to Niger in the coming months as the security situation, particularly in Sokoto state, deteriorates.
New trial date set for man accused of killing woman, 2 kids
A new trial date has been scheduled for a Guatemala man accused of killing an Iowa woman and her two children.
Polk County District Court records say 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is charged with three counts of first-degree murder under what authorities say was a false name he initially gave to police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He's pleaded not guilty.
Police say he fatally shot 29-year-old Rossibeth Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on July 16 in a Des Moines home.
Court records show the new trial date of Jan. 27 will give attorneys for both sides more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and had twice been deported before the shooting.
He was convicted in 2010 of illegal entry into the U.S.
Distribution of adverts implementing header bidding via Prebid.js in Logicad for Publishers (hereafter, LFP) offered by So-net Media Networks (SMN), has begun.
LFP is a service that allows advertisers to individually plan and purchase advertising space according to their needs.
In cooperation with publishers, this service provides effective advertising space through the DSP Logicad.
Header bidding is a technique that allows multiple bidders (advertising companies) to bid fairly, so that the highest-bidding adverts will be displayed preferentially on the publisher's media platform.
It is increasingly being adopted by major media companies as a solution that offers a high level of transparency and increased revenue.
Up until now, Logicad had offered advertising space via SSP.
However, in recent years, in response to advertisers' wish to be able to "distribute ads to specific advertising spaces that are in line with their brand image or individual products", we launched LFP last December in cooperation with publishers, allowing the direct purchase of advertising space that suits the advertisers' needs.
With adding support for header bidding, the number of places where LFP is used will increase.
One of the many benefits for advertisers is that the support of header bidding in LFP will make it possible to directly participate in bidding for advertising space eligible for header bidding, thereby increasing the opportunities for ad distribution.
What's more, since the target publishers are limited, the advertising space that bests fits with the brand image or individual products can be secured, thereby preventing the risk of damaging the value of the brand.
Benefits for the publisher include the "wrapper solution", a management solution that assigns each bidding company a code, making it possible for publishers to introduce them as they see fit.
Products of small and medium-sized companies sold on overseas ecommerce sites thanks to JETRO support | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
The Japanese External Trade Organization (JETRO) is supporting market expansion for small and medium-sized business through overseas ecommerce websites.
A special Japanese page will be set up on the websites, where a curated selection of products from across the nation will be introduced, and able to be purchased directly by customers overseas.
So far, more than 1,000 companies have applied to join the scheme, and are already beginning to see results in the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.

Yamagata University announced on the 27th, a disciplinary action of 2 months suspension against a 30 year old male assistant professor working at the Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) for power harassment and authoritarian behavior towards students.
This disciplinary action went into effect the same day.
According to the university's general affairs department, this male assistant professor have been causing substantial emotional stress on multiple students at a lab since October 2017, by becoming emotional and repeating intimidating behavior such as shouting abusive inappropriate words while instructing.
It was recognized that this deteriorated the learning environment, as it was power harassment in an educational guidance setting.
This claim was made by multiple students on surveys they conducted In September 2018.
In addition to the department of engineering’s administration interviewing the assistant professor and students, the harassment prevention committee, made up by faculty members at Yonezawa campus, have continued investigations since December of the same year, and at the end one student claimed there was harassment.
In response to the investigation conclusion from the committee, the board, consisting of Dean Koyama Kiyohito and trustees, decided on a disciplinary action.
The male assistant professor continued teaching after the survey was conducted, but his actions have improved with been through consultations, and he is said to been "feeling sorry".
Dean Koyama released a comment saying "I sincerely apologize to the victims and everyone concerned. The entire school will work on preventing harassment and recovering trust."
The university is also investigating internally a male instructor from the engineering department who has been suspected of sexually harassing a female student, and if any disciplinary actions are implemented, they will announce it.
Boris Johnson faces Cabinet revolt to lower Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with Brussels - The Sun
With just three weeks to go until a showdown EU leaders' summit, fears are growing around the PM's top table that he is running out of time to win major concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU.
Negotiators are deadlocked over a new customs system to replace the Irish backstop, with Brussels branding Mr Johnson's alternative arrangements proposals as "unworkable."
Senior ministers expect EU power brokers - led by Germany's Angela Merkel - to offer the embattled Tory leader a last minute compromise, such as a three year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun has spoken to three different Cabinet ministers, who are all preparing to confront him after the Tories" annual conference in Manchester next week.
They will demand he abandons the "aggressive" strategy devised by senior aide Dominic Cummings to try to bluff the EU with the threat of No Deal, and insist he accepts the EU's last minute offer.
One Cabinet minister dubbed the crushing Supreme Court verdict to end Parliament's suspension on Tuesday as "a wake-up call," adding: "A deal is the only way we can leave on October 31 now.
We're never going to beat the numbers in the Commons, and they are against us.
The PM has to lean in now and take what he can get.
Being aggressive doesn't work, the Cummings plan has clearly failed.
We just can't fight battles on so many fronts.
A second Cabinet minister has vowed to tell Mr Johnson to try to push through ex-PM Theresa May's deal if all else fails.
That senior minister added: "I will tell Boris to put Theresa's deal back to the Commons if I have to."
The numbers are there for it now, everyone is desperate to end this.
It's all over for Boris and it's all over for all of us if we're forced to extend.
Sir John Major accused Boris of not taking the negotiation seriously.
In a withering speech, the former Tory premier said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe.
But we don't see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.
Instead, we do see him wrestling with bulls in Scotland; inspecting eggs in Wales; and arguing with the public in high streets - for all the world as if an election campaign was already in full swing."
The PM's spokesman yesterday admitted a deal was still far off, saying: "No one should be under any illusion - there is a very long way to go if we are to secure a deal."
But the spokesman also said the Benn Act to enforce a three months delay if there is no deal was "actively undermining our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that it has hindered our negotiating position but the Prime Minister and colleagues through hard work have continued to try and make progress in the face of that piece of legislation."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay goes back to Brussels today for more talks with the EU's Michel Barnier.
They will discuss a paper on how an all-Ireland zone on food and livestock would work.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told I'd never make it in TV with a Glasgow accent
Lorraine Kelly revealed that TV bosses told her she would "never make it" as a presenter because of her Glaswegian accent.
Looking back on 35 years in broadcasting, Kelly, 59, recalled how she felt "very nervous" ahead of her first appearance on screen.
"I was only 25 and very nervous," she said.
I had been working as a researcher at BBC Scotland and been told by the big boss that I would never make it in TV because of my Glasgow accent.
I went down to London to meet all of the TV-am team and see the show being broadcast, before taking over at the Glasgow office.
I will never forget, Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the icon that is Bette Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to be.
Kelly started her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbride, Scotland before becoming a Scottish correspondent for TV-am in 1984.
She went on to host shows including GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak before launching her eponymous morning programme Lorraine.
She will mark her 35th anniversary with a special show looking back at her most memorable moments and interviews.
The presenter said that "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the secret to longevity in TV, adding: "You have to put in the work.
You have to be honest and authentic.
Do your homework and be both interested and interesting.
Looking back at the news stories that impacted her emotionally, Kelly revealed that reporting on the Dunblane massacre was "very tough."
I had no idea that many of the families whose children had been killed or wounded were watching our live show from Dunblane the day after the horrific killing of sixteen children and their teacher.
One of the mums, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked to see me privately and we ended up talking for hours at her house.
It was all under the radar, I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I have been friends ever since.
She added that interviewing Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine went missing in 2007 was "extremely hard" and said that she "really admired their strength and courage."
They have had to put up with the pain of not knowing what has happened to their beloved daughter, as well as the most appalling trolling online.
My heart goes out to them.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary show is on Monday, September 30 from 8.30am on ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga Feared Trapping
Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga turned down an offer by the late president Robert Mugabe to take over the presidency at the height of the coup as he feared it might be a trap to rubberstamp the military take-over in November 2017, a senior government official has claimed.
As reported by the Zimbabwe Independent last week, Mugabe offered Chiwenga to take over the presidency as negotiations between him and the army ensued during the coup.
However, a senior government official said on social media Chiwenga did not turn down the offer out of fear, but he was able to see through Mugabe's plan to use him to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that indeed he had been toppled in a coup.
In a Twitter thread which confirmed Zimbabwe's 37-year-ruler was willing to hand over power to Chiwenga and not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom government officials confirmed was a senior government official in the Office of the President and Cabinet, said intense negotiations were held at the time over the issue.
Government officials said Mugabe approached Chiwenga through one of his emissaries when he realised power was slipping though his hands.
Intercession between the military command element and late former president had three strands, according to the senior government official.
The official said characters involved in the negotiations included presidential spokesperson George Charamba, Central Intelligence Organisation then acting boss Aaron Nhepera and Roman Catholic Bishop cleric Fidelis Mukonori.
Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono was another strand after he was sent by Mugabe on a one-man mission with the offer of the presidency to Chiwenga who was the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander.
The man, who in death more than in life has been described as an African icon, tried in vain to get the AU to denounce the military operation, while seeking intervention by other African leaders.
Offer of presidency to then CDF (Commander Defence Forces Chiwenga) by the late (Mugabe) was not by choice.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation which had grown dangerously fast-paced; wearing down a part of the late's family," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was also a bit of political baiting which the late hoped would turn the tables, at the very least diplomatically.
Recall that commanders had declared they had not, and would not, overthrow the constitutional order, a development which would have set them on a collision with the AU position on coups.
The late (Mugabe) hoped the then CDF (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, thereby putting paid to claims by commanders they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for (the) late (Mugabe) was that the AU, which by the way was still very confused by the whole situation and how to fit it within its theoretical taxonomy on coups, would then have no option, but to describe it as a coup, in which case calls for military intervention would then have credence.
That was the spirit and calculation within which the offer was made.
Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realised that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter after the military had warned the strongman that he risked a Gadaffi-style lynching.
Military bosses told him they would not turn their guns on citizens if they marched to his Blue Roof residence.
And at that instant Mugabe had two desires, to save his family and also to prove that the military had taken over power," the official said.
The then CDF and commanders correctly read (the) calculation.
The emissary (Gono) of that desperate message was told -- through a powerful metaphor -- that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the sect of camouflages, that is, the military); we are not politicians or (in) political competition, the senior government official said.
Government officials say the army had communicated to other military bosses in the region through attachés who were in Zimbabwe that their intentions were not to topple Mugabe, but to deal with "criminals" around him.
Mugabe also tried to use the same strategy to lure Mnangagwa back from short exile in South Africa so that they could have a discussion on the coup and succession.
Apart from negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help from the region.
The South Africans, who were key to the process -- not least because of their economic and regional power, but also because the then president Jacob Zuma was the Sadc chairperson -- refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the army had invaded Mugabe's house, as they were threatening repeatedly in the background, South African troops would have arrived in Harare in no time.
"That did not work because Putin and African leaders did not prefer that route," a source told the Independent.
Second generation of atomic bomb survivor family appeals for nuclear ban at UN, ratification of treaty increases to 32 countries | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
New York: An assembly aimed at creating a world free of nuclear weapons was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on the 26th, at which Takeuchi Michi (63), granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (present day Hiroshima Red Cross & Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, gave a speech and appealed for more support in banning nuclear weapons.
On the day, five new countries ratified the nuclear treaty, bringing the total to 32 nations and regions.
The ratification of 50 nations and regions is required for the treaty to come into effect.
The assembly and ratifications were held to coincide with the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons that was established by the UN.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also spoke, expressing a strong concern that in recent years there has been a trend in opposition of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
He reasserted that, "There is no choice other than the total elimination."
China needs strong leadership or will 'crumble,' policy paper says
China needs the strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party or the country will "crumble," the government said in a policy paper released on Friday ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
China's cabinet news office said in a white paper that the country's success since the Communists took power 70 years ago was down to the party's leadership.
China is huge in size, has complex national conditions, and its governance difficulties are rarely seen.
Without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move toward division and crumble, bringing disaster to the world," it said.
Chinese authorities have long justified a firm fist in dealing with problems, like the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, as being necessary for national stability.
Strong-arm President Xi Jinping, who will headline the anniversary celebrations of the world's second-biggest economy on Tuesday, has further tightened party rule and cracked down on those who may challenge authority since taking office in late 2012.
Xi has also overseen a military modernization program that has unnerved the region.
China does not seek to export its development model nor want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony," the policy paper said.
The Chinese people do not have it in their genes to invade others or dominate the world.
In modern times, China has been bullied by the Great Powers, war and turmoil have left a deep impression with the suffering caused; China will never impose the sufferings it has been through on other peoples.
China is marking the anniversary at a time of uncertainty for the country, which is locked in a bitter trade war with the United States and faces challenges from a slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.
China will never "trade away" its core interests and not allow its security and sovereignty to be compromised, the paper said.
"The threat of trade wars and the continued increase in tariffs are not conducive to solving problems," it said, in reference to its trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, broad market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never be weakened by trade wars," the paper added.
China is confident that it has the ability to face difficulties, turn crises into opportunities, and open up a new world.
The United States should look rationally at China's development, as China has no intention of challenging the United States and does not want to replace the United States, it added.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely to stop China's development.
Curbing and suppressing other countries and transferring domestic contradictions abroad will not keep the United States strong.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama High School dismisses Manager Hirata and Director Kaneko after abusive language discovered (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama High School, a prestigious baseball school boasting five national titles in Spring and Summer tournaments, announced on the 28th that Manager Hirata Toru (36) and Director Kaneko Masa (42) were dismissed effective immediately.
Going forward, Coach Takayama Daiki will be acting Manager and the director (teacher in charge) will be decided on as soon as possible.
As for Hirata and Kaneko, a local newspaper reported on the 26th that there were abusive language towards the baseball team members.
When the school inquired the two, Manager Hirata admitted to grabbing around a student's neck and Director Kaneko admitted to part of the abusive language.
They further confirmed the two’s action based on results from a hearing from 66 students, and as both mostly admitted to them, the 2 were dismissed on the 28th.
In the summer of 2015, former Manager Watanabe Motochima (74), who trained pitcher Matsuzaka Daisuke (currently of Chunichi), retired from Yokohama High School.
Manager Hirata and Director Kaneko took over then.
From the summer of 2016 the team entered Koshien for three years in a row and participated in Senbatsu this spring.
However, they lost the quarterfinals this summer to prefectural school Sagamihara, and to Toko Gakuen in the fall, which meant participation in next spring's Senbatsu was hopeless.
Spice Girls' Mel C bans diet talk at home after eating disorder battle
Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm has admitted diets are banned in her home after her own personal battles with eating disorders which saw her eat nothing but fruit and vegetables for years.
Sporty Spice spent years under-eating and "obsessively exercising" while dealing with the pressures of being in the globally famous pop group and she was later diagnosed with depression as well as an eating disorder.
Now she has revealed that her own experiences affect the way she raises her own daughter, Scarlet and that she doesn't "ever allow people to speak about diets in our house."
"Scarlet's 10 years old now and I'm starting to notice that she's more conscious of the way she looks," said Mel.
But I think one of the positives of having gone through having an eating disorder is that I'm very conscious of how I speak around her.
That positive language - it's habit now.
Speaking to Women's Health magazine, Mel, who shot to fame as part of the Spice Girls in the 1990s, before the rise of social media said that "disgusting" comments about her in the press led to her body issues.
"I started not looking after myself properly, cutting out food groups, and my exercising became more and more obsessive, to the point that I was underweight," she said.
I was unwell and that probably continued for a couple of years."
Court decision on same-sex marriage an opportunity to expand diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun Newspaper Doshin Online Edition
The Moka Branch of Utsunomiya District Court has ruled favourably in a lawsuit over whether a "de facto marriage (common-law marriage)" equivalent to marriage can come into existence between couples of the same sex.
Over 20 countries around the globe now permit same-sex marriage, and even at home, though it has no legal effect, the number of local governments that recognize same-sex partnerships, like Sapporo, are on the rise.
Based on this, the court ruled that the two women in the case were in fact married.
This is significant because it is the first time a court in Japan has ruled to grant legal protection to a same-sex couple.
Lawsuits seeking damages from the state on the grounds that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex marriage based on the provisions of the Civil Code and Family Registration Law have been filed in five district courts, including Sapporo.
It is hoped that this ruling will deepen understanding of rights protection for sexual minorities, and encourage discussion on how a more inclusive legal system that recognizes more diverse families should be.
The women at the centre of the lawsuit had lived together for around seven years and had obtained a marriage certificate in US, but later split when one partner's infidelity was discovered, and now the plaintiff was seeking damages from her former partner.
Based on their time spent living together, the court found that "their actual circumstances were no different from that of a man and woman living together in a common-law marriage".
The result of this groundbreaking decision extends the rights of common-law marriage, which for social insurance and other purposes confers the same rights as traditional marriage, to same-sex couples.
An even more important implication is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution, which stipulates the freedom to marry, stating, "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes".
It was the view of the court that the inclusion of the wording "both sexes" was because, "Same-sex marriage was not envisioned at the time the Constitution was drawn up, but one cannot go so far as to interpret this as meaning that same-sex marriage is denied."
The government has not explicitly said whether or not same-sex marriage is prohibited, but pointing out that the Constitution did not even conceive of same-sex marriages could be used to pin them down, and may bode well for other court cases concerning same-sex marriages around the country.
On the other hand, issues still remain though, as the amount of reparation was reduced due to the fact that same-sex marriage is not approved and therefore the extent of legal protection differs to that available between a man and a woman.
One could argue that it makes no sense to differentiate the rights to be protected while at the same time recognizing that the circumstances were the same as that of a man and woman who are together.
A national survey investigating family trends that was asked to married women revealed a shift in the national consciousness, as over 70% responded that they thought same-sex marriages should be permitted by law.
As lifestyles diversify, if the law is tied to the traditional image of the family, it will encroach on the rights of people who cannot be pigeonholed in such a way.
Since people in common-law marriages are not regarded as "spouses" by the law, there are still various restrictions, such as lack of tax benefits and inability to have joint custody.
In considering same-sex marriage, it will surely become necessary to review the laws governing the rights within families from various perspectives, not just allowing same-sex couples to marry, but also expanding the legal rights conferred to common-law marriages.
Trial of ex-athlete accused of multiple rapes goes to jury
Jury deliberations are under way in the rape trial of an ex-university of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults.
Jurors began deliberating the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway on Friday after 10 days of testimony and arguments.
A 21-year-old woman says Conaway raped her after she drove to his house in June 2018.
The encounter happened three weeks after the two connected on the online meeting site Bumble, and he sent her a nude picture of himself.
She is among six women whom Conaway is accused of sexually assaulting between 2013 and 2018.
Prosecutors say the woman objected when consensual cuddling escalated to Conway forcing himself on her.
Defense attorneys have targeted the woman's conflicting accounts and memory lapses and say she may have regretted being physically intimate.
(Hiroshima) Ogata coach makes noteworthy comment, "We will recapture the pennant next season." (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
Hiroshima, in third place, lost their chance to advance to the CS on its own after losing this season's last game.
If Hanshin, in fourth place, wins all 3 remaining games, their ranks will be switched.
After the post game ceremony, Ogata coach (50) apologized by saying "I am so sorry for losing the last game and not being able to keep the place. I take full responsibility as the coach."
He was booed by some fans.
At the end of his speech he also said, "I will do my best to win back the pennant" insinuating his continuation.
However, when asked about that by the media after the ceremony, he indicated his resignation will be announced after the end of the schedule including the postseason by saying "We have yet to finish everything."
[Hokkaido Sport] Ota 4th batter first time after transfer, hits 20th home run, a personal best Iinherited teachings of now retired Sanematsu and Giants' Abe: Hokkaido Shimbun Newspaper Doshin Online Edition
The home run was like a repayment to the older players who taught him.
Entering the 4th inning with a one-point lead, Ota hit a liner into the left wing seats, securing his 20th home run of the season.
Reacting on having achieved the number of home runs he was aiming for, Ota spoke with pride, "I will learn from this accomplishment and continue to progress through trial and error. This home run meant a lot to me."
Ota was also able to carry out Manager Kuriyama's plan ably.
It was the first time he was assigned to the cleanup spot since transferring.
Kuriyama had told Ota that he'd entered him as the 4th batter so he could "swing away with all his might".
Ota certainly lived up to expectations, saying, "That encouraged me, and I entered the game with great enthusiasm. I spent the whole day genuinely excited."
One of his ideal players to play in the position of 4th batter is the Giants' Shinnosuke Abe, who will retire this season.
He explains, "(The 4th batter) is the core of the team, that can lead it to victory. It's the team's 4th batter that produces results every day. All the older players who were 4th batters that I observed when I was with the Giants were like that."

Video reveals tourist hotspot as heavily polluted
Surrounded by the Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park and of course the iconic Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour is the major contributor to the $21.9 billion Sydney tourism pumps into Australia's economy each year.
But beneath the bridge lies an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous harbour is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, receiving around 15 Olympic-size swimming pools of pollutants each year.
This horrific statistic makes one of our greatest tourism drawcards also one of our dirtiest.
According to a new video, titled Sydney Harbour Above and Below, the waters around Australia's most popular city is filled with cigarette butts, plastic bags and bottles, lost shoes and clothing and even dead animals - all coming into the harbour from stormwater run-off.
But the biggest component choking our waterways is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," Dr Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program said in the video, which was released to coincide with World Tourism Day on September 27.
It does look beautiful, but it is one of the more modified and polluted estuaries along our coastline.
The CSIRO estimates around 1560kg of plastic enters our waterways each hour, most of it coming into the harbour through stormwater drains.
"After we have some of these really big rainfall events, the harbour ... it's quite tragic," Dr Dafforn said.
Two thirds of our pollution comes from stormwater run-off.
But like an iceberg, the problem on Sydney's harbour is far bigger below the surface, with the seabed receiving 70 per cent of plastics that enter the ocean.
"Unless you spend time under the water, I don't think you get a true appreciation of what is below there," Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly said, noting he and his team pull out around 500kg of plastic on their own each year.
I think if more people knew (what was under the water) they would just be horrified.
Overwhelmingly ... over half of everything we find is plastic bags.
The other 50 per cent is at least made out of plastic.
When you look at the harbour it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that we get all of this plastic and all of this rubbish just under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of the Ocean Protect, said there were ways people - both locals and visitors alike - could help to ease the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.
"It has to start at the source," he said.
We have to reduce the amount of plastic that we are using, recycle better and be more conscious about what is going down our drains which ultimately ends up in our oceans.
If we ruin the ocean, we are going to kill ourselves because 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30 per cent of carbon dioxide and our food source.
But we can fix this harbour and bring it back to where it was, but it's pretty simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The video, which was funded by recycling company TOMRA as part of their broader efforts to educate Australians on protecting the environment and reducing the impact of drink containers that can often end up in nature, coincides with a study about plastic and mental health that was also released this month.
A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found 82 per cent felt hopeless about plastic waste and 25 per cent blamed adults for the single-use plastic waste problem.
The study revealed plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern for parents, with 93 per cent of 551 parents surveyed saying they are increasingly worried about the level of plastic waste entering the oceans.
Many who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste but just didn't know how to make a difference, which was leading to eco-anxiety.
Chimneys of the former Karatsu power station to be dismantled in October | Politics and Society | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
The chimneys of the former Karatsu power station, Futago, Karatsu, due to be dismantled starting in October
Kyushu Electric Power announced on the 26th that it will begin dismantling the chimneys of the former Karatsu power plant (petrothermal) in Futago, Karatsu, in October.
The dismantling work is expected to be finished before the end of March 2021.
The two chimneys to be dismantled both stand around 180m high, and were used to discharge gas when the plant was in operation.
Originally, there were three, but one was demolished in 1991 due to dilapidation.
The chimneys will be taken down one at a time, using a tower crane to take them apart from the top down.
According to the plans for the project, the dismantling will take nine months per chimney, a total of 18 months.
The schedule for demolishing the remaining turbine hall and boiler has yet to be decided.
Some people have expressed regret at the dismantling, with a man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby saying, "When I return from a long trip and see the chimneys, they're like a symbol that makes me feel like I'm back in Karatsu. I'll be sad to see them go."
The Karatsu power plant started operation in 1967, with the unit 1 combustion chamber being abolished in 1989, and the unit 2 and 3 chambers following in 2015.
It occupies a site approximately 225,000m族 in area in one part of Karatsu Higashi Port.
Both the prefectural yacht harbour and JR Nishi-Karatsu Station are located nearby, so the prefecture and city hope to be able to make use of the site.
The city, prefecture and Kyushu Electric Power signed an agreement in 2015 over how the site is to be used.
Pupils at Owase High School, Mie, develop and sell products such as fish nuggets using local fish - Ise Newspaper
[Pupils promoting their fish nuggets and rice cooked with bream, at Owase High School, Kodono-cho, Owase]
[Owase] Four third-year pupils studying IT business at Owase Prefectural High School in Kodono-cho, Owase, Mie Prefecture, have developed fish nuggets and rice cooked with bream using locally caught fish.
They went on to sell them at the school's culture festival on the 26th.
Their efforts form part of Mie University's East Kishu Satellite High School and University Collaboration Project, which is working to revitalize local industries in the East Kishu region, such as fishing and forestry.
The products they developed are fish nuggets that use minced gnomefish caught in the Kumano Sea and rice cooked with cultured bream from Owase.
The pupils said they had young target audiences in mind.
They prepared three kinds of fish nuggets, including one kind with added tofu, and one kind made with tofu and greasyback prawns from Owase.
They had the cooperation of the Kumano Fisheries Cooperative, which prepared the minced fish in one of their processing plants in Yuki-cho, Kumano.
The rice cooked with bream was mixed with shitake mushrooms and carrot.
The cooking was overseen by Owase Fish Market Ototo (Kodono-cho, Owase), which is directly managed by Owase Produce, a fishery in Hayashi-machi, Owase.
The class began back in June.
During this time, there were visits to factories that process produce from Owase, and understanding of the fishing industry was deepened.
In workshops, they discussed consumer needs and tried sample food products.
Originally, nuggets with horse mackerel were considered, but eventually gnomefish was used because horse mackerel had a particular fish smell.
Yamaguchi Masaki (17) says, "We made a product that even people who don't like fish can enjoy. I'd be really glad if many people come and eat it."
They are currently in discussions with local tourist facilities to have them sell their products.
I am where I am because of all the pep talks and encouragement (CBC TV) Yahoo!News
In this interview, a freelance presenter and a commentator on Mondays on "Chanto!" on CBC TV, Takahashi Maasa discussed her mentor.
Mentor's advice that was a lifesaver in the worst of times
To me, the actor Takahashi Hideki was like a mentor to me, beyond being my father.
Even though we were in the same industry, my father is an actor, and I am a presenter.
Although our jobs are different, it was my father who showed me the work ethic and the rules in the industry and what is important as a member of society and a person.
When I was devastated after being called "nepotism hire" and "ugly", even though I gave my 120% to get hired as a presenter for a TV station, my father told me to "work hard enough so people will say that 'although nepotism was assumed, that wasn't the case and Maasa got the job because of her ability'".
2-3 years into my job, when I had a hard time keeping my motivation up and was very discouraged because all the jobs I was assigned to were "for any unassigned female announcer", and I could not get the jobs I wanted to do, my father told me to "especially work hard on jobs that anyone could do, that way it will change to "even though it could have been anyone, It was great having Maasa do it, let's ask for her next time'", and I was able to change my mindset and I worked even harder, slowly leading to a positive change.
Naturally learning "pause" in news reading through father's acting
A lot of people might have not seen me read the news, but I have actually always been around news as a narrator for BS and news programming ever since I started at the TV station.
I believe a newscaster's personality and taste also show when reading news articles, and Matsuko Deluxe has praised me saying "Maasa's news reading is very skillful," which made me really happy and boosted my confidence.
When reading news, I think "pause" is what dictates importance and flair.
I learned from a young age watching my father on stage, in movies, in TV shows and in historical dramas, how to take a breath at punctuations and between sentences as well as when to pause.
To elaborate, I attribute my ability to present myself and respond accordingly at variety shows to many enriching experiences as a child thanks to my father.
A look at the 300-year history of Kumi-odori Dance / education program to spread knowledge | Miyako Mainichi Newspaper Online - Packed with the latest news from Miyakojima!
A workshop at Kyohara Junior High School
Kyohara Junior High School, 26th : A workshop introducing pupils to the roles and effects of the five musical instruments played in a Kumi-odori Dance performance
A Kumi-odori Dance workshop (organized by the Prefectural Board of Education), part of the 2019 Kumi-odori Dance Education Program, was held at Kyohara Junior High School on the 26th.
Pupils from all grades attended, and learned about the dance's origins and 300-year history, as well as the sound effects of the various musical instruments and how they are employed in performance.
Members of the Alumni Club who majored in Ryukyuan Performing Arts at Okinawa Prefectural University of Arts came to the workshop and demonstrated through performance the roles that the sanshin, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute play in the dance.
Leading the workshop was Kawamitsu Kota, a member of the Alumni Club who hails from Miyakojima, who explained the charms of the Kumi-odori Dance.
Three elements make up the dance (music, singing and Ryukyuan dance), and this workshop focused on the element of music, giving the pupils a chance to learn what kind of things the five types of instruments express during the dance.
For instance, it was explained how the sanshin is a component that expresses the thoughts and emotions of the characters along with the song, whereas the kokyu follows and complements the melody of the song and the sanshin.
In the second half, pupils were given the opportunity to actually touch the instruments, experience their tone, and appreciate their beauty as musical instruments.
This program is run with the aim of familiarising pupils with classical Ryukyuan music through musical instruments and getting them interested in Kumi-odori Dance; this is the first time the workshop was held in Miyako.

The event has not been held in Japan since it was last held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What will WRC be like when it returns in 2020?
WRC World Rally Championship is one of the 4 world championships organized by Federation Internationale de Automobile (FIA) along with Formula 1 (F1) and World Endurance Championship (WEC.)
Since 1973, it has been held every year and has become the world's foremost rally championship for its history and tradition, and considered the toughest car race due to the fact it has been held not only on public roads (paved) but also on roads in various conditions such as gravel and snow.
In 2018 season, Toyota gained attention by winning the WRC manufacturer's title in their second season after their return.
This time, Japan Round Invitation Preparation Committee was formed in hopes of hosting the sought after race.
As a result, 2020 WRC Japan round was confirmed at World Motorsports Council, the highest legislative body of the federation internationale de automobile (FIA.)
Governors of Aichi prefecture and Gifu prefecture as well as Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT president, Toyota Akio's (President of Toyota Motor Corporation) commented as follows.
The governor of Aichi prefecture Mr. Omura Hideaki
"I wholeheartedly welcome 2020 FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) being hosted in Japan. As the representative of the center of Japanese motorsports and to represent ourselves as best as we can, along with the people who are involved, I will do my best for the success of race in fall of 2020.
The governor of Gifu prefecture Mr. Furuta Hajime
"I feel very honored to host FIA World Rally Championship Japan round, here in "land of clear streams Gifu, " in 2020, the same year Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will be held. This will be the first international motorsports championship for our prefecture, and I am really excited about it. I look forward to having many visitors.
Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT President Mr. Toyota Akio (President of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am excited to have Yaris WRC run in Japan.
Fans, please cheer for us."
Many people in the industry, such as Mr. Furuya Keiji, president of Motorsports promotion organization, have commented on the hosting of Japan round as well.
WRC World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held from November 19 to 22nd, 2020.
The area will be the public roads in Aichi prefecture (Nagoya city, Okazaki city, Toyota city, Shinshiro city, Nagakute city, Shitara Town) and in Gifu prefecture (Nakatsugawa city and Ena city.)
It was announced that "Ai, Chikyu haku Memorial Park (Nagakute city: AKA Morikoro park)" which was built at the site of Japan World Expo in 2005, will be used as the main venue.
In addition, Japan Round Invitation Preparation Committee plans to hold a host confirmation press conference at the site of "Tokyo Motor Show 2019" as well as holding a test event in "Central Rally Aichi/Gifu" on November 9th and 10th, 2019.
Tasmanian devils may hold clues to curing cancer
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to curing cancer - as researchers find a breakthrough which could revolutionise treatment for sufferers
Medical researchers found how some cancer cells can camouflage themselves
Researchers found the same process happens in Tasmanian Devils and humans
The discovery is hoped to provide new methods to treat cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can turn invisible.
Researchers, including from Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, have found a breakthrough which could help revolutionise treatment for some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also hold the key to tackling deadly facial tumours threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study tracked the way some cancer cells in both humans and the marsupial camouflage themselves using a group of proteins known as PRC2, switching off a marker which would otherwise alert the immune system to attack the cancer.
This can be a major challenge in treating small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and a type of skin cancer known as Merkel cell.
'The huge significance from this project is that (in) patients who sometimes become resistant to immunotherapies, we might be able to reverse that process,' lead Peter Mac researcher Mark Dawson told AAP.
Existing treatments could be repurposed to switch back on the markers, proteins known as MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise the cancer cells.
'Potentially, this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,' Prof Dawson said.
'It's one of the most prevalent diseases across the globe.
And we may be able to treat this in a far better way.
Researchers also hope the discovery could eventually be used against Tasmanian devil facial tumours, where cancer cells avoid detection in the same way.
'Remarkably, exactly the same process happens (in human and Tasmanian devil cancers),' Prof Dawson said.
'Thus far it's been very difficult to treat the Tasmanian devil tumours.
But if the drugs that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this may help with the control of the disease.'
Scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star
Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-years away from Earth that defies current understanding about planet formation, with a large Jupiter-like planet orbiting a diminutive star known as a red dwarf.
An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.
Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them.
But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.
"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.
The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes.
In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures.
GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately.
This is why they have a reddish color," Morales said.
There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.
Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit.
Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.
A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said.
This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear.
These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet.
Deli Worker Accused Of Giving Meth-Laced Bean Dip To Co-Worker
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, is accused of giving meth-laced bean dip to a co-worker.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, of Albany, was charged with delivery of methamphetamine and causing another person to ingest a controlled substance, both Class B felonies.
The charges stemmed from an incident that happened Sept. 9 at a Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
A 27-year-old co-worker of the suspect told Marion County Sheriff's Deputies that she went to the deli to get lunch when she saw Medina-Hernandez making bean dip and asked to try some, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by OregonLive.com.
The victim, who told investigators she had never taken meth before, "thought one of the bites she ate tasted odd, but she did not think anything of it," according to the affidavit.
When the woman returned to work, she had an upset stomach and her feet were unsteady.
She went to a local hospital where it was determined the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine, according to the Albany Democrat-Herald.
Police said that another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez "told her about placing drugs inside" the victim's food, while a third worker said the suspect had messaged her claiming the meth was placed in the bean dip by accident, according to The Smoking Gun.
OregonLive reports surveillance video obtained from the deli allegedly shows Medina-Hernandez remove something from inside her bra while her back is to the camera and go behind a microwave and lean down.
She then allegedly wiped her nose after she stood up, walked to a table and placed bean dip in a small paper dish.
The item retrieved from her bra also appeared to be on the plate, police said.
Sheriff's officials said there is currently no reason to believe any customers were served contaminated food, according to the Oregon Statesman-Journal.
Medina-Hernandez is being held in the Marion County jail in lieu of $520,000 bail.
Her lengthy rap sheet shows she was previously convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and felon in possession of a restricted weapon, according to The Smoking Gun.
[Breaking News] Matsuyama Hideki is "72" hole out and is out of the qualifier (Golf Digest Online (GDO)) -Yahoo! News
[Illustration] 1 on challenge hole that is the center of attention.
In the first match of the new season (2019-20), Matsuyama Hideki started out 73rd in the afternoon group and finished with 2 birdies, 2 bogies for "72" total for an even par.
The provisional cut line (up to 65th place) at finish was total of two 2 under, and the round finished outside the range of qualifiers.
Matsuyama started out with a birdie on the fifth hole (par 5) at the first half but hit a 3 put bogey on the 8th hole.
Though he had many opportunities throughout the round, he was noticeably sluggish with puts not making it.
Kodaira Satoshi who started in 28th place with the morning group crumbled with [77] and holed out with a total of 3 over.
It's become very likely he will fail to qualify.
By the time Matsuyama finished, the sole leader was Bryson DeChambeau at "64" with a total 12 under.
The higher ranks have expanded significantly.
President of the Central Japan Railway Company says that issues to do with the Linear Shinkansen and Oi River "can be sorted out", hints at early construction | Shizuoka @S
At a press conference on the 27th, Kaneko Shin, president of the Central Japan Railway Company, speaking about the issue of decreased flow in the Oi River due to construction of a tunnel for the Linear Chuo Shinkansen through the Southern Alps said, "It's important to sort out what needs to be done before construction starts, and what can be done once construction starts," reaffirming his position to start construction work early.
Specifically, he only said that they would "talk at the meeting and at the stage before it".
President Kaneko said, "If you sort out every single problem in advance, it makes it hard to get round to starting construction." Therefore, I believe we can make that kind of distinction."
Although he did state, "This is our way of thinking. We still need to speak (to the prefecture)."
There are strong concerns from prefecture officials that spring water that wells up during the tunnel construction will not be able to be fully returned to the Oi River.
Asked whether they would change the construction method to deal with this, Kaneko replied that they would do something if there was a realistic option, but believed it would be difficult in terms of safety at the construction site.
He contested the route change suggested by Governor Heita Kawakatsu, saying that it was "impossible".
Regarding the impact it might have on the opening of the line, President Kaneko named the Southern Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station and Nagoya Station as three places where construction would take a particularly long time, stating, "Though it can hardly be said that we have leeway (elsewhere), I'm most concerned about the Shizuoka stretch of the construction."

Vice-President of the Postal Service, former Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, expresses gratitude at reprimand issued to NHK president: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Online Edition
On the 28th, it became clear that Suzuki Yasuo, senior vice-president of Japan Post Holdings (former vice-minister at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications), sent a letter to the board of governors of the NHK, praising their action in reprimanding NHK President Ueda Ryoichi last October after receiving complaints from Japan Post Holdings in response to an NHK programme that reported on the illegal selling of Japan Post Life Insurance.
According to a source close to Suzuki, the vice-president sent a letter in November, praising the board of governors' action in reprimanding the president.
In the letter, he also called for a need to strengthen the corporate governance of NHK's executive board, asking the board of governors for "supervision and guidance".
The details were reported to the board of governors.

Mabi kids try international rugby Coaches in Japan for the World Cup visit six elementary schools: Sanyo Newspaper Digital | San-digi
To offer support for the recovery of areas affected by the heavy rains in West Japan, seven coaches from nations including Scotland and Wales, currently in Japan for the Rugby World Cup, descended on six elementary schools in the Mabi district of Kurashiki on the 27th, interacting with the children and teaching them the fun of rugby.
The event was planned by a volunteer organisation in Tokyo that is engaged in meet-and-greet opportunities with players around the country, in an effort to drum-up excitement before the tournament.
At Kawabe Elementary School, which currently has a temporary school building on the grounds of Sono Elementary School, Richard Underwood (42), who coaches a club team in Scotland, and three others met with 54 3rd-graders in the gymnasium.
After learning that in rugby you're not allowed to pass the ball forwards, the children had a go passing the oval-shaped rugby ball in groups of three.
They also had the chance to participate in a game of "tag rugby", a version of the game that doesn't have tackling, and they ran around shouting things like "pass to me!"
One girl (8) said with a smile, "It was difficult passing the ball while running, but it was fun. I like rugby now."
Underwood himself commented, "We came with the intention of encouraging the kids, but they've actually given us a boost. I hope they come away from this with some fun memories."
At Sono Elementary School on the 28th from 2pm, there will be an event for residents featuring players from the Fiji rugby team.
The Fukui Citizens' Baseball Team, who manage Route Inn BC leaguers the Fukui Miracle Elephants, announced September 27th that four players would be retiring: captain and catcher Nakamura Tatsuya (23), pitcher Tsukuda Takayuki (26), pitcher Mochizuki Rei(24) and outfielder Ishii Kento(25).
In all cases, it is voluntary retirement at the behest of a request from the players themselves.
Nakamura attended Yomei Junior High School in Ono.
After going to Fukui Commercial High School and Ryukoku University, he joined the team last year after being drafted from the local pool.
He took on captain duties for the current season, and with 21 safe hits after 89 times at the bat, has a batting average of 23.6%.
He hit two home runs.
Tsukuda was born in Ibaraki Prefecture and transferred to the Miracle Elephants from the ORIX Buffaloes last year.
He pitched in 23 games this season, using the slider as his secret weapon, and won 0, lost 2.
Mochizuki was born in Hiroshima Prefecture and pitched in 17 games this season, and won 0, lost 3.
Ishii is from Kanagawa Prefecture.
Possessing strong shoulders and long batting power, he hit four home runs this season.

Five public hospitals in Saga Prefecture "in need of reorganisation" | Politics and Society | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
On the 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the names of hospitals which are in need of reorganisation or consolidation, including five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture.
Thirteen medical institutions in the prefecture were surveyed, accounting for 38.5%, the tenth highest amount in the country, and, of those, three hospitals are already set to be consolidated or relocated.
The hospitals named from Saga Prefecture are the National Hospital Organization East Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyaki-gun), Taku City Hospital (Taku), Ogi City Hospital (Ogi), JCHO Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari) and Tara-cho, Fujitsu-gun's Tara Town Hospital.
Of the five, Taku City Hospital and Ogi City Hospital are being merged and a plan is underway to build a new hospital in Higashitaku-cho, Taku, whereas Imari Matsuura Hospital is set to relocate to Matsuura in Nagasaki Prefecture.
Tara Town Hospital plays a central role in the town's comprehensive community care, and has been in the black for the past several years.
Commenting on the situation, Mayor Nagafuchi Takayuki said, "We have always run the hospital independently as a town, and are considering working with other hospitals in nearby towns. A hospital must be preserved for the sake of the citizens," expressing his negative view on the prospect of restructuring or merging.
The administrator of East Saga Hospital said that they are yet to hear anything from the prefecture, but did mention that they were in active talks at community healthcare coordination meetings, and intended to act based on those discussions.
The Japan Community Healthcare Organisation (Tokyo) that operates Imari Matsuura Hospital did not seem overly concerned, stating, "It is our understanding that this announcement does not automatically determine the direction of public hospitals, but is more of a request to reconsider the position of hospitals at community healthcare coordination meetings in each and every prefecture."
The person from the prefectural medical affairs department, who is responsible for explaining the state's way of thinking to each medical institution, made it plain that, "We want to carefully consider what the parties concerned have to say about future hospital management.
In some cases, we may ask hospitals to review their departments, or further reduce the number of beds."
Thirty suspected acts of bullying 3rd year junior high school boy in Gifu who fell to his death | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
An independent committee formed by the city, charged with investigating the circumstances surrounding a school boy (14) in the 3rd grade of junior high school who appeared to have committed suicide and left a note implying that he was being bullied, announced its findings on the 27th, revealing from the witness accounts of other pupils that there were around 30 suspected acts of bullying.
The committee will further examine to determine if these were actual instances of bullying.
The committee held their fifth meeting the same day, during which a committee member and a lawyer shared the results of the interviews with classmates with the rest of the committee.
According to the committee, the boy had been made to kneel in the toilets, and cash had been demanded from him.
Royal family secrets: Surprising guests who were frequent fliers on the Royal Plane reveal
As part of their royal duty, the Royal Family have to embark on hundreds of trips around the world in their lifetime.
This is usually made easier by the Royal Plane - a private aircraft which jets the family around the globe to important events and appearances.
Unsurprisingly, having their own private plane comes with its own perks.
Aside not having to wait in long security lines and an unlimited number of bags, it seems the Royal Family can invite onboard any guests they wish - including some unlikely passengers.
According to a recently premiered Channel 5 documentary, the Queen and Prince Phillip aren't the only frequent fliers aboard the Royal Plane.
During the programme 'Secrets of the Royal Flight', a former Navigator of the Queen's Flight revealed that there are also often a number of furrier guests alongside the family.
Bob Shields said: "Occasionally, as well as our very important royal passengers, we might have some very important royal dogs."
It's no surprise that the Queen might request her beloved pets to come along for the journey, as she is renowned for her deep affinity for Corgis.
From a young age Queen Elizabeth has been fond of the four legged creatures, rumoured to have owned more than 30 corgis since she was crowned Monarch.
In 2007 she is believed to have had five corgis named Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, and an additional four dachshund-corgi crossbreeds: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
Staff on board the Royal Plane certainly had their hands full.
The household member of staff would be seen taking the dogs to the grass and pleading with the dogs to please do their business before they went on board the aeroplane, continued Shields.
I am delighted to say we never had one accident.
The programme also revealed the shocking amount of luggage the Queen has been known to travel with while on duty.
According to the shows narrator: "For her 44,000 mile commonwealth tour in 1953 The Queen's luggage weighed 12 tonnes."
To put that into perspective, that is roughly the same as two large elephants.
However, the Queen isn't the only one with an affinity for fashion.
Reportedly the Duchess of Cambridge has her own preferences for transporting her fashion - rumoured to have a seat reserved for each of her dresses.

In this 31st edition, we are presenting items from Matuyama Yuki, a top table tennis player who won the inter-college competition at Aichi Institute of Technology, and winner of inter-high school group competition at Aichi Institute of Technology Meiden high school.
Matsuyama Yuki's table tennis gears
Grip style right shakehand grip back back Racket Inner force layer ALC (FL・butterfly) Rubber fore Dignics05 (Extra thick・butterfly) Back Dignics80 (Extra thick・butterfly) Favorite item wristbands *All gears as of July, 2019.
Matsuyama Yuki (21 years old) has been leading the student table tennis world.
He lead the team to group victories in each categories in middle school, high school and college.
Also, at the 2019 All Japan Championship, he was runner up in men's doubles, and his participation from T.T Saitama is confirmed for the second season of T league, opening at the end of august.
The goods used by Matsuyama are Inner force layer ALC (FL) as well as fore: Dignics05 (extra thick) and back: Dignics80 (extra thick).
Matsuyama's strength is at rallying in the middle and behind away from the table.
He used to use Tenergy, but has since switched his rubber after the arrival of Dignics, which allows aggressive plays that focuses on ball holding time when hitting.
In addition, Matsuyama's favorite item is the wristbands he wears during games.
He says, "In the past during the world tour, there was a situation where I over-swung the back. When I wore a wristband when that happened, I felt I could hit more compactly because my wrist were anchored and was hard to bend. At games, I tape my wrist, and wear my wristband so it doesn't bend at all. Although the wristband may just be an emotional anchor, lol”
Matsuyama, the sweeping victor who wins with sharp rallies from double hand drives.
Watch the explosive play in the 2nd season of T league.
Former Alabama congressman Jack Edwards dies at 91
Retired 10-term U.S. Rep. Jack Edwards of Alabama, who was in the first wave of Deep South Republicans, died Friday.
His family said through a spokesman that Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after a battle with pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was first elected to the U.S. House in 1965 as part of the first wave of Alabama Republicans elected to Congress as the party gained traction in the Deep South.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
In a statement released by his family, they said Edwards described his hopes for a return to civility when recently asked what kind of world he would like to leave his great grandchildren.
"My hope is that my great grandchildren will grow up in a country where civility will have been returned to common discourse and to the efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said according to the family statement.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and nation with the highest degree of integrity.
The governor said flags at the Alabama Capitol will be placed at half-staff in his honor.
"He was the epitome of a true public servant and was the ultimate statesman for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of our finest," Ivey said in a statement.
Deputy Minister of Defense tweets "This yakitori is delicious" evening before apology for helicopter accident | Politics and Society | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
The Tweet posted to Twitter by Deputy Minister Yamamoto on the evening of the 26th.
It was deleted around 11:30am the following morning.
Deputy Defense Minister Yamamoto Tomohiro , in Saga Prefecture to present a final report to explain the cause and give an apology for the accident that occurred last February in which a JSDF combat helicopter crashed into a house in Chiyoda-cho, Kanzaki, posted "This yakitori is delicious" to Twitter on the evening of the 26th after eating and drinking at a yakitori restaurant in the prefecture.
After meeting with the governor on the 27th, the post was deleted.
Yamamoto Tweeted "I've come to Saga Prefecture on a business trip tonight!" after 11:30pm on the 26th.
He also wrote, "This yakitori is delicious. If you come to Saga, make sure you try Atari chicken!" together with a photo of Iwata Kazuchika, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense, who was also present at the meal.
Yamamoto later corrected his Tweet to "Arita chicken".
When asked his opinion on it at a press conference after the cabinet meeting on the morning of the 27th, Defense Minister Kono Taro answered that he would "take a look at the Tweet".
On the afternoon of the 27th, after the explanation about the accident to the prefecture and the three municipalities concerned was over, Yamamoto stated in an interview to the press regarding the content of his Tweet, "If there was anyone that was offended by what I posted, that was not my intention."
He stressed that he had deleted it of his own volition, but declined to state whether or not he thought the Tweet was inappropriate.
One of the local government officials who had been briefed by Yamamoto on the 27th said, "What was he thinking about? I don't really get (what he intended)," shaking his head.
Yamamoto has been elected to the lower house four times in the Southern Kanto proportional representation elections.
He assumed his current office this month after a cabinet reshuffle.
In the helicopter accident, a girl in the house at the crash site was injured, and both pilots were killed.
Michelle Obama Calls Meghan Markle 'An Inspiration' In Adoring Instagram
Michelle Obama gave high praise to Meghan Markle in a sweet Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it."
The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.
"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.
"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited.
In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.
"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.
Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside.
Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping.
"The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot," she said.
So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work.
I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that.
Johnny's Jr. unit "Bi Shounen" show up at the Girls Award with performances of Arashi and Smap songs!
Glitter "Bi" stage attracts fans <Girls Award> (The Television) - Yahoo! News
Johnny's Jr.'s 6 member group "Bi Shounen" performed live at the "Rakuten Girls Award 2019 AUTUMN/WINTER" at Makuhari Messe in Chiba.
[see picture]
Fujii Naoki captivates audience with his idol smile
The event is Japan's largest fashion and music event and has been held every year since 2010.
Various models and artists have made appearances and the event has excited attendees with fashion runways and live performances.
When Bi Shounen, whose youthful members were all born in the 2000s, were announced as the secret artist, the venue rang with cheers.
The six members, Nasu Yuto, Sato Ryoga, Kanasashi Issei, Fujii Naoki, Ukisho Hidaka and Iwasaki Taisho (*the "Saki" kanji should be different) came down to the stage and proceeded along the runway in the middle of the stage to the fans.
With the cheers still not stopping they began with "Fire Storm".
Next was a cover of senior groups' medley of songs "Johnny's Medley", with popular songs like Arashi's "A-ra-shi" and SMAP's "Sekai ni Hitsotdu Dake no Hana" which livened up the venue.
At the end they closed with Bi Shounen's original song "Cosmic Melody", and concluded the 6 member's "king of idols"-like sparkling stage performance.
Trump hotel keeps liquor license despite character complaint
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Washington Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has dismissed a request to review whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its liquor license over its owner's character.
The agency ruled Wednesday that the complaint by three ministers, two retired judges and two rabbis lacked standing because most of them didn't live in or own property in the District.
The Washington Post reports this is the second time the complainants pushed for the revocation of the hotel's liquor license over a District law that says license applicants must be of "good character."
The initial complaint filed last summer says President Donald Trump violates that law, citing assault allegations and patterns of deception.
It was killed because the license had already been granted.
The second complaint was prompted by the license's renewal.
The first harvest of honey from the "Flying Bees", honeybees kept by Bentley
What does the honey collected by the bees raised under the wing of the Flying B taste like?
Permanent beekeeping began on the site of the Bentley factory in Crewe in May 2019, and honey was harvested for the first time in September of that year.
The bees are just as hardworking as the staff working at the Crewe factory, producing enough honey to fill over 100 jars between just two hives.
But why did Bentley start keeping bees on the same site as the factory that assembles its cars?
You'll want to try this!
Click here to see Bentley's honey (11 photos)
Bentley's member of the board for manufacturing, Peter Bosch, explains.
"In order to do our part in conserving the biodiversity of the local area, we installed two beehives on the expansive grounds of the Crewe factory for the first time at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers have watched over the bees as they gathered nectar from the wildflowers growing onsite and in the nearby fields and hills.
We realized that this location is ideal for beekeeping, and it's wonderful to have ended up with such a large amount of honey in the first year.
Through our efforts at the Crewe factory and in our other business activities, Bentley is committed to a wide range of activities as the lead sustainable car manufacturer, and beekeeping is just one example.
The staff are also actively getting involved.
We are delighted to have had a successful first harvest, and plan to install more hives next year, so that we can increase the yield of Bentley honey.
This is a first small step towards conserving the biodiversity of the local area.
We will also continue with various initiatives appropriate for our role." Bentley started its beekeeping with 120,000 "Flying Bees" in May 2019.
One summer later, in September, the frames were removed from the hive and put in a centrifuge, and the resulting honey was then filtered and jarred.
The honey jars and packaging also exhibit Bentley's characteristic commitment to detail.
The label was designed by Bentley's interior designer, Louise McCallum.
The jars of honey are not only shared with employees, but are also given as gifts to important guests and customers when they visit the Crewe factory.
England is a country that places great importance on the custom of afternoon tea.
It seems like it would be nice to enjoy some "Flying Bees" honey with a scone and a cup of fennel tea that goes well with honey.
Scandal-hit Cleveland Police force branded the worst in Britain in damning report - The Sun
A SCANDAL-HIT police force has been branded Britain's worst by inspectors.
Cleveland Police was rated as inadequate in all areas in a damning report.
HM's Inspectorate of Constabulary Phil Gormley says Cleveland Police force has seen 'significant deterioration'
The force, which has had five chief constables in six years, is now facing fresh calls for it to be disbanded.
The report found it was failing in efforts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the vulnerable.
HM's Inspectorate of Constabulary Phil Gormley said: "There has been a significant deterioration since our last inspection."
Chief Constable Mike Veale quit in January after less than a year while facing an investigation into "serious" but undisclosed allegations about his behaviour.
Assistant Chief Constable Adrian Roberts is suspended after being arrested on suspicion of gross misconduct.
Last year Det Insp Simon Hurwood appeared before a misconduct panel for grooming colleagues for sex.
He quit the force.
Tees Valley's Tory Mayor Ben Houchen said: "This is official validation that the force is broken.
It's now time for the Home Office to intervene."
Chief Constable Richard Lewis said: "Improvements have been made and I take full responsibility for driving through change."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr has 'gone rogue' and impeachment investigation needs to take its course
You never know where we're going next.
Now, I think we're getting involved in the coverup of the coverup, and that may be something that will take some time to investigate," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.
"They will do the work that they're set out to do, following the facts and the time that it takes to find the facts," she said.
A White House transcript released this week showed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and Biden's son.
Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani on the issue, the call transcript revealed.
Trump has denied he did anything improper.
CNN reported on Thursday that Justice Department national security lawyers were first alerted to the whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal referral.
After receiving the complaint as a referral from the intelligence community officials, the DOJ determined that Trump's phone call did not warrant a campaign finance criminal investigation.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call as witnesses.
But she added that she believes Barr "has gone rogue."
He has for a long time now.
"Since (Barr) was mentioned in all of this," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general on the July call with Ukraine's leader.
It's curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.
Pelosi said she's "very worried" about the whistleblower's sources, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies and suggested that in the old days spies were dealt with differently.
I think what the President said goes beyond irresponsible, it's dangerous.
Our whistleblowers have an important role to play in unfolding -- revealing wrongdoing in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "For the President to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal impeachment inquiry over the allegations that he attempted to pressure a foreign leader for political gain.
The phone call was included in a complaint publicly released Thursday, in which a whistleblower alleged Trump abused his powers to "solicit interference" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information.
Christian Benteke: Crystal Palace striker faces driving ban for speeding
Premier League star Christian Benteke is facing a possible driving ban after he was caught speeding twice in two months.
The Crystal Palace striker, 28, has admitted driving his Bentley at 80mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 in Richmond, south west London, on January 20.
The Belgian was then flashed by speed cameras at 89mph, more than double the 40mph limit, in Putney, south west London, in March.
Benteke, of Kingston Hill, Surrey, is not required to be present at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court this morning.
He pleaded guilty to both offences at the start of July under the single justice procedure, where minor offences are decided by a magistrate sitting alone.

Ghana: Kofi Manu Concerned Over Structure of Vetting Committee
Mr. Kofi Manu, a football administrator and an official of Sekondi Hasaacas has raised concerns over the composition of the Vetting Committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.
He questioned the inclusion of the Committee's Chairman, Mr. Frank Davies, adding that he was not happy with his inclusion.
Mr. Manu in an interview with the GNA Sport said, he had doubts the Chairman of the Committee would be fair since he had interest in the outcome of the vetting process.
The Vetting Committee should be neutral people from outside who have not shown affiliation with any member and who have not shown interest before.
For instance, Mr. Davies was contracted by the NC as a lawyer to write to Osei Kwaku Palmer concerning a 10 per cent payment.
He is also a known Olympics supporter.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to serve on the vetting committee because he has interest," he argued.
Mr. Manu said there would be conflict of interest on the Chairman's part if Mr. Fred Pappoe, a Director of Olympics appear before the Committee because of his affiliation to the club whilst suggesting there would be prejudice and partiality towards Mr. Palmer if he appeared before the Committee.
Members of the Committee were expected to begin work from yesterday and end on October 4 after being sworn in at a ceremony held at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Thursday September 19.
The chairman of the Committee is Mr. Frank Davies with Corporate Governance Consultant and legal practitioner, Mrs. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah as members.
Other members are Mr. Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Executive and Mr. Richard Akpokavie, a Sports Administrator and Legal Practitioner.
Regarding the government's target of raising the minimum wage to 1,000 yen per hour, an investigation carried out by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54.2% of small to medium businesses in Fukui Prefecture think that the minimum wage can be 1,000 yen.
Despite 90% of businesses carrying out recruitment drives in the 2018 financial year, of the companies that said they were able to secure the required number of labourers, regular employees - whether recently graduated or switching jobs mid-career - made up around 50% of this amount, whilst the recruitment of non-regular employees accounted for 30%, exposing the emerging struggle for companies to secure labour.
Of the companies who answered that they were in favour of raising the hourly wage to 1,000 yen, IT-related (100%), construction (70.6%) and wholesale (61.7%) companies were in the majority.
Conversely, respondents with a majority opposed to this move came from the manufacturing (51.9%) and hospitality - including dining and accommodation (60.9%) industries, whereas the transportation industry was split 50/50 for and against.
According to a representative from the Chamber of Commerce, "The kinds of industries with a lot of part-time workers or staff paid by the hour tended to be more opposed to the idea, but as it is difficult to secure personnel, many companies are actually looking to increase their labour costs."
The hourly wage deemed acceptable by companies opposed to the increase to 1,000 yen averaged to 895 yen (In Fukui Prefecture, it is 829 yen from October 4th).
When asked about the state of recruitment in March 2019, 61.3% of companies hired recently graduated regular employees, 54.5% hired workers switching jobs mid-career, and 15.4% hired non-regular employees.
8.6% did not recruit at all.
Of the companies that said they were able to secure the required number of employees, recent graduates accounted for 44.7%, workers switching jobs mid-career accounted for 50.3%, and non-regular employees accounted for 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (13.3% new graduates, 37.5% mid-career) and the construction industry (24.1% new graduates, 38.1% mid-career) struggled.
Overall, 86.4% of the companies encountered issues in the recruitment process, with the most commonly cited problems being the low number of applicants, the relatively unknown status of the company, and the inability to offer better wage conditions, respectively.
Many expressed the wish for the government to update its policy regarding employment activity, asking for more information sharing and strengthened recruitment programs for second-wave graduates (employees who leave a position within three years of graduating) and mid-career employees.
Others suggested the need to boost the approach towards students through the support of various internships and the provision of PR opportunities to encourage students from outside the prefecture.
Regarding second jobs and side business as advocated by the national growth strategy, 15.3% of companies responded that they had already approved of this.
Including the 20.3% of respondents who indicated that they planned to approve of this in the future, this reveals that one third of all respondents showed an approving attitude.
64.4% of companies answered that they did not approve, with the highest percentage coming from the construction industry (82.8%), retail industry (73.1%) and manufacturing industry (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19th to August 2nd, targeting 1,000 member companies.
Of those, responses were received from 298 companies (29.8%).
Services to be resumed from the first train on the JR Omura line that was damaged by the typhoon (KTN Television Nagasaki) - Yahoo!News
The JR Omura line, on which operations had been suspended due to damage sustained from Typhoon Tapah, reopened on the 27th from the first train.
The JR Omura line, which connects directly to the Sasebo line and the Nagasaki main line, returned to normal service from the first train in the morning on the 27th.
A section of track between Kawatana Station and Sonogi Station was damaged when the typhoon caused a river dike running alongside the track to burst, washing away the ballast.
In addition to a suspended service between Takematsu Station and Haiki Station, fewer JR trains were running in Nagasaki Prefecture, leading to a disruption of the normal train schedule.
According to the JR Kyushu Nagasaki branch office, repair work was completed on the 26th, and then reopened on the 27th after doing a test run in the early morning.
Tipuric issues rallying call ahead of Aussie showdown
Justin Tipuric says "it is time to perform" when Wales face a World Cup showdown against Australia that could shape their destiny in the tournament.
Victory for Wales against the Wallabies would install them as red-hot favourites to win Pool D and secure a likely quarter-final appointment with France or Argentina.
But if Australia beat Wales for a 14th time in the last 15 meetings, it could send Tipuric and company hurtling towards a last-eight clash against England.
"There is no bones about it, both teams want to try and get through and finish top of the group," Wales flanker Tipuric said.
There have been some tough results in the past, but it was nice to get a win last autumn against them (Australia).
I think they will be chomping at the bit to get that back from us, and we want to make sure we get another win.
Before we even came in here, you knew this was going to be a big one.
Now we are here, it's time to perform, really.
Wales have only claimed one victory against Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - and that was 32 years ago in a third-place play-off when they toppled the Wallabies.
And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows just seven wins from 41 attempts at the hands of the three southern hemisphere heavyweights.
Wales halted a 13-Test losing sequence at Australia's hands last November, with Tipuric set to be among several survivors from that 9-6 success who run out at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Asked if there had been a mental block prior to that win, Tipuric added: "It's tough to say.
Those games are so tight, there is maybe... people would expect there was a bit of a mental block, I don't know.
In the end in the last game we probably left about 15 points out there, so it made the scoreline look a lot closer than it actually was."
If Wales are to triumph, then Tipuric's battle at the breakdown with Australia's revered back-row double act Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial.
The 67 times-capped Tipuric has encountered both players on several previous occasions, and he knows exactly what is coming.
"They are absolutely world-class sevens," he said.
When you play against world-class back-rowers you always know you are going to be in for a tough game.
Those two are consistently up there with the best in the world.
You know what type of game you are going to be in for.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world over the ball defensively - and Michael is more of an attacking seven and probably has a bit more of a rugby brain to be in the right place at the right time.
You would rather play the best players in the world and challenge yourself, rather than face a back-row that isn't as good.
You want to play against the best, and you know against those two you will have to be on form.
I wouldn't say that Sunday is so much a cup final, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
Momentum is an important part of it.
If you keep on building and putting in good performances, you are going to be flying and tough to beat.
"A surprise result", locals hold their heads in silence as Ireland go out of the World Cup in a shocking defeat | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
28th: local fans in a pub in the Irish capital of Dublin have grim expressions on their faces as they watch their team struggle in the Rugby World Cup match against Japan (pool photo)
Dublin: In the home country of the strong team that lost out to Japan in the Rugby World Cup on the 28th, fans that had flocked to pubs in the morning to support their team now hold their heads speechless at the unexpected defeat.
The public broadcaster RTE couldn't even hide their emotions, saying it was "an amazingly unexpected result from brave Japan".
The match started just after 8am local time in Ireland.
Despite being so early in the morning, many fans had gathered at a pub in the capital of Dublin that is jointly managed by the fullback Rob Kearney.
Everyone was convinced of victory before the game started, but as their lead slipped away in the final moments of the game, there were increasing shouts of "No!"
When the whistle was blown at the end of the match, the pub was shrouded in silence.
TEPCO proposes procedure for releasing water into the ocean, with reputation damage control in mind | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Meeting of the government subcommittee at Minato Ward, Tokyo on the afternoon of the 27th, discussing how to dispose of the treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
TEPCO representatives met at a government subcommittee on the 27th to discuss what to do with the ever increasing amount of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, presenting the equipment and specific procedure deemed necessary in the cases of releasing it into the ocean and evaporation into the atmosphere, both of which have been proven as disposal methods both in Japan and overseas.
To reign in and curb any misinformation, due to radioactive materials such as tritium being present in the water, TEPCO says they will check the concentration, and if any abnormality is detected before release, they would perform an emergency shutdown.
Regarding the procedures proposed in the meeting, committee members said they would like clarification on how much time it will take, and pointed out that the significance of releasing into the ocean would change depending on whether Fukushima's fishing industry was still in an unrecovered state, or if it was done once it had been restored somewhat.
Therefore it was said that TEPCO also needs to consider the timeline of society.
EastEnders spoilers: Ben kisses Callum after Whitney's bombshell
The sizzling tension between Callum Highway (Tony Clay) and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) is set to explode once more in EastEnders as a sudden bombshell from Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) leaves Callum thrown - and leads him back into the arms of his lover.
But will they commence a relationship or will they regret their heated moment?
Since Callum helped to save Ben's life and then also stepped up for a struggling Bobby Beale (Clay Milner Russell), he and Ben have been taking things slowly but have been flirting with the idea of going on a date, with Callum recently telling Ben that it was nice to see his vulnerable and softer side.
Tonight, Whitney returns from her holiday in a much better frame of mind than she left.
It's clearly done her the world of good to get away from Walford in the wake of her disastrous wedding and the revelation that her husband-to-be had cheated on her.
As she arrives home, she ends up having a heart to heart with Callum.
But soon, she hits him with a revelation that leaves him reeling.
As Callum reacts badly, Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick) is concerned to see him knocking back the booze in the Queen Vic.
Drunk and emotional, Callum marches round to Ben's and confronts him over everything that has happened, blaming him.
Ben is calm and accepts the outburst before offering solace to Callum and before long, Callum's frustration turns into passion as they share a kiss.
But where will they go from here?
The couple will attempt a date next week but after Ben is given food for thought over his relationship history, it threatens to derail everything that the couple are working towards.
But after standing up to his homophobic dad, a newly confident Callum is determined to fight for what he wants - and deserves.
EastEnders airs the kiss on Friday 27th September at 8:30pm on BBC One.
Is it true that if Yoshimoto Kogyo takes “90% of guarantee”, it would be considered as gifts from Entertainers?
In a series of problems at Yoshimoto Kogyo, triggered by shady business with anti-social forces, the problems surrounding guarantees are also attracting attention.
At a press conference on July 22nd, president Okamoto Akihiko said, "there is no such thing as the company getting 90% and entertainers getting 10%", and states that on average is “5:5 or 6:4", but entertainers are rallying against that.
There are opinions by investors on Twitter that if Yoshimoto take 90% on the “9:1” ratio, then it will be considered to be a gift from the entertainers to Yoshimoto which is taxable, and this has been re-tweeted over 30,000 times.
If the share of guarantee is "9:1", will there be a gift tax?
We have asked certified tax accountant, Yuki Ando.
●Corporations are not subjected to gift tax in the first place
Putting aside the issue of distribution rate of the guarantee, I will answer this from a tax accountant's perspective.
Yoshimoto Kogyo is a corporation and not an individual, and they are not subject to gift tax in the first place.
Say for example the distribution of a 1 million yen job is "9:1"; Yoshimoto Kogyo's revenue will be 1 million yen, expense would be 100 thousand yen and profit will be 900 thousand yen.
That would be subject to corporate tax.
I am sure they filed like so and have paid their corporate tax.
Also, it’s not like the entertainers are saying what they actually received is not what they should be receiving, even if they have doubt regarding distribution rate.
And I think they are filing taxes depending on how much they have actually received.
Gift is about both parties acting on the understanding of “giving and receiving XX amount”, hence if the giver (entertainer) does not recognize that, it would not become a gift even if the counterpart was an individual.
If you trade something that clearly has a price (e.g. buying or selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original market price to avoid paying taxes, there would be a problem with calculating tax.
However, for cases such as this, where both parties have been transacting without any conflict, it will be hard for a third party to decide what the appropriate price is from a taxation point of view.
I personally feel sorry for the 1yen payment record, though.
[Contributing Tax Accountant] Ando Yuki Certified Tax accountant After graduating from university and working for a bank, she registered as a tax accountant in 2008. (Passed five courses including bookkeeping, finance statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, and inheritance tax law)

'Total panic' as White House struggles to find impeachment footing
White House officials were scrambling to figure out how to counter the renewed Democratic impeachment push Thursday, with one source familiar with the situation describing a sense of "total panic" over the past week at the lack of a plan to address the new reality.
There appears to be rising "anxiety, unease, and concern" - as one person close to the White House described the mood in the West Wing - that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously wound the president and some of those around him.
"There's not a lot of confidence that there's no there there," this person said.
White House officials remained unsure of how to proceed, not only because is there no apparent plan for the situation, but because the allegations are so serious that the usual methods the president has used to successfully escape past controversies may not apply: "This doesn't look like something that's going to be overtaken by the next news cycle," the person quipped.
Another person familiar with the discussions described the mood inside the White House as "shell-shocked," with increasing wariness that as this impeachment inquiry drags out, the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become "unmanageable."
That concern was echoed by another source, who said some around the president anticipate he will engage in more "impulsive" behavior, with pressure expected to build on him daily during the impeachment inquiry.
That's sparking worries that Trump could display increasingly unpredictable behavior and lash out in unexpected ways - both a presidential and a political concern in an election year environment.
With his presidency facing what may be its biggest threat yet, Trump has cycled from offense to defense, reviving a strategy that he viewed as effective during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
He tried to downplay his request for the Ukrainian president to help investigate his political rivals, to divert attention to actions by Democrats and presidential contender Joe Biden, and to discredit the whistleblower as having partisan motives.
But while many in the White House are battle-tested from the Mueller investigation, this time is starting to feel different, aides and advisers said.
For a president whose brand is viewed as strength, Wednesday's press conference made him look defeated, said one person familiar with the situation.
While Trump relished questions on the Russia investigation, he seemed to be in no mood to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some allies of the president believe the damage could be mitigated, with some seizing on the fact that the whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the controversial call in question between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - a fact which they argue damages his or her credibility.
And, as often happens, when the president is under siege, that fact energizes his core supporters in his defense.
But one Republican strategist close to the White House points out that the president's base approval ratings are already sky-high - and impeachment will do little to win over new supporters.
"There is no upside to having the next four months focused on the president's impeachment," particularly if it stymies his legislative agenda and dominates the news cycle.
Another of the sources said that those who were arguing impeachment could help the president weren't fully grasping how much of a wild card his response could be.
Worried White House officials have been reaching out to advisers for help in assembling an impeachment response team.
With the effort still in the early phases, it remained unclear whether any type of war room-style effort would come to fruition or what form it might take, according to a person briefed on the plans.
But there was an acknowledgement that a coordinated legal and communications strategy was needed, with a clear leader able to marshal a public relations offensive to counter the release of the scathing whistleblower report and the momentum its release has given Democratic impeachment efforts, that person said.
The lack of a long-term strategic vision has been starkly visible, as when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin indicated they were not going to release the memo describing Trump's call with the Ukrainian president - and then 48 hours later, feeling there was no choice but to release the document, according the source familiar with the situation.
It is anticipated there will be more pressure now than during the investigation by Robert Mueller, who was mostly silent, speaking only through his indictments. One person who may become involved in developing an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, Trump's outside pit bull and former campaign manager, said the person involved in the matter.
But Lewandowski told NBC News it was not accurate to suggest he would lead such an effort.
"For the last five years, I've done everything I can to support the president and his agenda," he said, "but I have had no discussions with president and his team at all about joining a team to push back on this fake impeachment narrative."
Trump's outside lawyer from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also remaining involved in the impeachment efforts.
"We will deal with matters as appropriate," Sekulow said when reached by NBC News for comment.
The White House currently lacks a lawyer experienced in impeachment now that Emmet Flood, who worked on the Clinton impeachment and guided the White House through the end of the Mueller investigation, has left, with current White House counsel Pat Cipollone lacking that type of experience.
One source familiar with the White House strategy said that overall, officials were nowhere near the point of bringing people on board or setting up war rooms - but acknowledge they need a coordinated, all hands-on-deck response effort and someone who can lead a political fight, the person said.

If that's not enough, the whole family can go head to head in a game of glow-in-the-dark laser tag at the ship's "studio B," which impressively doubles as an ice-skating rink.
While sailing the Mediterranean seas, guests will also have the chance to explore exotic flavours from around the world, thats a diverse expansion of the restaurants onboard.
Updated Asian cuisine is on offer at the ship's Izumi restaurants, meanwhile a modern take on traditional Italian cuisine will offer the finest food in a casual setting at the brand new Giovanni's Italian Kitchen.

With a choice of seven and nine night itineraries, the cruise is due to depart from Rome in May 2020.
As Royal Caribbean's second European ship, it will join Allure of the Seas which has also recently undergone a jaw-dropping transformation.
Following the Allure's 58-day makeover, which totalled a whopping $165million, the cruise operator gave guests who booked early a bonus $300 worth of onboard spending money.
According to the cruise operator: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth ship in the Voyager Class to be transformed as part of the cruise line's Royal Amplified fleet modernisation effort."
An investment of more than $1 billion, across 10 ships in four years, the programme touches every facet of the guest experience and introduces a wide range of thrilling adventures spanning one-of-a-kind attractions and experiential dining and nightlife.
Resolution required for long-distance relationship success rate only 16% Morikawa Tomoyoshi (Nikkei doors) - Yahoo! News
Published 9/6 (Fri) 13:51
Finally got a boyfriend, but because of his work we are in a long distance relationship.
He said "Let's get married someday" but I can't see that goal and feel gloomy.
How can I make the best of the situation and lead this to nuptial?
Nikkei doors editor asked professor Morikawa Tomoyoshi, lecturer on "romance studies" at Waseda University, for solutions.
This is a must-read as Morikawa professor's advice comes from exhaustive data analysis.
Today's problem
I'm wondering if I should continue my relationship with my long distance boyfriend.
I would like to continue living in Kansai where my parents' house and my job are, but he works in Tokyo.
He works for a trading company, so there is a possibility of him being assigned abroad in the future.
He says, "let's get married someday", but I cannot see the goal.
What should I do?
23 years old, manufacturing company, office worker
●Long distance couples who end up marrying are only a minority
Nikkei doors editing section (hereon "--") : Ms. C has been dating her boyfriend for 1.5 years and they are in a long distance relationship.
There is a saying "distance makes the two of us strong", but does a long distance relationship really work?
Professor. Morikawa Tomoyoshi (hereon "Morikawa"): When it comes to long distance relationships, a survey that was conducted by DeNA Travel (August 2017, 1147 people replied) is famous, and according to that data, only 16% of couples in long distance relationships ended up marrying.
Love is something that uses five senses, looking at (sight), listening to (hearing), holding hands (touch), inhaling scent (smell) and kissing (taste) are fundamentally what allows for deeper relationship.
However, in case of long distance relationships, it's mostly just hearing a partner's voice over the phone.
There is a possibility that continuing the relationship by hearing only is too difficult.
Also, there is the issue of cost.
When visiting a partner’s house, transportation cost and travel time are burdensome and take effort; when it should be a day off to refresh oneself, one ends up being exhausted.
You would feel lonely when you are heading home.
-- : So if it looks like it's going to be a long distance relationship, the only way is to break-up?
Morikawa: For couples who can tolerate not seeing each other often, and for those whose separation time is predetermined, it will work out.
For example, getting engaged after a year or being transferred back after 2 years.
In situations where you can't see where you are in the future, it may be difficult.

Devin Nunes Accuses Democrats Of Wanting 'Nude Pictures Of Trump'
Congressman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) apparently can't "bare" the thought of President Donald Trump being investigated.
And in his defense of the president on Thursday, he accused Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of the president.
Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, made the accusation during his opening statement at the hearing about the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought Ukrainian help in investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukraine scandal a "grotesque spectacle" created by the left and their "media assets" before claiming the Democrats wanted to see photos of the president in the buff:
"Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
People can reasonably ask why the Democrats are so determined to impeach this president when in just a year, they will have a chance.
After Nunes finished his dressing-down, HuffPost senior political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to find out if Democratic politicians are trying to get to the, um, bottom of this.
So far, only Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes (D) has responded, but we suspect his answer is the naked truth for many of his colleagues as well.
Mediaite.com suspects Nunes' clothing-optional comments were a reference to "some of the more salacious and unconfirmed details" that supposedly appear in the controversial Steele Dossier.
That's the infamous collection of explosive allegations against Trump compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that mentions the possible existence of a "pee tape," which allegedly shows him watching sex workers engage in "golden showers" in a Moscow hotel room.

A memorial event took place on September 7th at Awina Osaka to celebrate the singer Ogasawara Mitsuko , honorary president of the Japan-North Korea Musical Arts Cultural Exchange Society and receiver of the North Korean Friendship Medal First Class, who passed away July of this year, aged 100.
People connected to Ogasawara performed some of her best-known songs.
Fellow citizens such as Pu Yong Ku, committee chairman of the Osaka headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, were in attendance, as well as approximately 140 Japanese officials, including Ikebe Yukie, chairwoman of the Japan-North Korea Musical Arts Cultural Exchange Society.
Chairwoman Ikebe gave a speech at the beginning of the event.
She spoke of how she still couldn't believe that Ogasawara was dead, and expressed regret for the loss when she mentioned how preparations for the memorial event had keenly reminded her of just how great and wonderful a person Ogasawara was.
She also shared her hopes, saying, "I hope we can do something to expand the society, even if only a little."
After a silent prayer was offered, a message was read out from Ogami Kenichi, executive head of the North Korean Musical Arts Cultural Exchange Society and the International Institute of the Juche Idea.
Potential renewable biofuel research could help lower emissions
While electric cars and Tesla semi-trucks have dominated the headlines in recent years, one thing flies seemingly out of the reach of renewable energy: airplanes.
But a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that could allow renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences who began this project in 2003.
His lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes like restaurant grease, animal renderings, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils in its production, allowing it to not only release an estimated 85 per cent less carbon emissions than petroleum-based fuels, but also utilizing wastes from other industries in the process.
The technology works to mimic the hydrocarbons present in petroleum-based fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," Bressler said. "is [actually make] the hydrocarbons which are the exact molecules in diesel gasoline."
While this presents a new option for biofuel use, previously produced biofuel technologies tend to de-stabilize at lower temperatures, which, for an aircraft travelling at high altitudes, poses a serious problem.
"The problem with jet fuel is it's a bit of a catch-22," Bressler said.
It's actually worth less than diesel but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's lab is currently looking at two options for producing jet biofuel.
The first being a low-risk approach which requires giving their hydrocarbon biofuel another treatment and adding in hydrogen.
The second option is to continue work on already partially developed chemistry which would keep the fuel stable, even at lower temperatures.
"We can actually play some games with the chemistry in our reactor to try to change the chemistry a little bit," Bressler said about the second option.
That one's a higher risk.
The University of Alberta spin-off company Forge Hydrocarbons is working on commercializing the product as airlines and both the Canadian and American militaries are increasingly investing in the renewable option.
"They can see [a] future where one day somebody might turn around and charge them a carbon tax," he said.
They want an alternative in place that is a fallback position.
Currently, Forge runs a pilot plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Centre and recently acquired a US$4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to support the construction of a $25-million production facility to be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The facility is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel each year.
Bressler also notes while estimates for carbon reductions are around 85 per cent, aspects such as how the fuel is transported and produced are reasons for why carbon reductions aren't higher.
"As a technology guy," Bressler said.
My job is to create options so there can be an informed decision and multiple choices on which to go with.
Shida's attractions made into a card game, 3rd-year pupils at Shimada Shosei High School solicit online funding for production costs | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Fukushima (left) and his classmates engaged in the creation of a local card game, Shimada Shosei High School, Shimada
Five 3rd-year pupils from Shimada Shosei High School, Shimada, have been working on the creation of a local card game featuring traditional events and tourist attractions in the Shida area, such as the Shimada Grand Festival and Horai Bridge.
They are raising their production costs through a round of crowdfunding that will last until October 15th, and once the decks are complete, they are considering free distribution to local kindergartens and medical rehabilitation facilities.
The five pupils involved with the project are Fukushima Hiryu (18), Nakamura Taiyo (18), Mizushima Ryu (17), Kato Shoji (17) and Masuda Reiki (17).
The five of them have been working on the project since December last year, with the desire to "tell lots of people about what makes the area great".
The photos used for the picture cards were either taken on location, or received from the city hall.
They are near completion, with an accompanying description explaining the history and highlights attached to the back of each picture card.
Fukushima said, "I want children to enjoy them in particular," and another pupil added, "It could even lead to local people discovering new charms about the area," as their hopes swell near completion.
The crowdfunding goal is 300,000 yen, and if they do not reach this amount before the deadline, the pupils plan to refund the whole amount.

High school entrance examinations 2020: Hokkaido to abolish the gender section from the application form for public high school entrance examinations (ReseMom) - Yahoo!News
On September 26th, 2019, the Hokkaido Board of Education published an admissions guidebook for new students hoping to enter its public high schools in the 2020 academic year.
At the same time, they confirmed that they have made the decision to abolish the gender section from high school application forms, a move that was made in consideration of transgender pupils taking the entrance examinations, and other pupils whose mental and physical genders do not match.
Admissions schedule
The admissions guidebook for new students entering Hokkaido public high schools contains everything that hopeful students need, including the admissions schedule, number of applicants to be admitted, application requirements, application process, application changes, examination of academic ability, the announcement of results and reference material.
It includes all the necessary information on admissions for ordinary students, recommendation based admissions, students entering a public high school from an affiliated junior high school, and students applying from outside the prefecture.
Up until 2019, a gender section was provided on the application form, but in light of the need to more appropriately take into account individual sexual orientation and diversity of gender identity, the gender section will be removed from the 2020 application forms.
The five areas of academic ability that general admission students will be tested on are Japanese, mathematics, social studies, science and English.
An English listening test is included in the English examination time.
The examination time for each subject is 50 minutes.
That time is made up of five minutes at the beginning for instructions and giving out papers, and 45 minutes for answering.
There are 60 marks available in each subject
The admissions schedule for students hoping to enter a public high school in Hokkaido in the 2020 academic year is as follows: applications for general admission will be accepted from January 21st, 2020 until noon on the 24th, changes to applications will be accepted from January 29th until 4pm on February 4th, the examination of academic ability will be on March 4th with the results being announced at 10am on March 17th; the second round of applications will be accepted from March 23rd until 4:30pm on the 24th, and the examination results from the second round will be announced on March 27th.
For recommendation based admissions and students from affiliated schools, applications will be accepted from January 21st, 2020 until noon on the 24th with interviews commencing on February 13th and notification of offers going out on February 20th; recommendation based admission students who did not receive a place can apply again from February 21st until noon on the 26th.
Boris Johnson's allies warn Britain faces LA-style RIOTS if Brexit is reversed as PM calls for calm.
A senior cabinet minister last night said the country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the original result.
The Prime Minister's senior allies warned the UK faces civil unrest on the scale of the yellow vest protests in France over economic inequalities and Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Mr Johnson said "tempers need to come down" in the furious row over political language - but insisted he won't stop using the word "surrender."
Despite his appeal for calm, a cabinet minister told The Times: "In this country we never had the gilets jaunes [yellow vests] or the LA riots [in 1992].
People don't think it's possible in this country just because it has not happened before.
Now they have a model - gilets jaunes - they have encrypted phones to co-ordinate it, and it only takes a couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people.
Riots in erupted in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four white police officers for beating up a black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.
Earlier this year, anti-government French protesters wearing yellow high visibility vests - gilet jaunes have been wrought havoc and destruction on the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister pointed to Mr Johnson's warning in the Commons that there would be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system" if Britain failed to leave the EU.
"If we have a referendum with 30 million people who vote, and we vote Remain by 66 per cent, that's ten million people who are unhappy," said the minister.
Even if 99 per cent of them shrug it off, that's still 100,000 really angry people who will write to their MP and not let it go.
It doesn't take much and soon you have tens of thousands of people on the street.
A senior cabinet minister added that country risked a "violent, popular uprising" if a second referendum overturned the result of the first one.
Mr Johnson has called for there to be a general election to allow voters to settle Brexit.
It has been reported he is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU instead.
Niigata Albirex BB pray for victory before the start of the B league (Niigata Prefecture) (TeNY TV Niigata) - Yahoo!News
On the 27th, with less than a week to go before the start of the B league, players from Niigata Albirex BB went to pray for victory.
Players and staff visited Furumachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata on the morning of the 27th, where they made their prayers for victory.
Last season, Niigata won the first regional championship in the club's history.
However, after the season was over, top scorer Davante Gardner moved to another team in the B league.
This season the team will welcome another player from overseas, Nick Perkins, as they hope to improve on their results compared to last season.
Captain Uzawa Jun commented, "It's important for us to reach the kind of speeds the head coach is looking for and strengthen our defense more than last season so that we can surpass last seasons championship result."
Niigata's first game will be an away game against Alvark Tokyo on October 5th (Sat).
Pakistan social media star's brother gets life for her 'honour' murder
Women's rights experts say that enforcement of justice is often lax, with proceedings at times being drawn out while accused killers were freed on bail and cases faded away.
"It takes too long, people forget," said Farzana Bari, a women's rights advocate and founder of Pakistan's first gender studies department at a university, adding that even the high-profile Baloch case had taken over three years to be resolved.
Though rights groups say reliable data is hard to establish, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan found at least 300 cases of "honour killing" in 2018.
Many advocates say the actual number is far higher, with the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network estimating that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honour killings globally each year.
130 million yen to be spent to combat classical swine fever, Shizuoka Prefecture to amend budget in September (Sankei Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
It was reported at a parliamentary steering committee on the 26th that the prefecture will add a supplementary budget of 148 million yen in September, consisting of 136 million yen to go on emergency measures to combat classical swine fever, and 12 million yen in expenses related to the decision-making required for land acquisition in the track elevation project at JR Numazu Station.
This amendment will then be brought to the prefectural assembly on the 27th.
The September supplement will bring the total amount to 8 billion 187 million yen.
The decision has been made in response to fresh outbreaks of swine fever in Saitama Prefecture and other areas, and three new disinfection points for lorries transporting livestock will be set up close to the Kanto area in Gotemba, Fujinomiya and Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka, in addition the one established at Kosai.
The supplemental budget includes 77.4 million yen for expenses related to this.
In addition, to prevent the disease spreading via wild boars, thought to be one of the main routes of infection, efforts will be made to capture wild boar in areas other than the western part of the prefecture and check that they have not been infected.
58.6 million yen has been apportioned to capturing and testing 1,560 boars in the central and eastern parts of the prefecture.
Regarding the decision-making process involved in elevating the track at Numazu Station, the funds will go on requesting a land valuation for the site being eyed for acquisition and additional operating expenses for the requisition committee.
According to the office of the requisition committee, a request made by the prefecture and Numazu on the 18th asking for the expropriation of unpurchased land was received on the 19th.
The documents included with the request will be inspected at Numazu City Hall from October the 3rd to the 17th, and it is expected that the decision-making process will begin immediately after this step is complete.
Soja mayoral election announced on 29th Probability of no voting for the first time in eight years: Sanyo Newspaper Digital | San-digi
As the current mayor's term of office comes to an end, an election for the next mayor of Soja will be announced on the 29th.
At this point in time, only the independent Kataoka Soichi (60), who is aiming for his fourth election victory, has announced his candidacy.
As there is no hint that anyone else will be running for election, it is looking increasingly likely that there will be no voting for the first time in eight years.
Soja is in the midst of implementing a reconstruction plan after the heavy rains that hit western Japan (due to last from 2019 to 2023), so what will be called into question is whether any candidate is able to satisfactorily deliver restoration and disaster prevention under fierce financial conditions.
Other pressing matters include the need to promote the suburbs where the population is in serious decline, and improve the circulation of tourists to sightseeing areas.
Candidates wish to put forward their candidacy must do so on the 29th between 8:30am and 5:00pm, which will be accepted at the Central Soja General Welfare Centre.
Voting will take place on from 7am to 6pm on October 6th at 35 locations round the city, and counting of the ballots will begin at 7:30am on the same day at the welfare centre.
Prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India
India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.
Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal.
If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.
Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.
Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall.
Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.
The monsoon was also late to arrive.
Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.
The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year.
"It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food.
Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).
Festivals are also at risk.
The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.
Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil.
But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.
[Sendai] Will beat tough rival Yokohama M with compact defense Manager Watanabe feeling confident at closed training (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
J1 Vegalta Sendai held a 4-day closed training (open to press for the first 20 minutes) from the 24th to gear up for their home match against Yokohama M on 28th.
Although they lost a total of 15 points to Yokohama M in the 3 latest league matches, Manager Watanabe Susumu (45) said that he felt "the players showed me powerful, competitive training."
During last season, 8 points were lost in a home match (July 18th) which is the club's worst record, and another 5 points lost at an away match.
The tough opponent is one that caused a loss at 1-2 on away grounds this season.
As opposed to Sendai that is currently in 14th, Yokohama M, currently 3rd, has made 48 points so far, which is a tie for the first place in the league.
Along with the powerful front line players such as FW Marcos Junior (26), who scored 13 points, and FW Nakagawa Teruhito (27) who scored 10 points and assisted 7, one of the best CB combination in J league, Japan National DF Hatanaka Shinnosuke (24) and fleet-footed Brazilian DF Thiago Martins will be playing.
Manager Watanabe said, "We have variations in our aggressive play and speedy CB, and we will keep a compact defense while play confidently without showing any weaknesses."
Losing to J2 Nagasaki on the 18th at the Emperor’s cup that they were hoping to win for the first time, they have only 8 league matches left.
The director said, "It was a tough defeat, but what's important right now is getting back up and keep on going."
They will keep themselves motivated and show what they have practiced on the pitch.

Heavy exposure to pesticides may boost risk of heart disease, stroke
Working around high levels of pesticides may translate into a high risk for heart trouble later, a new study suggests.
That was the case for a group of Japanese-American men in Hawaii who were followed for more than three decades.
Compared to men who had not worked around pesticides, those who had the greatest exposure had a 45 percent higher risk for heart disease or stroke, researchers found.
"This study emphasizes the importance of using personal protective equipment during exposure to pesticides on the job and the importance of documenting occupational exposure to pesticides in medical records, as well as controlling standard heart disease risk factors," said study co-author Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
The findings stem from data on more than 6,000 men on Oahu who took part in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Because only men of Japanese descent were involved, the findings may not apply to women or other populations, the researchers noted.
Since pesticides have a long half-life, their effects on health may show up years after exposure.
In this case, the greatest effects were seen within 10 years of exposure.
"After following the men for 34 years, the link between being exposed to pesticides at work and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant," Rodriguez said in a news release.
This was probably because other factors tied to aging became more important, masking the possible relation of pesticides and cardiovascular disease later in life.
Researchers found no significant link between exposure to low to moderate amounts of pesticides and the risk of heart disease or stroke.
The Zelensky-Trump phone call: Poroshenko weighs in
It was an explosive week in Washington politics, with impeachment proceedings launched against US President Donald Trump.
For political novice Volodymyr Zelensky, being swept up into a political scandal is a move he would have wanted to avoid.
But what do we know so far about the Zelensky-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the former?
Quite early on in the phone call, Trump tells Zelensky that the US is doing more for Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the calls notes released by the White House is not verbatim, it details Trump taking a hit at German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that the German leader and other European counterparts engage in talks rather than concrete proposals.
It was Zelensky's response that has been seen as controversial, saying that he does not agree with Trump 100%, rather 1000%.
Zelensky added that both the French President Macron and Merkel are not working enough to assist Ukraine.
This exchange had politicians, particularly from the opposition within Ukraine, talking on social media.
Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president, took to Twitter to say that the support provided by the EU "has been unprecedented."
In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU support provided during "Russian aggression," which included sanctions and economic aid.
Others expressed their concern, with Ukranian politician Victoria Voytsiska saying: "How could we speak to Germany and France again?"
Trump goes on to allude to military aid and asks Zelensky to investigate not one, but two claims: one into Joe Biden's son Hunter but also into the hacked DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine had some involvement in hacking into the Democrat's emails during the 2016 election.
Whether this will hinder European relations, or burn bridges with his French and German counterparts, is unclear.
I don't want to say anything bad about anyone ...
"We thank everyone who helps us," Zelensky said in New York at the UN General Assembly following the release of the phone transcript.
Zelensky is set to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany, and France in the upcoming Normandy Four summit in October.
Ghana Wins Two ICAO Awards
Ghana has won two prestigious awards at the ongoing 40th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was in recognition of Ghana obtaining Africa's highest score in Aviation Safety Oversight after scoring a provisional Effective Implementation (EI) rate of 89.89 percent.
This was after ICAO concluded its Coordinated Validation Mission (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, in line with the United Nations Aviation Agency's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme.
The award for security was in recognition of the country's high commitment to the ICAO's recommended standards and protocols on security at the Airport and Ghana's airspace.
The awards scheme was established in support of the ICAO's No Country Left Behind initiative.
Additionally, 16 other certificates were awarded for safety and 17 certificates awarded for security to member states of ICAO who had improved upon their safety and security standards.
Present to receive the awards for Ghana was the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda; Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey; Ghana's Ambassador to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and the Managing Director of the Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President for the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, in his address stressed the need for member states to maintain safety in the aviation space.
He said "it is important for us to continue to remind ourselves that even in the era of innovation, Aviation safety, security and sustainability must remain our most fundamental priorities ."
On his part, Mr Adda remarked that the awards were great achievement to the country's efforts, as it would complement the sector's hard work and perseverance.
He further noted that the aviation sector held great potential to developing the country's economy, saying "aviation holds a lot to transform our lives.
The socioeconomic benefits are there but all comes from the safety and security which we've been able to achieve.

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor to be FEMA chief: White House
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor smiles as he testifies before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on FEMA's FY2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.
Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post.
Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.
Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected.
He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.
Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.
Police Shut Down Illegal Marijuana Vaping Operating In San Gabriel Valley - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police shut down an illegal marijuana vaping operation in the San Gabriel Valley Thursday.
The bust happened at about 4:37 p.m. after police conducting a warrant search for suspected illegal marijuana vape pen sales and found large jars of butane honey oil - concentrated cannabis oil - at an office building in the 9600 block of Telstar Avenue.
Lt. Christopher Cano with the El Monte Police said officers also found a machine that was used to load vape cartridges.
"The process is very dangerous," Cano said.
Cano, who used to work narcotics, said the process of distilling the oil for use in vape products is potentially flammable.
"Simple static electricity from our clothes can ignite these fumes causing not just a fire, but an explosion because it's under concentration," he said.
And if there's multiple jars and things like that, we're going to have one explosion after the next causing not just a fire, but we could possibly have a full complex taken out with the explosion.
A hazmat team was called to the vacant office to take possession of the illegal and potentially dangerous substance.
The value of the confiscated products and equipment was not immediately known.
Detectives said they received an anonymous tip that led to the search warrant where they discovered the illegal operation.
Investigators are still trying to figure out who's behind the illegal vaping operation.
They said they believe the person responsible set up shop in the office because the space was vacant.
While the investigation continues, officers said they wanted to make sure the illegal vaping products did not make it to the street, especially in the wake of recent headlines involving the dangers of vaping.
"This is just stuff that they don't even know if they're truly getting what they think that they're buying," Cano said.
This could be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
It could be very harmful to our community, to our children, so we always caution them that they should stay away from these operations.
Seismic intensity 6 earthquake hits during a concert!
Earthquake drill conducted at auditorium in Miyazaki city (Miyazaki News UMK) - Yahoo! News
A practical evacuation drill was conducted at an auditorium simulating an earthquake during a concert.
This drill is held annually.
An actual concert was being performed by the Miyazaki fire department on the stage, with the scenario of a seismic intensity 6 earthquake hitting during a piece.
300 people participated in the drill held on 27th, including kindergarteners, local residents, and the employees at the auditorium.
While the kindergarteners are enjoying the concert...
(Announcement in the auditorium)
"Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake in progress, please lower your body and stay still where you are"
Afterward, the participants evacuated to the entrance with the assumption a fire started.
Earthquake, an uncertain occurrence regardless of time or place.
The participants reinstated awareness about disaster prevention through this drill.
Elizabeth I's lost dress to go on display at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest chamblet silk, woven with strips of beaten silver, and had been exquisitely embroidered in a rich pattern of plants, beasts and butterflies.
To Eleri Lynn, curator of the dress collection at Historic Royal Palaces, that meant only one thing.
The faded piece of fabric she was looking at, hanging on the wall of a tiny rural parish church where it had been placed 100 years earlier, could only be a lost piece of clothing from the wardrobe of Elizabeth I.
Three years after Lynn stumbled across the sumptuous fabric, which had been used as an altar cloth in the church in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress is to go on display next month at Hampton Court palace, close to the very rooms where the Tudor queen may well have worn it more than 450 years ago.
It is a measure of the importance of the discovery that in the entire royal dress collection, only one other item of 16th-century dress survives.
And while there is no cast iron proof that the dress was once worn by Elizabeth, three years of scholarship have only strengthened experts' conviction that the dress must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Cloth of silver," a fantastically expensive fabric, was by law reserved only for the most senior members of the royal household, while the "virtuoso" quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later supplemented by stags and dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear, also points to the loftiest of previous owners.
The gown, at the time it was made, would have cost the equivalent of a Tudor mansion.
In addition, said Lynn, in the 1590s, late in Elizabeth's reign, she had grown threatened by other women at court and would not have tolerated rivals wearing such exquisite fabric.
It's a big thing to say, so I have had lots of peer reviewers come and have a look at it.
And it has always been really gratifying that when they see it they have a "wow" moment too, and leave quite convinced that we are looking at an item of royal dress."
The long second life of the dress panel, recut to serve as an altar cloth in the obscure church of St Faith's, Bacton, is not quite so unexpected as it might appear.
Bacton was the home hamlet of Blanche Parry, the closest of Elizabeth's maids of honour who served the queen throughout her long life, and local legend has long associated the textile with Parry.
Though the dress postdates her death in 1590, experts believe Elizabeth must have given it to the Parry family or the parish in Blanche's memory, before her own death in 1603.
After more than 1,000 hours of conservation, 400 of them spent in the most delicate handstitching using specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, the altar cloth will go on display next to the "Rainbow portrait," one of the most celebrated contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, which shows her dressed in a similar gown and which has been loaned by Hatfield House for the duration of the exhibition.
"When you're working with historic textiles you gain a real respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made them," said Libby Thompson, who led the conservation, much of which took place in a converted greenhouse in the Hampton Court grounds - the only space large enough to house some of the palace's priceless tapestries.
Looking at the embroidery, on the front and the back, it's given me a massive respect for those who made it.
I have never worked on anything that's quite so elite.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth opens on 12 October at Hampton Court Palace

One Vote Disparity Litigation 1st Oral Proceedings - Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
In a trial where voters are seeking invalidation of the election to the House of Councilors that was carried out in July, claiming it was a violation of the Constitution without correcting the disparity of one vote, the first oral proceedings took place at the Miyazaki Branch of the Fukuoka High Court, and the trial was concluded the same day.
According to the complaint, the plaintiffs point out that compared to Fukui, where there is the least number of voters per member of Upper House in the election this July, the value of one vote in Miyazaki is 0.71, and only 0.48 in Kagoshima, and due to this the election is invalid.
At the first oral proceedings held on the 27th at the Miyazaki Branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff asserted that “the value of one vote per person was unequal and unconstitutional”
The defendant, the Prefectural Election Commission, stated It was “not a significant enough inequality to be considered unfair, so it should be considered constitutional." And requested the claim to be dismissed.
The ruling will be announced on October 30th.

Isuzu heavy-duty truck, Giga, world premier of the latest model ...Tokyo motor show 2019 (Response) - Yahoo! News
Isuzu motors will showcase their latest model heavy-duty truck "Giga" for the first time in the world at "Tokyo motor show 2019," which will be held at venues including Tokyo Big Sight from October 24th to November 4th.
In addition to the latest advanced safety feature, Isuzu's flagship model, Giga, has improved features to reduce driver fatigue.
It will contribute to better safety with its pre-crash brake that detects pedestrians and bicycles, blind spot monitor to help avoid collisions when turning at intersections as well as assist safe lane changes and adaptive LED headlights with variable light distribution,
Cruise control system utilizing a millimeter-wave radar to automatically adjust the vehicle speed for a safe distance from a preceding vehicle and a newly designed high roof cabin are also added to alleviate driver fatigue.
Additionally, a vehicle operation / movement management system "Mimamori" improves the condition of the vehicle.
It monitors the status of the safety features, and support safe operation of the vehicle.
Also, there will be a world premiere of "FL-IR", a logistic network of the future depicted by a show model.
FL-IR focuses on similarities between connected and platooning trucks and marine animals' communication through ultrasonic waves and their unique behaviors.
The exterior has "shark" inspired bio design that projects an image of an effective robot, with characteristic of contrasting styles between organically shaped sharp-nose cabin for cutting through the wind, and the sturdy aero device that surrounds it.
A layer design was applied for the interior, which enables the dashboard to switch between manual or autonomous driving.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)'s unmanned robotic cargo spacecraft, Kounotori 8, on a mission to bring supplies the International Space Station orbiting above Earth at an altitude of 400km, reached the vicinity of the station on the evening of the 28th, where it was caught by a robot arm being operated by one of the astronauts onboard.
The supply craft was launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture on the 25th, gradually climbing to the required altitude under the control of the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, it matched speed with the station, getting to a distance within just 10m of the station.
From there, the supply craft was grabbed by a 17.6m-long robotic arm.
It was carrying approximately 5.3 tons of supplies.
Once it was docked with the station, the astronauts brought the supplies on board.
Mexican cartel boss behind one-third of drugs in the U.S.
Chicago - Just after sunrise on Chicago's West Side, CBS News watched the morning rush for drugs.
Brian McKnight with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) showed what was going on in broad daylight.
Last year in Chicago, almost 800 people died from drug overdoses.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago are coming from Mexico.
The DEA is focused on a Mexican drug lord named Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"He is the number one priority for DEA and frankly for federal law enforcement in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's top agent in Mexico.
A bounty for El Mencho is up to $10 million.
He has helped uncover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
El Mencho's Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of the drugs entering the U.S. by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has trafficked "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl-laced heroin.
El Mencho has a $10 million bounty on his head.
Ironically, he lived in California some 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported back to Mexico.
That's where he started the violent cartel.
He has got an enormous amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.
He basically has his own SWAT teams," Donahue said.
From shooting down a Mexican Army helicopter, killing six, to being implicated in a public hanging this summer, El Mencho protects his empire with impunity.
Cartel violence has led to thousands of murders in recent years.
According to statistics from the Mexican government, there are approximately 94 homicides per day.
Back in Chicago, the Mexican drugs seized are so toxic, they can't be handled without protective gear.
At the lab, packs of cocaine are stamped with trafficker brands.
More than a third can be traced back to El Mencho's cartel.
"He is the one that is responsible for sending the poison that is actually killing innocent women and kids," Donahue said.
So, when someone's child dies, Donahue said there's "a good chance" those drugs came from El Mencho's organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from an overdose.
Osaka Tennoji Zoo bids farewell to koala as he will be lent to the UK for 10 years as part of a breeding program | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
"Ark" the male koala will be lent to a zoo in the UK for breeding, at Tennoji Zoo in Osaka on the 28th
Children writing messages to "Ark" at farewell party for the koala, at Tennoji Zoo in Osaka on the 28th
On the 28th, Tennoji Zoo (Tennoji-ku, Osaka) held a farewell party for its male koala, Ark, the only male koala in Osaka prefecture.
Setting out in mid-October, Ark will spend the next 10 years on loan at a zoo in England to participate in its breeding program, and it is unlikely that he will ever return.
"Thank you", "Take care".
Approximately 600 visitors gathered in front of the eucalyptus-filled koala building for an emotional farewell.
Ark is 12 years old.
Koalas live for 15-20 years in captivity, and Ark is expected to live out the rest of his natural life with his new family in England.
Ark's keeper Tsujimoto Hideki said tearfully, "It's sad to be no longer rearing koalas. I'm so grateful for what I had."
PS4 game goes old-school, as Sony reveals surprise PlayStation 4 news
Sony has shed more light on upcoming PS4 exclusive The Last of Us: Part Two.
As part of Sony's recent State of Play presentation, Sony announced a February 2020 release date for the Last of Us sequel.
Fans were also treated to some breathtaking new gameplay footage of the upcoming action game.
Even more details have been announced in the days since the big Last of Us 2 gameplay reveal.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are taking it back to the old-school in more ways than one.
Something we haven't seen very often since the PSOne era, The Last of Us: Part 2 will ship on multiple discs.
Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann confirmed as much in an excellent interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"This story is ambitious and complex in ways that the first one wasn't," he said.
And it needed to be that big to tell this kind of story with this many characters.
We didn't set out to make the biggest game ever, it just kind of evolved that way.
"We got excited by how much this story has to offer, and there's going to be moments where you'll think you're getting to the end and you'll realise it was just the opening part and it's opened up to this whole other section," Druckmann continues.
It's so ambitious the game doesn't fit on one BluRay, it's on two discs.
Elsewhere, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two not safe for work Easter eggs (via Gamespot).
While we won't ruin the surprise here, the in-game Easter eggs include references to old-school Naughty Dog releases.
You can find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two launches exclusively for PS4 on February 21, 2020.
PS4 owners can prepare for the release of the sequel by picking up The Last of Us Remastered with PS Plus.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 games for October 2019, which includes the aforementioned Naughty Dog release.
MLB The Show 19 will also be available for PS Plus subscribers in October.
If you enjoy The Last of Us Remastered and want to pre-order the sequel, Sony has announced multiple editions of the game, including a bumper version containing a replica of Ellie's backpack, her bracelet and a 12-inch statue of the iconic character.
Mobile sales on Noto-jima "a big help", residents hope council continues trials (The Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
On the 26th, on Nanao city's island of Noto-jima, where the population is ageing and the number of shops is on the decline, the Noto-jima Community Development Council that is made up of residents began trial of mobile sales.
The trial will continue until December, and on the first day station wagons loaded with daily necessities, condiments and seasonings and other food products visited Suso Town Council and Hannoura Town Council.
Some products sold a lot more quickly than expected and had to be quickly replenished, while residents said it was "a big help", "picking out products was fun" and they hoped the service would continue.
The station wagons were loaded with 110 products, including prepared side dishes, city designated rubbish bags and detergent.
To make it easier for elderly people living alone to eat, side dishes such as potato salad and fried strips of burdock were available in smaller packs at the reasonable price of 100 yen.
At Suso Town Council, residents queued up to purchase items, and the salt and sugar sold out.
Kikuchi Akinobu of the development council expressed their surprise, saying, "I didn't think things would sell as well as they did."
Harada Mitsue (83) of Suso-cho, who would usually be driven to the shops by her husband, said, "The prices are cheap and it's convenient. I don't know how much longer my husband will be able to drive for, so I'd definitely like this service to continue."
Other shoppers had particular requests, one asking for them to bring drip coffee rather than canned coffee.
The council will consider a selection of products that suits everyone's needs.
Noto-jima currently only has one convenience store where you buy daily necessities, so the development council has set up the mobile sales trial to help people who find it difficult to go out shopping.
The service will visit the island's 20 town councils once a month until December, after which, they will consider whether it can continue as a normal service in the new year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced almost $100 million of extra assistance for drought-affected communities.
A program delivering cash payments to drought-affected farmers will be extended, and the farm household allowance will be overhauled to make it simpler.
The package includes almost $34 million for the Drought Community Support Initiative allowing eligible households access to up to $3000 in emergency payments.
Up to 13 local government areas will each be provided with up to $1 million in infrastructure and drought relief grants under the Drought Community Programme.
The new support package comes on top of more than $7 billion in drought support funding already provided by the government.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man convicted of killing his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted in the 2014 killings of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
Authorities said he entered the Stays' home on July 9, 2014, demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, Melannie Haskell.
She was not there, but her sister, Katie Stay, and her family were.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys, ages 13 and 4, and two girls, ages 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.
Only one member of the family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
Authorities at the time indicated she was critically wounded, though she later made a full recovery.
Jurors on Thursday unanimously rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's insanity defense.
The jury was dismissed until Monday for sentencing.
"If you choose to fail us, you will not be forgiven"
Did the condemnation of a girl, whose voice quivered with anger, resonate with the amassed world leaders?
Global warming increases in severity.
Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old environmental activist from Sweden, addressed the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, calling for stronger measures.
By boycotting classes and sitting in front of parliament, she has helped to spark "school strikes" around the world.
Anxious and frustrated young people took part in protests en masse around the world, including in Japan.
It is estimated that around 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
There were even people marching with placards in Morioka.
The threat of climate change draws ever closer.
The Paris Agreement, which will come fully into effect in 2020, is an international framework that aims to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases to essentially zero by the latter half of the century, and to keep temperature rise since the Industrial Revolution within 2属C, preferably 1.5属C.
All participating nations will do their part to implement the necessary measures regardless of whether they are a developed or developing nation.
Yet, abnormal weather patterns that have been linked to global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rain, continue to affect various areas.
Further efforts are required to combat the rapid pace of global warming.
At the summit, which was called into session by UN Secretary-General Guterres to emphasize the impending crisis, 77 nations announced long-term targets to cut emissions to zero by 2050.
A further 70 nations have increased their immediate targets.
Meanwhile, the US, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, as well as China and India, have not set any new targets, highlighting the slowness of action on the part of major polluters.
Criticism towards Japan for sticking to coal-fired power generation is also persistent.
The government's long-term strategy does set forth the intention to reach zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but this falls far short of the countries aiming to get to zero by 2050.
Japan also did not have the opportunity to speak at the summit.
Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro, who has been presenting on Japan's efforts at a meeting on the environment, said at a news conference on climate change issues, "tackling this should be fun, cool, and sexy."
One cannot deny his persuasiveness, but it somewhat pales in comparison with the words spoken by the young women.
Opposition towards Greta, who has now become a symbol of environmental action, also continues.
Baseless criticism would be nothing but sidestepping the very issue Thunberg is arguing for.
There can be no more delaying measures to counteract global warming, and the international community must move as one to tackle a crisis that will affect everyone on the planet.
If any one country is not steadfast in its commitments, sufficient results cannot be expected.
There are many young people and children behind Greta.
Adults must act so as not to take away their future.
Quantum internet closer to reality -- ScienceDaily
A U.S. Army research result brings the quantum internet a step closer.
Such an internet could offer the military security, sensing and timekeeping capabilities not possible with traditional networking approaches.
The U.S. Army's Combat Capability Development's Army Research Laboratory's Center for Distributed Quantum Information, funded and managed by the lab's Army Research Office, saw researchers at the University of Innsbruck achieve a record for the transfer of quantum entanglement between matter and light -- a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.
Entanglement is a correlation that can be created between quantum entities such as qubits.
When two qubits are entangled and a measurement is made on one, it will affect the outcome of a measurement made on the other, even if that second qubit is physically far away.
"This [50 kilometers] is two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and is a practical distance to start building inter-city quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at University of Innsbruck and the principal investigator for the project, whose findings are published in the Nature journal Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would be composed of distant network nodes of physical qubits, which are, despite the large physical separation, nevertheless entangled.
This distribution of entanglement is essential for establishing a quantum internet, researchers said.
"The demonstration is a major step forward for achieving large scale distributed entanglement," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-manager of the Army program supporting the research.
The quality of the entanglement after traveling through fiber is also high enough at the other end to meet some of the requirements for some of the most difficult quantum networking applications.
The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, the researchers wrote a quantum state onto the ion and simultaneously excited it to emit a photon in which quantum information is stored.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the light particle were entangled.
The challenge is to transmit the photon over fiber optic cables.
"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the optical fiber," Lanyon said.
His team therefore initially sent the light particle through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser.
The photon wavelength was converted to the optimal value for long-distance travel -- the current telecommunications standard wavelength of 1,550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through the 50-kilometer-long optical fiber line.
Their measurements show that atom and light particles were still entangled even after the wavelength conversion and the distance traveled.
"The choice to use calcium means these results also provide a direct path to realizing an entangled network of atomic clocks over a large physical distance, since calcium can be co-trapped with a high quality "clock" qubit.
Large scale entangled clock networks are of great interest to the Army for precision position, navigation, and timing applications," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, an Army researcher who also co-manages the program.
