Rewriting the Monetary-Policy Script
MUNICH – How long will major central banks blindly rely on rigid rules to control inflation and stimulate growth?
Given the clear benefits of nimble monetary policy, central bankers need to open their eyes to the possibilities that flexibility affords.
The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment.
This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand.
When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models.
But in too many cases, those scripts have led us astray, because they assume that monetary policy has a measurable and foreseeable impact on demand and inflation.
There is plenty of reason to question this assumption.
For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more.
If savings no longer yield a return, people can’t afford big-ticket items or pay for retirement down the road.
Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more.
It’s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers. The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated.
This requires pushing interest rates as low as possible, and when these policies have run their course (such as when rates dip toward the negative), unconventional instruments like “quantitative easing” must be deployed to revive growth and inflation.
The paradigm has become so universally accepted – and the model simulations underpinning central banks’ decisions have become so complex – that few are willing to question it.
For individual central banks or economists, to do so would be sacrilege.
Central banks do not completely deny the economic costs that these policies imply: exuberance in financial markets, financing gaps in funded pension systems, and deeper wealth inequality, to name just a few.
But these costs are deemed an acceptable price to pay to reach the clearly defined inflation level.
Yet the policies pursued in recent years have given no room for the intangibles – unstable political environments, geopolitical tremors, or rising risks on financial markets – that can send models off course.
As the 2008 financial crisis illustrated, the normal distribution of risk was useless for predictions.
Keynes never tired of arguing that monetary policy becomes ineffective if uncertainty is sufficient to destabilize the expectations of consumers and investors.
Bangladesh’s Deadly War on Drugs
LONDON – The audio quality is poor and the sound of gunshots muffled, but the agony in Ekramul Haque’s voice is unmistakable. On May 26, while speaking with his family by phone, Haque, an elected official in southern Bangladesh, was gunned down by police in an apparent extrajudicial killing.
Bangladeshi authorities insist Haque was a drug dealer who died in an exchange of gunfire, but the audio evidence – captured by his wife as she listened to her husband die – suggests that the officers involved killed him and then planted drugs at the scene.
The recording casts a disturbing light on Bangladesh’s new drug-control strategy.
Since May, when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina revamped her government’s war on drugs, an estimated 25,000 people have been arbitrarily imprisoned, and at least 200 have died in alleged shootouts.
The parallels to President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal drug crackdown in the Philippines are chilling.
There, human rights are routinely violated and more than 20,000 people have been slaughtered since 2016.
While Duterte’s campaign has drawn international condemnation, Hasina’s purge has been subject to less scrutiny.
The relative lack of international criticism seems to have emboldened the government to act even more ruthlessly.
While the death penalty for drugs has existed in Bangladesh for decades, it has rarely been used.
This could change dramatically if Parliament approves the government’s bill.
The ferocity of the authorities’ anti-drug campaign, together with the extremely low threshold for yaba possession, means that even people who use drugs and low-level dealers could face execution.
Despite what governments claim, the death penalty for drug offenses does not target kingpins.
It is the poor and the most vulnerable who suffer.
This would certainly be the case in Bangladesh, where some Rohingya refugees – who have fled horrific persecution in neighboring Myanmar – rely on the drug trade for economic survival.
Moreover, there is simply no evidence that the death penalty for drug use lowers rates of consumption or trafficking.
Almost 4,000 people have been executed for drug offenses in the past decade, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime admits that the drug market is still booming.
Death penalty laws are little more than grotesque grandstanding by governments seeking to appear “tough” on drugs while blindly ignoring the facts.
The Business Side of Brexit
The decline in the pound’s value may also start to hurt households.
Consumer price inflation is set to peak at close to 3% this year.
Yet, given the changing dynamics of the labor market and subdued productivity growth, average wage gains are not likely to be much more than 2.5%.
In real terms, therefore, average household incomes are likely to remain flat or even shrink, undermining the UK economy’s crucial consumer-spending engine.
Worse, these impending macroeconomic challenges may well be dwarfed by those arising from the coming Brexit negotiations, though perhaps not for the reason one might expect.
The key danger for businesses, as the leader of a construction-engineering firm put it to me, is that planning for all of the possible Brexit scenarios can become an all-consuming affair, causing companies to lose sight of their larger strategic goals.
The good news is that, so far, the business community seems confident.
Entrepreneurs and CEOs have plenty of experience making decisions in an uncertain world.
So, despite the Brexit unknowns, they are continuing to invest in future-oriented areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics.
The truth is that it is the technological revolution and the surge in consumption in Asia – not the UK’s relationship with the EU – that will transform the way business is done over the next couple of decades.
Brexit In Reverse?
LONDON – Economic reality is beginning to catch up with the false hopes of many Britons.
One year ago, when a slim majority voted for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, they believed the promises of the popular press, and of the politicians who backed the Leave campaign, that Brexit would not reduce their living standards.
Indeed, in the year since, they have managed to maintain those standards by running up household debt.
This worked for a while, because the increase in household consumption stimulated the economy.
But the moment of truth for the UK economy is fast approaching.
As the latest figures published by the Bank of England show, wage growth in Britain is not keeping up with inflation, so real incomes have begun to fall.
As this trend continues in the coming months, households will soon realize that their living standards are falling, and they will have to adjust their spending habits.
To make matters worse, they will also realize that they have become over-indebted and will have to deleverage, thus further reducing the household consumption that has sustained the economy.
Moreover, the BoE has made the same mistake as the average household: it underestimated the impact of inflation and will now be catching up by raising interest rates in a pro-cyclical manner.
These higher rates will make household debt even harder to pay off.
The British are fast approaching the tipping point that characterizes all unsustainable economic trends.
I refer to such a tipping point as “reflexivity” – when both cause and effect shape each other.
Economic reality is reinforced by political reality.
The fact is that Brexit is a lose-lose proposition, harmful both to Britain and the EU.
The Brexit referendum cannot be undone, but people can change their minds.
Apparently, this is happening.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s attempt to strengthen her negotiating position by holding a snap election badly misfired: she lost her parliamentary majority and created a hung parliament (no single party has a majority).
The primary cause of May’s defeat was her fatal misstep in proposing that elderly people pay for a substantial portion of their social care out of their own resources, usually the value of the homes that they have lived in all of their lives.
This “dementia tax,” as it became widely known, deeply offended the core constituency, the elderly, of May’s Conservative Party.
VATICAN CITY – The scourge of human trafficking is an issue that leaders of all faiths must take very seriously.
One of the first things that Pope Francis did when he was elected in March 2013 was to write to me, in my capacity as head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (PAS), requesting that we study modern slavery and its solutions.
Nine months later, Francis convened religious leaders from around the world to declare that trafficking humans and their organs, and forced labor and prostitution, are crimes against humanity.
In September 2015, world leaders echoed this conclusion when the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals – which include a target to end these practices.
For these and many other reasons, it is a moral imperative that the world work together to achieve the vision set by our religious and political leaders.
With millions of people still victimized by modern forms of involuntary servitude, there is no time to waste.
Abuse in all of its forms – whether torture, rape, forced marriage, or forced labor – does more than cause physical damage.
It strikes at a person’s soul, leaving wounds to our self-confidence and ability to trust others that can be even more painful and profound.
To grasp fully the depravity of this type of “moral violence,” think of friends who love, approve, and affirm one another, and how important those actions are to their individual and collective existence.
Victims of human trafficking cannot experience this type of friendship easily, because the degradation and humiliation they have suffered can lead them to believe they are unimportant or someone else’s property.
As a result, they are often unable to offer or receive the support and affirmation that true friendship requires.
These disabilities extend to victims’ participation in marriage and family.
Christ’s message of fraternity, coupled with the anti-slavery movement that began at the end of the eighteenth century, eventually led to the abolition of legal human bondage around the world.
International treaties – like the Slavery Convention of 1926 – made many forms of slavery illegal.
However, slavery continues under new names, stirring less public outrage or attention than past violations of civil liberties.
While human rights became a defining feature of the post-World War II era, victims of modern slavery still suffer.
Negative feelings can be helpful in efforts to prevent social exclusion.
Indignation might disarm us, but it could also mobilize us to take action.
When people observe the intolerable contrast between what is expected in terms of human rights and what victims of modern slavery actually endure, it becomes harder to ignore the unfair distribution of dignity in our societies.
China’s Irresistible Rise
LONDON – China’s recently released GDP data for 2017 confirm it: the country’s dramatic rise, with the concomitant increase in its global economic relevance, is not slowing down.
To be sure, there has been fresh media chatter about the reliability of Chinese data, owing to reports that some provinces have been overestimating their economic performance in recent years.
But for all we know, other provinces may have been doing the opposite.
And in any case, the provinces that have admitted to inflating their data are not large enough to have a significant impact on the national picture.
Moreover, two key points are often lost in the debate about China’s official statistics, which the country first starting releasing in the late 1990s.
First, the debate is relevant only if China is increasing the degree to which it overestimates its data.
Second, China’s published data should be considered in the context of its trading partners’ own figures, as well as those of major international companies that do business in China.
As I have written before, it is telling that China has overtaken both France and the United States to become Germany’s top trading partner.
As for the annualized 2017 data, most of the media focus has been on China’s reported real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth, which, at 6.9%, represents the first acceleration in a couple of years and an improvement even on the government’s soft target rate of 6.5%.
But the more important figure is China’s nominal GDP growth translated into US dollars.
Owing partly to a strengthening renminbi, China’s total economic output grew to $12.7 trillion in 2017, representing a massive increase of 13% ($1.5 trillion) in just 12 months.
Clearly, those who have warned that China is following in Japan’s footsteps and heading for a long-term deflationary cycle have been far off the mark.
To my mind, such simplistic comparisons are never particularly useful.
Not only has China averted the risk of deflation; it has done so with an appreciating currency.
When my former Goldman Sachs colleagues and I first started tracking the rise of the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) in the early 2000s, we figured that it would take until the end of 2015 just for China to catch up to Japan.
Yet 2018 has barely started, and already China’s economy is two-and-a-half times larger than Japan’s, five times larger than India’s, six times larger than Brazil’s, and eight times larger than Russia’s.
It is also larger than the entire eurozone.
China’s staggering $1.5 trillion expansion in 2017 means that, in nominal terms, it essentially created a new economy the size of South Korea, twice the size of Switzerland, and three times the size of Sweden.
The latest data suggest that China could catch up to the US, in nominal terms, sometime around 2027, if not before.
What China Can Teach America About Clean Air
NORTHAMPTON – Every year, more than four million people around the world die prematurely from breathing dirty air.
In China alone, the number of deaths attributable to air pollution exceeds one million annually.
That figure may not come as a surprise; after all, we are routinely treated to images in the media of thick, sooty smog enveloping Beijing, Shanghai, and other Chinese cities.
But America’s air kills, too – and it is getting a lot less attention.
A 2013 MIT study estimated that poor air quality accounts for 200,000 early deaths in the United States each year, more than the number killed by car crashes and diabetes (other studies have put the number lower, closer to 100,000).
Yet, while China today is aggressively tackling its air pollution problem, the US is rolling back air-quality protections in the name of economic growth – an ill-conceived strategy that will have a devastating impact on human health.
Ever since the publication of Harvard’s “Six Cities” study in 1993, scientists and public-health officials have been aware of the links between mortality and fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 (airborne particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns).
When people inhale PM2.5, microscopic solids and liquid droplets of dust, dirt, organic chemicals, and metals can travel deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.
Research over the past 20 years has tied PM2.5 to a range of adverse health outcomes, including asthma, acute bronchitis, lung cancer, heart attacks, and cardiorespiratory diseases.
We know, too, where most PM2.5 comes from: power plants, heavy industry, and motor vehicles.
During fossil-fuel combustion, carbon dioxide, the world’s most prevalent greenhouse gas, is emitted into the air, along with particles of incompletely combusted solids and gases (mainly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) that react chemically in the atmosphere to form fine particulate matter.
Knowing the killer pollutant and its sources, the US Environmental Protection Agency, under the 1990 Clean Air Act, issued new standards to reduce PM2.5 levels.
The EPA estimates that between 1990 and 2015, the national concentration of particulate matter fell by 37%, and that in 2010, some 160,000 premature deaths were averted as a result of the regulations.
In short, despite a considerable number of deaths still linked to dirty air, the US had, until this year, been heading in the right direction.
Now, however, US President Donald Trump has promised to create “unbelievable prosperity” by discarding regulations intended to reduce toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants, lowering or eliminating fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, and dismantling the EPA.
He has also vowed to repeal limits on fracking, open up more public lands to coal mining, and expand oil and gas production in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.
Let’s assume, for a moment, that such measures would actually produce prosperity for the entire country, and not just for the fossil-fuel industry.
What price, as a country, is the US willing to pay?
How many early deaths per year are too many?
SHANGHAI – China has firmly established itself as a global leader in consumer-oriented digital technologies.
It is the world’s largest e-commerce market, accounting for more than 40% of global transactions, and ranks among the top three countries for venture capital investment in autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, robotics, drones, and artificial intelligence (AI).
One in three of the world’s unicorns (start-ups valued at more than $1 billion) is Chinese, and the country’s cloud providers hold the world record for computing efficiency.
While China runs a trade deficit in services overall, it has lately been running a trade surplus in digital services of up to $15 billion per year.
Powering China’s impressive progress in the digital economy are Internet giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, which are commercializing their services on a massive scale, and bringing new business models to the world.
Together, these three companies have 500-900 million active monthly users in their respective sectors. Their rise has been facilitated by light – or, perhaps more accurate, late – regulation.
For example, regulators put a cap on the value of online money transfers a full 11 years after Alipay introduced the service.
Now, these Internet firms are using their positions to invest in China’s digital ecosystem – and in the emerging cadre of tenacious entrepreneurs that increasingly define it.
Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent together fund 30% of China’s top start-ups, such as Didi Chuxing ($50 billion), Meituan-Dianping ($30 billion), and JD.com ($56 billion).
With the world’s largest domestic market and plentiful venture capital, China’s old “copy-cat” entrepreneurs have transformed themselves into innovation powerhouses.
They fought like gladiators in the world’s most competitive market, learned to develop sophisticated business models (such as Taobao’s freemium model), and built impregnable moats to protect their businesses (for example, Meituan-Dianping created an end-to-end food app, including delivery).
As a result, the valuation of Chinese innovators is many times higher than that of their Western counterparts.
Moreover, China leads the world in some sectors, from livestreaming (one example is Musical.ly, a lip-syncing and video-sharing app) to bicycle sharing (Mobike and Ofo exceed 50 million rides per day in China, and are now expanding abroad).
Most important, China is at the frontier of mobile payments, with more than 600 million Chinese mobile users able to conduct peer-to-peer transactions with nearly no fees.
China’s mobile-payment infrastructure – which already handles far more transactions than the third-party mobile-payment market in the United States – will become a platform for many more innovations.
As Chinese firms become increasingly technically capable, the country’s market advantage is turning into a data advantage – critical to support the development of AI.
The Chinese firm Face++ recently raised $460 million, the largest amount ever for an AI company.
DJI (a $14 billion consumer drone company), iFlyTek (a $14 billion voice recognition company), and Hikvision (a $50 billion video-surveillance company) are the world’s most valuable firms in their respective domains.
Another important developing trend in China is “online merging with offline” (OMO) – a trend that, along with AI, Sinovation Ventures is betting on.
Deciphering China’s Economic Resilience
NEW HAVEN – Once again, the Chinese economy has defied the hand wringing of the nattering nabobs of negativism.
After decelerating for six consecutive years, real GDP growth appears to be inching up in 2017.
The 6.9% annualized increase just reported for the second quarter exceeds the 6.7% rise in 2016 and is well above the consensus of international forecasters who, just a few months ago, expected growth to be closer to 6.5% this year, and to slow further, to 6%, in 2018.
I have long argued that the fixation on headline GDP overlooks deeper issues shaping the China growth debate.
That is because the Chinese economy is in the midst of an extraordinary structural transformation – with a manufacturing-led producer model giving way to an increasingly powerful services-led consumer model.
To the extent that this implies a shift in the mix of GDP away from exceptionally rapid gains in investment and exports, toward relatively slower-growing internal private consumption, a slowdown in overall GDP growth is both inevitable and desirable.
Perceptions of China’s vulnerability need to be considered in this context.
This debate has a long history.
I first caught a whiff of it back in the late 1990s, during the Asian financial crisis.
From Thailand and Indonesia to South Korea and Taiwan, China was widely thought to be next.
An October 1998 cover story in The Economist, vividly illustrated by a Chinese junk getting sucked into a powerful whirlpool, said it all.
Yet nothing could have been further from the truth.
When the dust settled on the virulent pan-regional contagion, the Chinese economy had barely skipped a beat.
Real GDP growth slowed temporarily, to 7.7% in 1998-1999, before reaccelerating to 10.3% in the subsequent decade.
China’s resilience during the Great Financial Crisis was equally telling.
In the midst of the worst global contraction since the 1930s, the Chinese economy still expanded at a 9.4% average annual rate in 2008-2009.
While down from the blistering, unsustainable 12.7% pace recorded during the three years prior to the crisis, this represented only a modest shortfall from the 30-year post-1980 trend of 10%.
Indeed, were it not for China’s resilience in the depths of the recent crisis, world GDP would not have contracted by 0.1% in 2009, but would have plunged by 1.3% – the sharpest decline in global activity of the post-World War II era.
The latest bout of pessimism over the Chinese economy has focused on the twin headwinds of deleveraging and a related tightening of the property market – in essence, a Japanese-like stagnation.
LONDON – In recent weeks, Western media commentators have focused extensively on the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) decision to abolish presidential term limits, which will allow Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely.
Unsurprisingly, they have generally responded to the news with disappointment and skepticism about the Chinese political model.
Many observers assumed that China would inevitably embrace Western-style liberal democracy.
But even though I, too, was slightly taken aback by the CPC’s latest decision, I never considered that simplistic interpretation of modern-day China to be particularly sensible.
Now, let me be clear: I am not going to argue that unelected strongman leadership is superior to Western-style democracy.
If I believed that Xi was preparing to rule China with an iron fist for the next 20-plus years, I would share the doubts of many other commentators.
But allow me to suggest a more open-minded interpretation.
For starters, as Yuen Yuen Ang of the University of Michigan reminds us in her excellent book How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty without adhering to the conventional Western approach to development.
In fact, a young Beijing-based entrepreneur I met recently estimates that at least 20% of Chinese – over 250 million people – are now making $40,000 per year.
Besides the United States, no other country in the world has that many people generating that much individual wealth.
Whether Westerners like to admit it or not, that is a remarkable achievement.
But even more remarkable is the fact that it has happened under a non-democratic system, and that Chinese citizens appear to be rather content.
Although small-scale protests are not uncommon, even among those in the top 20%, they tend to be scattered and fleeting.
Now, think about this.
If China can sustain 5.5-7% annual economic growth for the next 15 years, the number of Chinese earning $40,000 per year could more than double.
In that case, they probably will not be particularly concerned that Xi is still their country’s anointed leader.
This brings me to a second point.
Contrary to the pessimists who have long been wrong about looming threats to China’s GDP growth, I suspect that China’s ultimate undoing could actually be its hukou (household registration) system.
Should China Be Ejected from the SDR?
SANTA BARBARA – Last week, the Chinese government tightened its grip on the renminbi’s exchange rate.
China has now effectively reneged on a promise it made 18 months ago, when it lobbied its way into the basket of currencies that determines the value of the International Monetary Fund’s synthetic reserve asset, the Special Drawing Right (SDR).
China’s latest move will hardly strengthen confidence in its currency.
As some of us warned at the time, the renminbi’s admission to the SDR basket was a highly political decision that could have adverse long-term consequences.
The basket had previously comprised the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen – all world-class currencies that meet the IMF’s two criteria for admission: they are issued by the world’s leading exporters, and they are “freely usable,” meaning that they are widely exchanged worldwide.
By contrast, the renminbi met only the first criterion when it was included in the SDR.
Although China was already the world’s largest exporting country, its financial markets were primitive, and its currency plainly fell far short of being freely usable.
In 2015, the renminbi ranked seventh in global central-bank reserves, eighth in international bond issuance, and 11th in global currency trading; and it remained non-convertible for most capital-account transactions.
Still, the renminbi was admitted.
China had made it abundantly clear that it would not be happy with a negative decision, and no one wanted to poke the dragon.
But rather than upholding its usual standards, the IMF and its principal members settled for China’s vague promise to make the renminbi more usable sometime in the future.
Historically, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had fixed the renminbi’s exchange rate on a daily basis, without regard to underlying market sentiment; and it had allowed for the renminbi to trade only within very narrow limits.
But even before the IMF decided to include the renminbi in the SDR, the Chinese government announced that it was loosening its control over the currency.
The PBOC declared that market signals would henceforth be factored into its daily exchange-rate fixing.
And it promised gradual liberalization of China’s capital controls, which would boost the renminbi’s attractiveness to investors.
And yet the Chinese authorities’ latest move indicates that they have no intention of playing by the rules.
Instead of further loosening its grip on the exchange rate, the PBOC is reasserting control and reducing the role of market sentiment in its decision-making.
The proof is in the pudding: the renminbi is clearly less freely usable than it was 18 months ago.
Since mid-2016, China has been imposing strict new capital controls to prevent the renminbi from pouring out of the country and being converted into dollars.
HONG KONG – At the recently concluded World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Chinese President Xi Jinping mounted a robust defense of globalization, reaffirming his country’s “open door” policy and pledging never to seek to start a trade war or to benefit from devaluation of its currency.
Soon after, US President Donald Trump, in his inaugural address, effectively made the opposite pledge: using the word “protect” seven times, he confirmed that his “America first” doctrine means protectionism.
Trump speaks of the United States as an economy in decline that must be revitalized.
But the reality is that the US economy has been performing rather well in the last two years.
Its recovery has outpaced that of other advanced economies; job creation has been impressive; and the dollar has been strong.
The dollar’s value has risen particularly high in the last few months, as Trump’s promises to increase government spending, lower business taxes, and cut regulation have inspired a flight to quality by investors.
By contrast, the Chinese renminbi has weakened significantly – from CN¥6.2 per dollar at the end of 2014 to CN¥6.95 at the end of last year – owing largely to declining investment and exports.
Trump has accused China of intentionally devaluing the renminbi, in order to boost its export competitiveness.
But the truth is quite the opposite: in the face of strong downward pressure on the renminbi, China has sought to keep the renminbi-dollar exchange rate relatively stable, – an effort that has contributed to a decline of more than $1 trillion in official foreign-currency reserves.
China does not want the renminbi to depreciate any more than Trump does.
But no country has full control over its exchange rate.
One factor affecting exchange rates is a rapidly changing global supply chain.
Evolving consumption patterns, regulatory regimes, and digital technologies have lately encouraged more domestic production.
In the US, manufacturing has received a boost from technologies like robotics and 3D printing.
That has supported economic recovery, without increasing its imports from Asia.
Meanwhile, China is already shifting from an export-driven growth model to one based on higher domestic consumption, so a stronger renminbi might serve its economy better.
China’s current-account surplus fell to just 2.1% of GDP in 2016, and the International Monetary Fund projects it to narrow further, as exports continue to fall.
But the current account is not the only relevant factor.
Lies, Damn Lies, and Vietnam’s Trade Statistics
SINGAPORE – On April 17, Bloomberg reported that China had overtaken the United States as Vietnam’s largest export market.
According to figures cited by the news organization and tallied by the International Monetary Fund, Vietnam’s exports to China totaled $50.6 billion in 2017, compared to $46.5 billion in exports to the US.
If these numbers are accurate, they would represent a significant shift in the triangular relationship between Vietnam, China, and the US.
As Bloomberg succinctly put it, the data underscore how the world’s second-largest economy is “growing its influence in the region” at the expense of the US.
Preliminary statistics from the General Department of Vietnam Customs (GDVC), which oversees Vietnam’s trade data, contradict the IMF assessment. According to the GDVC, exports to the US last year totaled $41.6 billion, while exports to China stood at $35.5 billion.
In other words, by Vietnam’s count, the US remained its largest export market by a margin of 17%, a gap that held steady during the first three months of 2018.
So, what can account for the discrepancies between the official data and the IMF’s figures?
One possible explanation is methodological: the Fund and the GDVC simply used different formulas to arrive at their estimates.
But a gap of $15.1 billion on the China side of the ledger makes this highly unlikely.
Another possibility is that the IMF sourced its data exclusively from Chinese authorities.
But evidence for that scenario is thin.
A third theory – which, admittedly, is impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt – may be the most credible: both sides manipulated annual and monthly trade data to bolster their own narratives.
For Vietnam, data indicating lower exports would support the government’s efforts to extend trade deeper into Chinese markets.
Plagued by a large and persistent bilateral trade deficit, Vietnamese officials have long requested that their Chinese counterparts allow more imports from Vietnam.
The numbers released by GDVC would advance – or at least not undermine – that goal.
For China, on the other hand, inflating the figures for imports from Vietnam could help neutralize such a request, reminding the Vietnamese authorities of how important trade with China is to their country’s economy.
Higher trade figures may persuade Vietnam to maintain friendly bilateral ties, and perhaps even to adopt more accommodating positions on thorny regional security issues, such as the South China Sea dispute.
Russia’s Cold War Habit
MOSCOW – A few weeks ago, Mikhail Gorbachev – the last leader of the Soviet Union and the man who did more than anyone to end the Cold War – told the German newspaper Bild that it is possible “to recognize all the features of a new cold war in today’s world.”
The United States “has already dragged” Russia into it, Gorbachev has said, in an effort “to realize its general triumphalist idea.”
But is the current antagonism between the US and Russia really “new”?
And is it credible to place the blame overwhelmingly on the US, as Gorbachev and certainly the Kremlin are inclined to do?
To answer these questions, we must look to history – beginning long before Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain Speech” in 1946.
In fact, the adversarial relationship between Russia and the West began over a century before the Cold War.
Back in the 1820s, Russia emerged not only as the principal victor in the Napoleonic wars, but also as the most conservative – or, more accurately, reactionary – force in Europe.
Under Czars Alexander I and Nicholas I, it stood ready to counter any sign of a renewal of the “revolutionary plague” infecting the continent’s monarchies.
By 1830, the rift between the “Holy Alliance” countries (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) and the rest of Europe was deep.
And, when Russia suppressed two “color” revolutions – the Polish revolt of 1830-1831 and the Hungarian revolution of 1848-1849 – it became even deeper.
Both interventions incited a massive surge in anti-Russian sentiment across the continent.
To strengthen Russia’s position, Nicholas I looked to the Orthodox populations in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire, with his naval minister, Alexander Menshikov, demanding in 1853 that Russia be named an official protector of the Ottoman Empire’s 12 million Orthodox citizens.
When the demand was rejected, Russian troops occupied Ottoman-controlled Moldavia and Wallachia – a move that eventually led to the Crimean War, which Russia lost spectacularly in 1856.
To my mind, that loss marks the end of a first, roughly 30-year Cold War between Russia and Europe.
What most people think of as the Cold War began nearly a century later, after World War II, when the Soviet Union, seeking to expand its sphere of influence, installed communist governments from Poland to Bulgaria.
In 1946, it began to destabilize Greece, and at the Council of Foreign Ministers, established under the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, the Kremlin demanded control over Tripolitania in North Africa – a demand that Western leaders rejected.
The next year, the Soviet Union prevented its satellite states from participating in the Marshall Plan, aimed at restoring Europe’s economy after the war.
Joseph Stalin subsequently imposed a blockade on West Berlin, in a failed effort to enforce compliance with that decision.
The Cold War brought the Soviet Union and the US to the brink of war over Korea in the 1950s and Cuba in 1962.
Condemning Khashoggi’s Killers
AMSTERDAM – The details of the brutal, premeditated murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi are astonishing.
Next, there are the alleged perpetrators: a 15-member team that included a forensic doctor who once worked in Australia and brought a bone saw, and a body double who put on Khashoggi’s clothes – probably while they were still warm – and casually slipped out the back door.
But the most shocking revelation may be this: the Saudis knew they could get away with murder.
Recent figures published by UNESCO, the United Nations organization that is tasked, in part, with promoting the safety of journalists worldwide, show that in nine of ten cases, perpetrators are never punished for murdering a journalist.
Because impunity is the norm, Saudi authorities took the gamble that even if the killing came to light, the consequences would be minor.
And they were right: although prosecutors in Saudi Arabia are seeking the death penalty for five of the suspects, the international response has so far been meek.
Despite the global attention the murder has received, most leaders have only promised to “consider” sanctions against Saudi Arabia; others have dismissed the idea outright.
US President Donald Trump, for example, has said that although the official Saudi explanation is unsatisfactory, he has no intention of responding by curbing arms sales or trade.
Leaders in France and Spain have expressed similar sentiments.
Such bluntness illustrates that when economic interests are pitted against human rights, the former always take precedence.
It is not only the loss of a journalist’s life that needs to be mourned, but also the erosion of civil liberties and free speech – especially in the Middle East.
As the Committee to Protect Journalists reported last month, three of Saudi Arabia’s closest regional allies – the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain – issued statements supporting the Kingdom’s response to the Khashoggi killing.
Saudi-owned domestic and pan-Arab media toed the line, too, while an army of online trolls quickly set to work to defend the Kingdom’s rulers and smear its critics.
This type of whitewash is not limited to the Khashoggi case; it is even harder to find serious criticism in mainstream Arab media of the Saudi-led war in Yemen.
With tens of thousands dead and a devastating famine threatening to kill millions more, the region’s news outlets are virtually silent on the role of the Kingdom’s interventionist crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
If the international community genuinely cares about defending human rights, the rule of law, and democratic values, it must denounce Saudi Arabia’s brutality.
One of the Middle East’s most powerful countries is directly responsible for widespread death, destruction, and misery.
And yet Western countries are not only condoning these activities; in some cases, they are actively facilitating them by supplying the weapons.
Coming Clean in 2018
LONDON – It has been a bumper year for making the invisible visible.
The last 12 months have overflowed with leaks, allegations, and other disclosures, not just of misconduct by individuals, business leaders, and politicians, but also of proactive schemes to prevent that misconduct from ever coming to light.
Last month, it came out that a 20-year-old hacker breached Uber’s system in 2016 and accessed the information of about 57 million people, including some 600,000 of its drivers in the United States.
Rather than admit to the security flaw, Uber quietly paid the culprit $100,000 to destroy the data, in the hope that the victims – and, perhaps more important to Uber, the company’s investors – would never find out.
The Equifax data breach – in which hackers gained access to sensitive personal information, from birth dates to Social Security numbers, for about 143 million US customers – was not covered up to quite the same degree.
But there was still a six-week period between discovery of the breach and disclosure to the public, during which three executives sold a small share of their stock, though they insist they had no knowledge of the breach at the time.
A security breach is frustrating, even infuriating, for customers and investors.
But willful denial of such a breach decimates trust.
If a company discloses a breach, at least customers know they can expect to be told what is happening with their information (and can keep watch for fraudulent activity on their accounts), and investors can assess business risk accurately.
If the truth comes out much later – as in the case of Uber, in particular – a story about a technical problem quickly becomes a story about corporate integrity.
Consumers’ fears about sharing personal information with companies – difficult to avoid in modern life – deepen, and business becomes an object of heightened skepticism.
But businesses have not just been covering up mistakes; they have also been hiding major crimes by senior figures.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the long-term patterns of sexual harassment and cover-ups that have been exposed in recent months.
At Fox News, leading personalities – from commentator Bill O’Reilly to the company’s chair, Roger Ailes – were long protected by the network’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, in the face of allegations of sexual harassment.
Not only did 21st Century Fox help to keep quiet a $32 million settlement reached in January between O’Reilly and a frequent guest on his show (at least the fifth such settlement over O’Reilly’s behavior); the company offered its star a highly lucrative new contract soon after.
O’Reilly was eventually pushed out, but only after the truth about the allegations and settlements were revealed to the public.
The company followed essentially the same script with regard to Ailes during his 20-year tenure.
A similar machine protected the Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein during his decades of using his position of power to harass and assault women. As The New York Times recently documented, Weinstein received help from all sides.
His brother and partner, Robert Weinstein, participated in the payoffs.
A World Turned Inside Out
NEW HAVEN – Slowly but surely, a bruised and battered global economy now appears to be shaking off its deep post-crisis malaise.
If the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecasts are borne out – an iffy proposition, to be sure – the nearly 3.6% average annual growth in world GDP expected over the 2017-2018 period would represent a modest uptick from the 3.2% pace of the past two years.
Fully a decade after the Great Financial Crisis, global growth is finally returning to its 3.5% post-1980 trend.
But this round trip hardly signals that the world is back to normal.
On the contrary, the overhyped idea of a “new normal” for the world economy overlooks an extraordinary transformation in the global growth dynamic over the past nine years.
At the margin, the recent improvement has been concentrated in the advanced economies, where GDP growth is now expected to average 2% over 2017-2018 – a meaningful pick-up from the unprecedentedly anemic 1.1% average growth of the preceding nine years.
Relative strength in the United States (2.4%) is expected to be offset by weakness in both Europe (1.7%) and of course Japan (0.9%).
By contrast, the developing world keeps chugging along at a much faster pace.
Although the average growth rate expected for these economies over 2017-2018, at 4.6%, is about half a percentage point lower than during the preceding nine years, they would still be expanding at more than twice the pace of the developed world. Unsurprisingly (at least to those of us who never bought into the Chinese hard-landing scenario), strength in the developing world is expected to be concentrated in China (6.4%) and India (7.5%), with growth lagging in Latin America (1.5%) and Russia (1.4%).
This persistent divergence between developed and developing economies has now reached a critical point.
From 1980 to 2007, the advanced economies accounted for an average of 59% of world GDP (measured in terms of purchasing power parity), whereas the combined share of developing and emerging economies was 41%.
That was then.
According to the IMF’s latest forecast, those shares will completely reverse by 2018: 41% for the advanced economies and 59% for the developing world.
The pendulum of world economic growth has swung dramatically from the so-called advanced countries to the emerging and developing economies.
New?
Absolutely.
Normal?
Not even close.
No Blank Check for Development Banks
NEW YORK – Global financial leaders are convening in Washington, DC, this week for the annual spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.
This year, they will ask the world’s taxpayers to grant the World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) more capital to fill global infrastructure gaps.
Increasing the capital – and optimizing the existing capital – of the world’s MDBs is of the utmost importance.
But doing so makes sense only if that financing is used to move the world economy in a direction consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
According to researchers at the Brookings Institution, the world needs to invest an additional $3 trillion per year in sustainable infrastructure in order to keep global warming below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels – the target enshrined in both the SDGs and the Paris agreement.
Today, however, infrastructure contributes heavily to global warming, with about 70% of all greenhouse-gas emissions coming from its construction and operation.
That means that the infrastructure we build – or cease to build – can determine whether we will achieve global climate goals.
It will also determine whether safe and affordable infrastructure services (for example, water, sanitation, electricity, and health care) can be scaled up to meet other SDGs, such as eliminating poverty.
Private capital markets are inherently biased toward short-termism, and tend not to finance long-term investments in infrastructure.
And while national governments provide more than 75% of financing for infrastructure, they tend to avoid massive expenditures for new projects, particularly sustainable infrastructure.
Moreover, many governments have come to prefer public-private partnerships that allow them to keep liabilities off-budget.
And, as the IMF recently found, governments often launch infrastructure projects as a way to swing votes in the run-up to elections. Longer-term sustainability concerns (including infrastructure maintenance) thus usually take a back seat to political motives.
In light of these shortcomings, development banks have a unique role to play in harnessing expertise and bringing together stakeholders to finance the right kinds of infrastructure.
To that end, in 2015, the World Bank and other MDBs launched a strategy to increase development financing “from billions to trillions,” by using public finance to “crowd in” private investment, especially from large institutional investors like pension and insurance funds.
But, since then, the World Bank has rebranded its approach as “maximizing finance for development” (MFD), while failing to demonstrate how it will actually achieve the SDGs.
This strategic uncertainty should serve as a reminder that, while MDBs have a critical role to play, they should not be given carte blanche.
A Dim Outlook for Trumponomics
NEW YORK – Now that US President Donald Trump has been in office for six months, we can more confidently assess the prospects for the US economy and economic policymaking under his administration.
And, like Trump’s presidency more generally, paradoxes abound.
The main puzzle is the disconnect between the performance of financial markets and the real.
While stock markets continue to reach new highs, the US economy grew at an average rate of just 2% in the first half of 2017 – slower growth than under President Barack Obama – and is not expected to perform much better for the rest of the year.
Stock-market investors continue to hold out hope that Trump can push through policies to stimulate growth and increase corporate profits.
Moreover, sluggish wage growth implies that inflation is not reaching the US Federal Reserve’s target rate, which means that the Fed will have to normalize interest rates more slowly than expected.
Lower long-term interest rates and a weaker dollar are good news for US stock markets, and Trump’s pro-business agenda is still good for individual stocks in principle, even if the air has been let out of the so-called Trump reflation trade.
And there is now less reason to worry that a massive fiscal-stimulus program will push up the dollar and force the Fed to raise rates.
In view of the Trump administration’s political ineffectiveness, it is safe to assume that if there is any stimulus at all, it will be smaller than expected.
The administration’s inability to execute on the economic-policy front is unlikely to change.
Congressional Republicans’ attempts to replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) have failed, not least because moderate Republicans refused to vote for a bill that would deprive some 20 million Americans of their health insurance.
The Trump administration is now moving on to tax reform, which will be just as hard, if not harder, to enact.
That leaves congressional Republicans with little room for maneuver.
Because the US Senate’s budget-reconciliation rules require all tax cuts to be revenue-neutral after ten years, Republicans will either have to cut tax rates by far less than they had originally intended, or settle for temporary and limited tax cuts that aren’t paid for.
To benefit American workers and spur economic growth, tax reforms need to increase the burden on the rich, and provide relief to workers and the middle class.
But Trump’s proposals would do the opposite: depending on which plan you look at, 80-90% of the benefits would go to the top 10% of the income distribution.
More to the point, US corporations aren’t hoarding trillions of dollars in cash and refusing to make capital investments because the tax rate is too high, as Trump and congressional Republicans claim.
Rather, firms are less inclined to invest because slow wage growth is depressing consumption, and thus overall economic growth.
Addicted to Dollars
FRANKFURT – Since the end of World War II, the United States’ share in world GDP has fallen from nearly 30% to about 18%.
Other advanced economies have also experienced sustained declines in their respective slices of the global pie.
But you wouldn’t know it from looking at the international monetary system.
Over the same period, China’s share of world GDP almost quadrupled, to around 16% (just behind the US), and emerging markets now account for about 60% of global output, up from about 40% in the immediate post-war years.
Given that advanced-economies’ growth prospects remain subdued, these trends are likely to continue – even with the evident slowing in China and other emerging markets.
And yet global finance has not mirrored this shift in balance from the advanced to the emerging.
The post-war Bretton Woods arrangements institutionalized the role of the US dollar as the main reserve currency, and until the 1970s, about two-thirds of global GDP was anchored to the greenback.
The remainder was largely split between the British pound and the Soviet ruble.
In a recent study that I undertook with Ethan Ilzetzki and Kenneth Rogoff, we document that the US dollar has retained its dominant position as the world’s reserve currency – and by a significant margin.
Over 60% of all countries (accounting for more than 70% of world GDP) use the US dollar as their anchor currency.
Other metrics, which include the proportion of trade invoiced in dollars and the share of US assets (notably Treasuries) in central banks’ foreign exchange reserves, suggest a similar degree of “dollar dominance.”
The euro is a distant second.
From the early 1980s until the introduction of the euro in 1999, the Deutsche Mark’s (DM) influence expanded first in Western Europe and later in Eastern Europe.
But the rise of the euro, which consolidated the DM and French franc (Africa) zones, appears to have stalled.
By some measures (given the shrinking share of Europe in world output), its global importance has declined.
No other major established international currencies currently compete for global leadership.
The divergence between the trends for production and finance, shown in the figure, emerges as a relatively smaller US economy supplies reserve assets in step with rising global demand for them (primarily from emerging markets).
This divergence is not entirely new.
With recovery from WWII underway in Europe and global trade expanding, demand for reserves grew rapidly in the 1950s and remained high into the early 1970s.
Three Surprises in 2017
LONDON – Economic pundits traditionally offer their (traditionally inaccurate) New Year predictions at the beginning of January.
But global conditions this year are anything but traditional, so it seemed appropriate to wait until US President Donald Trump settled into the White House to weigh in on some of the main surprises that might shake up the world economy and financial markets on his watch.
Judging by current market movements and conditions, the world could be caught off guard by three potentially transformative developments.
For starters, Trump’s economic policies are likely to produce much higher US interest rates and inflation than financial markets expect.
Trump’s election has almost certainly ended the 35-year trend of disinflation and declining rates that began in 1981, and that has been the dominant influence on economic conditions and asset prices worldwide.
But investors and policymakers don’t believe it yet.
The US Federal Reserve Board’s published forecasts suggest only three quarter-point rate hikes this year, and futures markets have priced in just two such moves.
As Trump launches his policies, however, the Fed is likely to tighten its monetary policy more than it had planned before the inauguration, not less, as the markets still expect.
More important, as Trump’s policies boost both real economic activity and inflation, long-term interest rates, which influence the world economy more than the overnight rates set by central banks, are likely to rise steeply.
The rationale for this scenario is straightforward.
Trump’s tax and spending plans will sharply reverse the budget consolidation enforced by Congress on Barack Obama’s administration, and household borrowing will expand dramatically if Trump fulfills his promise to reverse the bank regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.
As all this extra stimulus fuels an economy already nearing full employment, inflation seems bound to accelerate, with protectionist trade tariffs and a possible “border tax” raising prices even more for imported goods.
The only uncertainty is how monetary policy will respond to this “Trumpflation.”
But whether the Fed tries to counteract it by raising interest rates more aggressively than its current forecasts imply, or decides to move cautiously, keeping short-term interest rates well behind the rising curve of price growth, bond investors will suffer.
As a result, yields on ten-year US bonds could jump from 2.5% to 3.5% or more in the year ahead – and ultimately much higher.
In Europe and Japan, by contrast, monetary conditions will remain loose, as central banks continue to support economic growth with zero interest rates and quantitative easing (QE).
And this policy divergence suggests a second potential shock for which financial markets seem unprepared.
The US dollar could strengthen much further, especially against emerging-market currencies, despite Trump’s stated desire to boost US exports.
The catalyst for exchange-rate appreciation would be not only higher US interest rates, but also a dollar squeeze in emerging markets, where foreign debts have increased by $3 trillion since 2010.
Can Macron Redraw the Political Map?
WASHINGTON, DC – Many commentators have described Emmanuel Macron’s victory in the French presidential election as a triumph for the center right, because he received votes that otherwise would have gone to the scandal-plagued mainstream conservative candidate, François Fillon.
But this electoral dynamic does not capture the meaning of Macron’s victory.
It would be more accurate to say that Macron cut through traditional party divides and stood as a candidate for those who believe that, with proper management and new technologies, European integration and the forces of globalization can deliver widely shared benefits.
By contrast, most of Macron’s opponents simply stoked fears about today’s economic realities.
Consider the following statistics from the French presidential election’s first round: 42% of Macron’s supporters have in the past sympathized with the Socialist Party; and another 36% have tended to support centrists.
These data indicate that voters on the left and in the center constitute the bulk of Macron’s support base, and that they regarded him as a center-left, rather than a center-right, candidate.
Indeed, Macron hails from the modern, pro-globalization center left.
He was most recently a member of former French President François Hollande’s government; and, earlier in his career, his mentor was former Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard.
But even if Macron did not make a clean break with his political past, he broke through traditional party and political-identity barriers, by reaching out to voters across the political spectrum, except for those on the extreme left and extreme right.
If anything, the many attempts to squeeze Macron into a traditional French political archetype show that European and global politics desperately need to be reframed to account for new arguments, narratives, and fault lines.
The transitional government that Macron formed just after the election reflects great diversity, not only in terms of gender, but also with respect to political experience and affiliation.
Macron’s cabinet draws from centrist, leftist, and right-leaning parties, including the Socialists and Greens.
But his appointment of center-right Republicans such as Bruno Le Maire and Gérald Darmanin is of particular importance, because polling data indicate that Macron’s message resonated the least with right-leaning voters.
Moreover, by appointing Édouard Philippe, also of the Republicans, as his prime minister, Macron firmed up his commitment to transforming French politics.
His government will span the political spectrum from day one.
And with such diverse political representation, Macron could bolster the prospects of his own party, La République En Marche !, in the National Assembly election this month.
A strong showing would significantly improve his chances of fulfilling key campaign promises.
As a social-liberal policymaker with a good understanding of how the global economy works, Macron could become what progressives everywhere have been looking for.
To do that, he will have to forge a new social contract that protects the most vulnerable from the rapid shifts and abrupt disruptions inherent in a flexible, open twenty-first-century economy.
The End of AIDS
NEW YORK – The AIDS pandemic claimed around 36 million lives between 1981 and 2016, and a similar number around the world currently live with the HIV virus.
Some 1.2 million people died of AIDS last year, and another 1.8 million were infected.
Those statistics are daunting, but the startling news is that the goal of an “AIDS-Free Generation” is realistically within reach.
The required policy steps should be agreed in the early days of US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.
The key reason that the epidemic can be ended is a scientific finding back in 2011 that showed that HIV-positive individuals receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment suppress the HIV virus in their bloodstreams so dramatically that they are very unlikely to transmit the virus to others through sex or shared needles.
This finding confirmed the concept of “treatment as prevention.”
If a high enough proportion of HIV-positive individuals receive ARV treatment, it is possible not only to save their lives, but also to break the transmission of the virus itself, thereby ending the epidemic.
Building on this idea, AIDS specialists developed two crucial ideas: “90-90-90” and the “cascade of AIDS care.”
The 90-90-90 program aims to ensure that by the year 2020, 90% of all HIV-infected individuals know that they are infected (the first 90); 90% of all those who know they are infected are receiving ARV treatment (the second 90); and 90% of all those receiving ARV treatment successfully suppress the HIV virus in the blood.
The idea of the cascade is that if each of the three “90s” is achieved, the proportion of all HIV-infected individuals with viral suppression would be 90% x 90% x 90%, which is equal to 72%.
If 72% of those infected today can no longer infect others, the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be curtailed.
Indeed, if 90-90-90 in 2020 becomes 95-95-95 by the year 2030, the proportion of HIV-positive individuals that cannot infect others would rise to 86%.
The ongoing epidemic would grind to a halt, just as a measles epidemic among children in a metropolitan area ends when 80% percent of the children are vaccinated, even if the other 20% percent of children remain unvaccinated.
Some cases would remain, but the AIDS catastrophe would be over.
The goal of reaching 90-90-90 by the year 2020 and 95-95-95 by 2030 is realistic, if countries strive for success.
Sweden recently announced that it has reached the 90-90-90 targets.
Many other high-income countries are close.
With international help and national efforts, 90-90-90 could be achieved not only in high-income countries but in developing countries as well.
For most of the world, the biggest challenge is ensuring that by 2020 at least 90% of HIV-positive individuals are tested and learn that they are infected – the first of the three 90s.
Will Italy Sink Europe?
LONDON – Despite political turmoil and emerging risks at the global level, the eurozone has had two years of strong economic growth, at least by its own historically disappointing standards – and even with the United Kingdom lurching toward withdrawal from the European Union.
But with the emergence of a populist government in Italy this year, it is no longer safe to assume that the eurozone’s worst days are behind it.
Italy was the first country that I studied when I entered the financial world back in 1982, so I have a special affection for it.
I was working for a very large American bank at the time, and I can still remember joining frequent transatlantic conference calls to discuss Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio.
The question on everyone’s mind was when the country would default; but it never did.
Instead, Italy muddled through, and has continued to do so ever since.
Still, now that the Italian government seems poised for a standoff with the EU, it would not be surprising if worries about a default were to re-emerge.
As my experience more than 30 years ago shows, Italy’s economic problems far predate its adoption of the euro.
It has long had poor productivity by European standards, and that translated into relatively low trend growth in the pre-euro decades.
At the same time, occasional spurts of faster growth regularly sowed the seeds for various crises, often resulting in devaluations of the Italian currency, the lira.
Of course, there are some who now yearn for the days when the lira could be weakened to restore growth.
That is no longer an option under the single currency.
But what the pre-euro romanticists overlook is that euro membership has given Italy low inflation, and thus lower interest rates.
Moreover, there is reason to think that lira devaluations did more harm than good.
Even if they offered an occasional competitive boost, they stood in for tougher structural reforms that would have increased productivity over the long term.
There are also some who believe that the eurozone’s fiscal and monetary framework locks Italy into weak nominal GDP growth, possibly too-low inflation, and high debt.
Yet before the new government took office, Italy’s cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit – as opposed to its underlying debt position – was often rather restrained compared to the rest of the eurozone, as well as the other members of the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
Still, the mainstream political parties that governed Italy until this year did not deliver the nominal GDP growth that the country needs.
As a result, Italians elected an unconventional coalition whose program combines the policies of the populist left with those of the populist right.
Europe’s Left Turns Right on Immigration
BERLIN – Europe’s established left is facing the threat of extinction.
In less than two years, the continent’s social-democratic parties have suffered historic losses in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy.
On a continent long defined by democratic competition between center-right and center-left parties, the collapse of the left could have far-reaching consequences, beyond particular party interests.
Many factors underlie the left’s decline, including the dissolution of the traditional working class.
But one of the most important reasons is as grim as it is simple: European voters are increasingly opposed to immigration, and do not trust the left to limit it.
Faced with a sustained influx of refugees and migrants, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, European voters have transformed a series of recent elections into popular referenda on immigration.
Right-wing populist movements have skillfully played on blue-collar voters’ fears by convincing them that traditional labor parties will allow immigrants to flow in virtually unchecked.
In April, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán won a landslide election victory after running a campaign that focused on the “threat” to “Christian values” supposedly posed by Muslim immigrants.
Italy’s new anti-establishment coalition government was propelled to power by the popularity of the staunchly anti-immigrant League party, led by Matteo Salvini, who is now interior minister and deputy prime minister.
In Slovenia, former Prime Minister Janez Janša’s right-wing opposition party secured just under 25% of the vote in this month’s parliamentary election, meaning that Janša will form the country’s next government.
Echoing US President Donald Trump, Janša campaigned on an anti-immigrant “Slovenia first” platform.
When right-wing populists first started gaining political traction, Europe’s center-left parties hoped that their traditional strengths would enable them to weather the challenge.
To avoid unwittingly strengthening right-wing narratives, center-left campaigners attempted to shift public debate toward their ideological comfort zone: unemployment, inequality, and social justice.
Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) based its entire 2017 election campaign on the slogan, “It’s time for more justice.”
Yet defeat after painful defeat has driven center-left parties to a stark realization: voters who are concerned primarily with immigration are not going to be won over with calls – however justified – for equality.
As a result, center-left parties across Europe have begun to change course, with social democrats in several key countries changing long-held positions on migration.
In Germany, the coalition government (comprising the SPD, the Christian Democratic Union, and the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union) is embroiled in a bitter fight over immigration that threatens the survival of the coalition.
While the SPD aims for a European solution and rejects sealing Germany’s borders, party leader Andrea Nahles called for accelerated asylum procedures that would enable authorities to conclude asylum applications from safe third countries within one week.
Last month, Nahles launched the debate within the SPD when, seemingly echoing right-wing rhetoric, she declared that Germany “cannot accept all.”
Why Europe Still Needs Cash
FRANKFURT – Payment systems in Europe are facing upheaval.
With the digital revolution offering ever-faster and more convenient means for settling transactions, cash seems to some to have no future.
But to write off the role of banknotes and coins in the economy would be a mistake.
Non-cash payment options have been proliferating in recent years.
Credit cards, online transfers, and direct-debit payments are already well established.
Now, smartphone-enabled digital-payment solutions and mobile wallets are also gaining ground.
The emergence of potentially disruptive innovations like distributed ledger technologies indicate that further and possibly fundamental change may be on the horizon.
Independent of these new and incipient options, there are a number of studies making the case to abolish cash.
Advocates of a cashless society tend to fall into three distinct camps.
The first camp, the alchemists, wants to overcome the restrictions that the zero lower bound (ZLB) imposes on monetary policy.
The second, the law and order camp, wants to cancel the primary means of payment for illicit activities.
And the third camp, the fintech (financial technology) alliance, anticipates major business opportunities arising from the elimination of the high storage, issuance, and handling costs of cash that the financial industry currently faces.
But the arguments for going cashless do not withstand scrutiny. Start with the alchemists’ case.
It is true that, in an environment of very low interest rates, the conduct of monetary policy becomes difficult.
Yet experience has shown that the effective lower bound is different from the ZLB.
Indeed, negative interest rates have worked, without triggering a flight to cash, especially when combined with outright asset purchases, long-term credit operations (including “fixed-rate full allotment” and “targeted” variants), and forward guidance. As such, negative interest rates should be understood as a specific non-standard monetary-policy instrument different from low interest rates.
The law-and-order camp’s case for banning cash also wilts under scrutiny.
By acting as a store of value and a means of payment, cash fulfills an important social function for many law-abiding citizens.
Would anyone suggest forbidding private ownership of luxury cars or gems because criminals like them?
Who Will Be Europe’s Alexander Hamilton?
TILBURG – Not too long ago, the European Central Bank’s actions were usually met with cheers.
But more recently, the ECB has drawn criticism from not just bankers and economists, but also citizens and politicians.
With returns on fixed-income investments decreasing, investors are being forced into equity investments, which have become riskier and more expensive, owing to increased uncertainty about financial and economic stability.
That uncertainty reflects the fact that the ECB’s extremely low interest rates are serving to prevent desperately needed structural reforms in eurozone countries with high deficits and debt.
The big question now is whether the ECB’s current monetary policies are doing more harm than good.
The ECB’s official aim is to reach an inflation target of close to 2%.
But despite massive liquidity injections, the eurozone’s inflation rate has fallen, indicating that there is insufficient demand in the real economy.
Indeed, demand is stagnating because many companies cannot make investments until they have reduced their debts.
Moreover, eurozone countries are feeling the effects of falling oil prices and slower Chinese growth – two factors on which the ECB’s low interest rates have little bearing.
Central banks can break an inflationary cycle by raising interest rates and creating a liquidity squeeze; but they cannot generate inflation through low interest rates alone.
In other words, the ECB can step on the gas pedal, but if the clutch does not work, the car will not move; it will just create a lot of noise.
Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring Europe’s economic recovery rests with national governments.
The ECB has pulled the eurozone’s proverbial chestnuts out of the financial fire.
But in doing so, it has felt the hot breath of financial institutions, which had previously abstained from contradicting ECB President Mario Draghi’s policies, at least in public.
The ECB should, of course, maintain supportive monetary policies.
But stronger eurozone countries such as Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands must now play the role of pioneer.
To this end, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, headed by Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands, should set the agenda.
The European Commission should provide it with whatever help it needs through the so-called Six-Pack powers.
And stronger eurozone countries should go beyond monitoring the Stability and Growth Pact to also enact sound stimulus packages and tax reforms.
Three Ways Ahead for the Eurozone
WASHINGTON, DC – After a tumultuous year, politics seem to be stabilizing across Europe.
Though the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) gained almost 13% of the vote in Germany’s recent federal election, it does not pose a serious threat to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leadership.
In France – the other pillar of the European project – President Emmanuel Macron can count on a solid parliamentary majority.
And, despite the uncertainty surrounding the details of Brexit, there is little doubt that, whatever plans the European Union makes, it will be doing so without the United Kingdom as a member.
So now the question is how the EU and, in particular, the eurozone, will move forward.
There are three possibilities.
The first option is a “more united union,” as described by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his state of the union address last month.
Juncker’s vision rejects a multi-speed Europe, in favor of uniform steps by all EU members.
This would mean, for starters, expanding the Schengen Area of border-free travel to include Bulgaria and Romania.
Juncker also called for progress toward a European Social Standards Union embodying a shared understanding of welfare entitlement in the single market.
As for the euro, Juncker stressed that it is meant to be the currency of the entire EU, not just select countries.
With that in mind, the EU should pursue the creation of a full banking union, in which banking rules and supervision are consistent across all member states.
The commissioner for economic and financial affairs should become a European finance minister, and the European Stabilization Mechanism should become the European Monetary Fund.
A year ago, such “hardline” integrationism would have lacked credibility; after all, the UK would never stand for it.
But, with Brexit apparently a sure thing, Juncker’s vision has gained some credibility.
Nonetheless, Juncker’s “one-speed” approach to integration remains highly controversial.
So Macron has set out his own ambitious vision for Europe, which echoes many of Juncker’s proposals, but seems to allow for more differentiation within the EU, at least in the medium term.
For example, if Poland does not want to adopt the euro, it should not be forced to do so, and that decision should not prevent other eurozone countries from moving ahead with integration.
That is why Macron wants a separate eurozone parliament, which would decide on matters that do not pertain to all members of the European Parliament.
The Win-Win Fantasy of Liberal Democracy
WASHINGTON, DC – Few analysts expected Britons to vote to exit the European Union or Americans to choose Donald Trump as their next president.
Yet it did not take long for a consensus explanation of these miscalculations to emerge.
When it comes to such complex and consequential developments, however, we should beware of facile reasoning.
The current consensus blames the “elites” – in academia, media, and business – for becoming so caught up in their relatively cosmopolitan and connected world that they failed to listen carefully to less educated and connected groups.
Because the latter groups are those that have benefited the least from globalization, they were the most likely to reject supranational institutions (in the case of Brexit) or establishment candidates (in the case of Trump).
Ignoring them was, in many ways, an obvious mistake.
There is considerable merit to this view.
“Group think” regularly afflicts today’s financial and intellectual elite, including pollsters, who often have similar educational backgrounds, work together, read the same media, and congregate at the same conferences and events, from Davos to Aspen.
Members of this crowd tend to believe that they have absorbed the great lessons of history.
They tend to decry racism and even milder forms of ethnocentrism, and are unlikely to reject feminism.
Though these groups are not paragons of diversity, there is a widespread recognition of diversity’s value, and the dominance of men, at least, is beginning to decline.
The other common denominator of this group is wealth.
While not all members of this group are multimillionaires, they do tend to have the education and skills needed to reap the benefits of economic globalization.
As a result, they did not generally recognize rising inequality, particularly in the US, as a major problem until recently (though, to be sure, many of the wealthiest elites have engaged in an unprecedented amount of philanthropy).
It is clear that the cosmopolitan elites who are making consequential decisions in critical sectors, from business and finance to politics, must pay more attention to the grievances of the less fortunate, the less educated, and the less connected.
Rather than congregating with like-minded people in silos, they must create platforms that connect people of more diverse backgrounds and circumstances – including those whose experiences with globalization are very different.
Such platforms would help to address the fragmentation of public debate.
Yet ideological “bubbles” are not the only problem.
For one thing, the elites have failed not only to predict recent populist victories, but also to anticipate that the decidedly non-populist François Fillon would win the French center-right Republicans’ presidential primary by a wide margin.
TOKYO – Interviews are always tricky.
If an unscrupulous interviewer is looking for a particular answer or claim, they have the power to edit, manipulate, or even rewrite their subject’s words to that end.
That is why I have long taken pains to check carefully quotations attributed to me by the media.
But, when it comes to television or radio interviews, it seemed to me that such distortions would be more difficult to pull off.
I was wrong.
Not long ago, representatives from a Japanese television program associated with a liberal-leaning newspaper requested an interview with me to discuss Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-reform strategy, known as “Abenomics.”
I was interviewed for about an hour, with my answers to be included in an episode centered on a panel discussion held in the studio.
The result was not what I expected.
To be sure, I wasn’t entirely shocked to find that the panelists denied the recent achievements of Abenomics and espoused the strange view that monetary policy cannot boost an economy, and yet can suddenly cause hyperinflation.
Such claims have persisted, despite the ongoing monetary-policy-driven, low-inflation recoveries in the United States, Europe, and Japan.
But the distortion of my own words was significant.
In my interview, I highlighted the successes of Abenomics.
And I argued that a strong labor market and rising business profits would be among Abenomics’ enduring legacies, even if Abe’s administration faced political challenges.
The program included just two minutes of my interview, emphasizing the part about the potential political challenges, rather than Abenomics’ great successes.
In recent years, much attention has been devoted to “fake news” – outright disinformation that spreads widely, often through social media or other online platforms.
But my recent experience highlighted another danger: biased news, in which strategic edits surreptitiously advance the views of a journalist, editor, or broadcaster.
Such reporting, which may be delivered even by traditional news organizations, can be very damaging, not least for political leaders.
Without a doubt, Abe’s political standing has been vulnerable to the effects of biased journalism.
For example, several months ago, Abe was addressing a crowd gathered in Akihabara, a district of Tokyo.
When Fighting Fake News Aids Censorship
WASHINGTON, DC – Many media analysts have rightly identified the dangers posed by “fake news,” but often overlook what the phenomenon means for journalists themselves.
Not only has the term become a shorthand way to malign an entire industry; autocrats are invoking it as an excuse to jail reporters and justify censorship, often on trumped-up charges of supporting terrorism.
Around the world, the number of honest journalists jailed for publishing fake or fictitious news is at an all-time high of at least 21.
As non-democratic leaders increasingly use the “fake news” backlash to clamp down on independent media, that number is likely to climb.
The United States, once a world leader in defending free speech, has retreated from this role.
President Donald Trump’s Twitter tirades about “fake news” have given autocratic regimes an example by which to justify their own media crackdowns.
In December, China’s state-run People’s Daily newspaper posted tweets and a Facebook post welcoming Trump’s fake news mantra, noting that it “speaks to a larger truth about Western media.”
This followed the Egyptian government’s praise for the Trump administration in February 2017, when the country’s foreign ministry criticized Western journalists for their coverage of global terrorism.
And in January 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan praised Trump for berating a CNN reporter during a live news conference.
Erdoğan, who criticized the network for its coverage of pro-democracy protests in Turkey in 2013, said that Trump had put the journalist “in his place.”
Trump returned the compliment when he met Erdoğan a few months later.
Praising his counterpart for being an ally in the fight against terrorism, Trump made no mention of Erdoğan’s own dismal record on press freedom.
It is no accident that these three countries have been quickest to embrace Trump’s “fake news” trope.
China, Egypt, and Turkey jailed more than half of the world’s journalists in 2017, continuing a trend from the previous year.
The international community’s silence in the face of these governments’ attacks on independent media seems to have been interpreted as consent.
In Turkey, the world’s top jailer of journalists two years in a row, the erosion of free speech has been particularly swift.
Since a failed coup attempt in 2016, Turkey’s courts have processed some 46,000 cases involving people accused of insulting the president, the nation, or its institutions.
Each of the 73 journalists currently behind bars is being investigated for, or charged with, anti-state crimes.
The most common charge against reporters is belonging to, aiding, or propagandizing for an alleged terrorist organization.
Finishing the Post-Crisis Job
LONDON – August 9, 2017, is the tenth anniversary of the decision by the French bank BNP Paribas to freeze some $2.2 billion worth of money-market funds.
Those of us who were active in financial markets at the time remember that event as the beginning of the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Many economists and financial observers argue that we are still living with the consequences of that crisis, and with the forces that incited it.
This is partly true.
Many developed economies still have in place unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing, and both productivity and real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth appear to be mostly stagnant.
But it is important to put these developments in perspective.
Many people, including the Queen of England in November 2008, still ask: “Why did no one see it coming?”
In fact, many financial observers did warn that housing prices in the United States were rising untenably, especially given the lack of domestic personal savings among US consumers.
As Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs at the time, I had written three different papers over a number of years showing that the US current-account deficit was unsustainable.
Unfortunately, these findings largely fell on deaf ears, and the firm’s foreign-exchange salespeople probably got bored passing on yet more of the same pieces to their clients.
At one point in 2007, the US current-account deficit was reported to be 6-7% of GDP (it has since been revised down to around 5% for the full year).
This high figure reflected the fact that the US trade balance had been steadily deteriorating since the 1990s.
In the absence of any obvious negative consequences, however, complacency had set in, and the US continued to spend more than it saved.
Meanwhile, China had spent the 1990s exporting low-value-added products to the rest of the world, not least to US consumers.
In 2007, its current-account surplus was around 10% of GDP – the mirror image of the US.
Whereas the latter was saving too little, China was saving too much.
For some observers, this huge international imbalance was the source of the crisis.
In the years leading up to the crash, they argued that the global financial system was simply doing its job, by finding increasingly clever ways to recycle the surpluses.
Of course, we now know that it performed that job rather poorly.
Whistling Past the Geopolitical Graveyard
NEW YORK – With Emmanuel Macron’s defeat of the right-wing populist Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election, the European Union and the euro have dodged a bullet.
But geopolitical risks are continuing to proliferate.
The populist backlash against globalization in the West will not be stilled by Macron’s victory, and could still lead to protectionism, trade wars, and sharp restrictions to migration.
If the forces of disintegration take hold, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU could eventually lead to a breakup of the EU – Macron or no Macron.
At the same time, Russia has maintained its aggressive behavior in the Baltics, the Balkans, Ukraine, and Syria.
The Middle East still contains multiple near-failed states, such as Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Lebanon.
And the Sunni-Shia proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran show no sign of ending.
In Asia, US or North Korean brinkmanship could precipitate a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
And China is continuing to engage in – and in some cases escalating – its territorial disputes with regional neighbors.
Despite these geopolitical risks, global financial markets have reached new heights.
So it is worth asking if investors are underestimating the potential for one or more of these conflicts to trigger a more serious crisis, and what it would take to shock them out of their complacency if they are.
There are many explanations for why markets may be ignoring geopolitical risks.
For starters, even with much of the Middle East burning, there have been no oil-supply shocks or embargos, and the shale-gas revolution in the United States has increased the supply of low-cost energy.
During previous Middle East conflicts – such as the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 – oil-supply shocks caused global stagflation and sharp stock-market corrections.
A second explanation is that investors are extrapolating from previous shocks, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001, when policymakers saved the day by backstopping the economy and financial markets with strong monetary and fiscal policy easing.
These policies turned post-shock market corrections into buying opportunities, because the fall in asset prices was reversed in a matter of days or weeks.
Third, the countries that actually have experienced localized asset-market shocks – such as Russia and Ukraine after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and incursion into Eastern Ukraine in 2014 – are not large enough economically to affect US or global financial markets.
Similarly, even as the UK pursues a “hard Brexit,” it still only accounts for around 2% of global GDP.
A fourth explanation is that the world has so far been spared from the tail risks associated with today’s geopolitical conflagrations.
LONDON – In recent weeks, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have affirmed that the financial system is sound and stable.
The US Federal Reserve announced in June that all US banks passed its latest annual stress test.
And Fed Chair Janet Yellen has now suggested that we might not experience another financial crisis “in our lifetimes.”
At the same time, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) – which monitors regulatory practices around the world to ensure that they meet globally-agreed standards – has declared, in a letter to G20 leaders, that “toxic forms of shadow banking” are being eliminated.
In short, ongoing measures to buttress the global financial system have undoubtedly paid off, especially when it comes to strengthening capital cushions and cleaning up balance sheets in important parts of the banking system.
The latest assurances from policymakers are comforting to those of us who worry that not enough has been done to reduce systemic financial risk and to ensure that banks serve the real economy, rather than threaten its wellbeing.
Yet it is too soon to give the financial system as a whole a clean bill of health.
Efforts to shore up the banking sector in some parts of Europe are still lagging far behind.
And, more important, financial risks have continued to migrate to non-bank activities.
After irresponsible risk-taking almost tipped the global economy into a multi-year depression in 2007-2008, regulators and central banks in advanced economies launched a major effort to strengthen their financial systems.
To that end, they focused initially on banks, which have since bolstered their risk-absorbing capital cushions, cleansed murky balance sheets, increased liquidity, enhanced transparency, narrowed the scope of high-risk activities, and partly realigned internal incentives to discourage reckless behavior.
Moreover, the process for resolving failing and failed banks has been improved.
In addition to strengthening the banking sector, policymakers have also made progress toward standardizing derivative markets and making them more robust and transparent, which also reduces the risk of future taxpayer bailouts for irresponsible institutions.
Moreover, the system for payments and settlement has been made safer, thereby lowering the threat of a “sudden stop” in economic activity, like the one that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008.
It has been encouraging to watch national authorities coordinate their efforts under the auspices of the FSB.
Better coordination has reduced the risk of regulatory arbitrage, and address the threat that banks will be, as former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King memorably put it, “international in life but national in death.”
The United States and the United Kingdom took the lead on reform, and Europe has been catching up.
Assuming that it does, as policymakers there intend, Yellen’s assurance of a “much stronger” banking system in the US will apply to all of the other systemically important banking jurisdictions in the developed world, too.
And the FSB’s confident assertion that “reforms have addressed the fault lines that caused the global financial crisis” will receive more support.
LONDON – Back in February, I noted that the global economy at the end of 2016 was in a stronger cyclical position than most people had expected, given the political upheavals of the previous 12 months.
That upward momentum carried through to the first quarter of 2017.
According to the latest “nowcast”-type indicators, world GDP growth is exceeding 4% – perhaps the strongest performance seen since before the 2008 financial crisis.
Still, some observers – and not just chronic pessimists – have countered that the evidence remains anecdotal, and that it is impossible to predict how long the current economic moment will last.
Indeed, there have been other periods in the long post-2008 recovery when growth returned, only to peter out quickly and become sluggish again.
To bolster long-term economic growth, business investment will have to increase.
Unfortunately, this is easier said than done.
In Western economies in particular, non-residential fixed investment is precisely the factor that was missing in previous, short-lived cycles of acceleration.
No one can say for sure why non-residential business investment has failed to recover in recent years.
But I suspect that the slightly pessimistic conventional wisdom on this question is wrong.
The conventional argument asserts that wary CEOs have come to see long-term risks as “just not worth it.”
The many uncertainties they face include concerns about excessive regulation, burdensome corporate taxation, high debt levels, erratic policymaking, the political backlash against globalization, and doubts that consumer spending outside (or even within) the United States will last.
A less pessimistic view holds that, after 2008, it became inevitable that the global economy would unhitch itself from the US consumer engine and adjust to the rise of emerging consumer economies, not least China.
When that happens, we can all live happily ever after.
I tend to side with this less pessimistic crowd.
As I pointed out in March, China’s economy did surprisingly well in the first quarter of 2017, and that seems to be the case in the second quarter as well.
In fact, China’s latest monthly data show signs of economic acceleration, especially in consumption.
And it was evident in the first-quarter data that Chinese consumers are becoming an increasingly important driver of economic growth.
When confronted with the numbers, pessimists respond by insisting that China’s recent strong economic performance is only temporary – a product of yet more unsustainable stimulus.
The Not-So-Dire Future of Work
WASHINGTON, DC – The future of work is a hot topic nowadays.
It has inspired a seemingly endless train of analyses, commentaries, and conferences, and it featured prominently in last week’s annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
For good reason: new technologies – namely, digitization, robotics, and artificial intelligence – have far-reaching implications for employment.
But, contrary to how the story is often framed, a happy ending is possible.
The current debate often skews toward the melodramatic, foretelling a future in which machines drive humans out of work.
According to some bleak estimates, 47% of jobs are at risk in the United States; 57% in the OECD countries; two thirds in developing economies; and half of all jobs globally (around two billion).
But similarly dire predictions of large-scale job destruction and high technology-driven structural unemployment accompanied previous major episodes of automation, including by renowned economists.
John Maynard Keynes offered one; Wassily Leontief provided another.
Neither materialized. Instead, technological change acted as a powerful driver of productivity and employment growth.
Given this, the evolution of work should be viewed as a process of dynamic adjustment, not as a fundamentally destructive process that we should seek to slow.
To erect barriers to innovation, such as taxes on robots, which some have proposed as a way to ease the pressure on workers, would be counterproductive.
Instead, measures should focus on equipping workers with the higher-level skills that a changing labor market demands, and supporting workers during the adjustment process.
So far, education and training have been losing the race with technology.
Shortages of the technical and higher-level skills demanded by new technologies are partly responsible for the paradox of booming technology and slowing productivity growth in advanced economies: skills shortages have constrained the diffusion of innovations.
Imbalances between supply and demand have also fueled income inequality, by increasing the wage premia that those with the right skills can command.
To address these shortcomings, education and training programs must be revamped and expanded.
As the old career path of “learn, work, retire” gives way to one of continuous learning – a process reinforced by the aging of many economies’ workforces – options for reskilling and lifelong education must be scaled up.
LONDON – Last week, Volvo issued an inspiring announcement: it will no longer produce gasoline- or diesel-fueled cars after 2019.
Volvo executives may be anticipating that traditional vehicles will be less profitable in the future.
But whatever their motive, their decision has resonated widely.
Within 24 hours, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would prohibit the sale of gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars by 2040.
Volvo’s decision confirms that things are changing for the auto industry, and it sends a positive message in the fight against climate change.
But, more important, it demonstrates that people and organizations are still capable of taking big, bold steps to solve major challenges.
Among the many global problems today, the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) desperately needs a similar breakthrough commitment.
For advocates, AMR’s appearance on the G20’s agenda last year, at the group’s summit in Hangzhou, China, represented a major triumph.
But G20 leaders’ 2016 statement on AMR was not as bold as it could have been, because they did not want to set the bar too high.
They knew that Germany, an enthusiastic champion in the fight against AMR, would be chairing the G20 this year, and could be expected to bring bold proposals to the table.
In the run-up to this year’s G20 summit in Hamburg, I started to worry that Germany would fall short of these expectations.
But, if anything, Germany under-promised and over-delivered.
The lengthy communiqué issued at the end of the Hamburg summit includes a statement on AMR that is bolder than I would have expected.
Not only have G20 leaders reaffirmed their previous support for efforts by the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the Organization for Animal Health to tackle AMR.
They have also taken important steps in three crucial areas: agricultural usage, diagnostics, and the market for new useful drugs. There are clear opportunities for breakthrough commitments in each of these three areas.
In agriculture, G20 countries have promised to restrict the use of antibiotics outside of veterinary medicine.
That alone is a big step forward, given that, in big countries such as the United States, and possibly China and India, antibiotics are now used more for growth promotion in agriculture than for fighting infections in humans.
The European Union has prohibited this practice for a decade now, but its policy has not spread globally because vested interests in major food-producing countries have stood in the way.
Still, countries such as the US and Brazil could now have their own “Volvo moments”: policymakers simply need to tell food producers what will and will not be allowed.
The G20’s Harmony Without Trump
(Oh friends, not these sounds!), proclaimed the baritone in the stirring performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony to the G20 leaders in Hamburg last Friday evening.
That soul-stirring phrase, the opening line of “Ode to Joy,” Beethoven’s appeal to universal brotherhood, was the perfect message to the global leaders sitting in the concert hall’s balcony.
The G20 President, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, actually made remarkable headway in channeling Beethoven’s spirit.
This G20 summit, of course, was the first with Donald Trump as US President.
The summit’s discordant tones, echoed in the stormy sections of Beethoven’s symphony, emanated entirely from the United States.
Trump has no use for appeals to brotherly love.
He traffics in ethnic and religious divisiveness, hostility to neighbors (insisting again at the summit that the US will build a wall on the Mexican border and that Mexico will pay for it), and Manichean images of a Western civilization vulnerable to collapse at the hands of radical Islam, rather than at the height of unimaginable wealth and technological prowess.
While the conductor led the orchestra in a breathtaking performance, the true maestro of the evening was Merkel.
What a stroke of genius to bring the G20 leaders to Hamburg’s spectacular new Elbphilharmonie concert hall, itself a triumph of architectural vision, to be inspired by perhaps the greatest musical work of universal culture, with its message of world harmony.
The concert itself offered layer upon layer of significance.
The Germany of Beethoven has been reborn on the ashes of the Germany of Hitler.
Germany today is a globally admired, peace-loving, war-abhorring, democratic, prosperous, innovative, and cooperative country.
At the same time, Beethoven’s genius belongs not only to his native Germany, or even to the West, but to all of humanity.
His scoring of Schiller’s poetic ode reflects the truly global aspirations of the Enlightenment.
Yes, the Enlightenment was a European phenomenon; but it was utterly aware of the entire world and of the dangers of particularism and chauvinism.
In Germany, it was imbued with Immanuel Kant’s vision of “perpetual peace,” grounded in the “categorical imperative” to act according to maxims that can be made into a universal law, rather than according to personal whims and narrow self-interest.
Trump’s “America First” is a brazen affront to Kantian ethics and a threat to peace.
His break with the rest of the world on the Paris climate agreement is his most chilling act of naked self-interest so far.
Lessons from Germany for Integrating Refugees
DAVOS – Governments around the world are facing a huge challenge.
The number of international migrants has surged in recent years, reaching 244 million in 2015 – a 41% increase from 2000.
With that total including 20 million refugees, preventing a humanitarian nightmare demands swift and responsible integration into host societies.
The logistical challenge of doing so is placing mounting pressure on the countries facing the largest influxes.
Germany, which received about 1.1 million people in 2015, knows this pressure all too well.
Yet Germany has not buckled.
On the contrary, it has handled the pressure exceedingly well, proving that through sustained collaboration among governments, business, and civil society, countries can develop effective approaches to meeting the needs of refugees and the countries that receive them.
To succeed, each country must ensure that it has the capabilities, resources, and structures in place to manage refugees’ needs efficiently.
Sound management and coordination among transit and destination countries can enable governments, businesses, NGOs, and aid agencies to address more effectively the challenges that will inevitably arise along the way.
Fortunately, the needed cooperation and commitment seems to be emerging.
From my own vantage point in Germany, I’ve seen growing numbers of businesses seize the opportunity to tackle logistical and humanitarian challenges, offering services that help refugees rebuild their lives, while sharing the costs of infrastructure, technology, health care, training, education, and more.
In particular, about 100 German businesses, including some that are household names, have joined the Wir Zusammen (We Together) initiative, which aims to help integrate new arrivals.
To date, the initiative has secured internships for some 1,800 refugees and apprenticeships for another 300.
My own firm, PwC Germany, offers a free ten-week language and vocational training course for refugees when they first arrive – the most critical period for them.
Many refugees are prohibited from working during their first three months in a new host country, and lack access to public integration programs until their asylum application is approved.
Thanks to our initiative and others like it, refugees can use this time to prepare to enter the job market, by gaining valuable skills, not to mention a certified assessment of their occupational aptitude.
Such initiatives help not just the refugees, but also businesses – and, in turn, Germany’s economy.
Companies that are not afraid of language barriers and cultural differences early in the integration process are rewarded with the chance to train and hire people who are highly motivated and often highly skilled.
Will Europe Let Germany Lead?
BERLIN – The United Kingdom’s Brexit vote, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s referendum defeat and subsequent resignation, and Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States have created a power vacuum in the West, and in Europe.
At a time when Europe needs to make important collective economic and foreign-policy decisions, domestic issues are preoccupying larger European Union member states such as France, the UK, Spain, and Italy.
Consequently, there is growing pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government to step up and lead.
But while Germany wants to show leadership, it needs European partners who are willing to engage and compromise.
Germany’s critics are right to say that it could be more open to other member states’ policy proposals, but many of the complaints leveled against Germany have been unfair – and often self-serving.
For example, the German government has been accused of shunning European solidarity in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
But, while German measures have sometimes come too late, or been ill-conceived – such as its “temporary Grexit” proposal – Germany’s government has also agreed to numerous bailout programs, the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, and an EU banking union. What’s more, Germany has borne the largest financial burden.
Germany has also been criticized for not agreeing to underwrite Eurobonds, and for opposing a transfer union.
A third complaint made against Germany is that it engages in beggar-thy-neighbor behavior, by pursuing restrictive fiscal policies that have created an excessive current-account surplus of close to 9% of GDP.
This has indeed been a mistake.
But it is Germany’s problem, first and foremost.
While Germany has a large investment gap that hurts domestic productivity and growth, it is not the main culprit behind tepid growth, high unemployment, low competitiveness, and other economic ills elsewhere in Europe.
Admittedly, many German policymakers have been misguided in their obsession with fiscal austerity, and with their criticism of the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy approach.
But they are justifiably frustrated with the slow pace of economic reform across the EU.
Overall, Germans are deeply pro-European, and the German government has done more for Europe than it is given credit for.
Leadership mistakes are easy to identify and criticize in retrospect.
A more constructive exercise is to judge decisions in the context of the information that was available at the time they were made, and to apply past lessons to future choices.
Three Scenarios for the Global Economy
NEW YORK – For the last few years, the global economy has been oscillating between periods of acceleration (when growth is positive and strengthening) and periods of deceleration (when growth is positive but weakening).
After over a year of acceleration, is the world headed toward another slowdown, or will the recovery persist?
The current upswing in growth and equity markets has been going strong since the summer of 2016.
Despite a brief hiccup after the Brexit vote, the acceleration endured not just Donald Trump’s election as US president, but also the heightening policy uncertainty and geopolitical chaos that he has generated.
In response to this apparent resilience, the International Monetary Fund, which in recent years had characterized global growth as the “new mediocre,” recently upgraded its World Economic Outlook.
Will the recent growth spurt continue over the next few years?
Or is the world experiencing a temporary cyclical upswing that will soon be subdued by new tail risks, like those that have triggered other slowdowns in recent years? It is enough to recall the summer of 2015 and early 2016, when investor fears of a Chinese hard landing, an excessively fast exit from zero policy rates by the US Federal Reserve, a stall in US GDP growth, and low oil prices conspired to undercut growth.
One can envision three possible scenarios for the global economy in the next three years or so.
In the bullish scenario, the world’s four largest, systemically important economies – China, the eurozone, Japan, and the United States – implement structural reforms that boost potential growth and address financial vulnerabilities.
By ensuring that the cyclical upswing is associated with stronger potential and actual growth, such efforts would produce robust GDP growth, low but moderately rising inflation, and relative financial stability for many more years.
US and global equity markets would reach new heights, justified by stronger fundamentals.
In the bearish scenario, the opposite happens: the world’s major economies fail to implement structural reforms that boost potential growth.
Rather than using this month’s National Congress of the Communist Party as a catalyst for reform, China kicks the can down the road, continuing on a path of excessive leverage and overcapacity.
The eurozone fails to achieve greater integration, while political constraints limit national policymakers’ ability to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms.
And Japan remains stuck on its low-growth trajectory, as supply-side reforms and trade liberalization – the third “arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic strategy – fizzle out.
As for the US, the Trump administration, in this scenario, continues to pursue a policy approach – including a tax cut that overwhelmingly favors the rich, trade protectionism, and migration restrictions – that may well reduce potential growth.
Excessive fiscal stimulus leads to runaway deficits and debt, which results in higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, further weakening growth.
Trigger-happy Trump could even end up in a military conflict with North Korea – and, later, Iran – diminishing America’s economic prospects further.
In this scenario, the lack of reform in major economies will leave the cyclical upswing constrained by low trend growth.
How Fake News Wins
WASHINGTON, DC – In response to the wave of fake news that inundated the recent presidential election campaign in the United States, much attention has been devoted to those who produce or spread those stories.
The assumption is that if news outlets were to report only the “facts,” readers and viewers would always reach the right conclusion about a given story.
But this approach addresses only half of the equation.
Yes, we need news organizations to deliver reliable information; but we also need those receiving it to be savvy consumers.
For decades, the US government has supported programs to foster independent media in authoritarian, resource-deprived, or dysfunctional countries.
But these programs tacitly assume that the US itself is immune to the problems people in other countries encounter when they create or consume information.
We in the US also assume that American media, sustained by advertising, will continue to thrive; that independent journalism is the norm; and that most people are capable of thinking critically and making sound judgments about the information they receive.
In fact, some of the lessons that we have learned while supporting vibrant information gathering and distribution abroad are equally relevant to the US.
In the 2016 election, the personal beliefs that drove millions of voters’ decisions were based not only on each person’s experiences and the information they accessed, but also on how they processed those experiences and that information.
Voters’ own relationships with content producers, their motivation to believe or disbelieve facts, and their critical thinking skills all determined how they interpreted and acted on information.
Men and women talking in front of TV cameras are too far removed from the factories, offices, bars, churches, schools, and hospitals where viewers form the relationships that determine how they process information.
The so-called digital revolution did not render superfluous the importance of human connection in shaping people’s interpretation and response to the information they receive.
Relationships are built on trust, which is essential for ensuring that consumers accept information that challenges their closely held beliefs.
But, according to Gallup, only 32% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in traditional media outlets – an all-time low.
That is deeply problematic, and it suggests that many citizens are throwing out the good information with the bad.
As with any other good, how information is consumed reflects economic and political opportunities, personal incentives, and institutional or cultural norms.
Workers in Ohio whose wages have stagnated, or unemployed voters in Michigan whose jobs have migrated overseas, will consume information in a way that reflects their economic situation.
Not surprisingly, they will often select sources – whether credible or not – that are critical of globalization and current fiscal and economic policies.
Illiberal Stagnation
NEW YORK – Today, a quarter-century after the Cold War’s end, the West and Russia are again at odds.
This time, though, at least on one side, the dispute is more transparently about geopolitical power, not ideology.
The West has supported in a variety of ways democratic movements in the post-Soviet region, hardly hiding its enthusiasm for the various “color” revolutions that have replaced long-standing dictators with more responsive leaders – though not all have turned out to be the committed democrats they pretended to be.
Too many countries of the former Soviet bloc remain under the control of authoritarian leaders, including some, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have learned how to maintain a more convincing façade of elections than their communist predecessors.
They sell their system of “illiberal democracy” on the basis of pragmatism, not some universal theory of history.
These leaders claim that they are simply more effective at getting things done.
That is certainly true when it comes to stirring nationalist sentiment and stifling dissent.
They have been less effective, however, in nurturing long-term economic growth.
Once one of the world’s two superpowers, Russia’s GDP is now about 40% of Germany’s and just over 50% of France’s.
Life expectancy at birth ranks 153rd in the world, just behind Honduras and Kazakhstan.
In terms of per capita income, Russia now ranks 73rd (in terms of purchasing power parity) – well below the Soviet Union’s former satellites in Central and Eastern Europe.
The country has deindustrialized: the vast majority of its exports now come from natural resources.
It has not evolved into a “normal” market economy, but rather into a peculiar form of crony-state capitalism.
Yes, Russia still punches above its weight in some areas, like nuclear weapons.
And it retains veto power at the United Nations.
As the recent hacking of the Democratic Party in the United States shows, it has cyber capacities that enable it to be enormously meddlesome in Western elections.
There is every reason to believe that such intrusions will continue.
Given US President Donald Trump’s deep ties with unsavory Russian characters (themselves closely linked to Putin), Americans are deeply concerned about potential Russian influences in the US – matters that may be clarified by ongoing investigations.
Many had much higher hopes for Russia, and the former Soviet Union more broadly, when the Iron Curtain fell.
An IMF Bridge to Somewhere for Greece?
ZURICH – The International Monetary Fund has resurrected an old technique – commonly used in the 1980s during the Latin American debt crisis – that would allow Greece to avoid a payment default next month on debt owed to European creditors.
The reprieve also gives the IMF and its European partners time to sort out their technical differences on the struggling country’s growth and budget outlook.
But the Fund’s elegant compromise still leaves Greece under the shadow of an enormous debt overhang; reducing it requires that Europe find a way to set aside national politics and act on the basis of economic logic and necessity.
Europe and the IMF have been unable to reconcile two views of Greece’s debt sustainability, with the two sides’ differences spilling over into the public domain.
Guided mainly by a cash-flow analysis, European authorities argue that low interest rates and long maturities have made the nation’s debt sustainable.
But the Fund notes that, at almost 200% of GDP, Greece’s stock of debt deters investment and capital inflows.
For the IMF, meaningful debt reduction is critical for generating the confidence and credibility needed to break Greece out of a prolonged period of impoverishment.
This is not the only area of disagreement between Greece’s two major creditors.
They also differ on the realism of some key economic projections, including the important nexus between growth and the government budget, with Europe adopting a much more optimistic perspective.
For those of us who have been following the Greek economic tragedy for many years, much of the European view continues to defy economic logic – and for a simple reason: European politicians worry about the domestic political consequences of granting Greece debt relief, especially ahead of Germany’s federal election in September.
Offering debt relief, it is feared, could undermine the credibility of governing parties and provide a boost to extremist movements.
To be sure, debt forgiveness is tricky, raising complicated issues of fairness and incentives.
Yet, in some cases, there comes a time when refusal to forgive debt is more damaging.
European officials know as well as the IMF does that Greece has long been at this stage, turning the country into a permanent “ward of the state” within a eurozone that does not accommodate this outcome well.
But they seem unable to act.
With Europe and the IMF failing to agree, Greece has been robbed of the additional funding it needs to clear domestic arrears and meet its rather large external debt-service payments in July.
Meanwhile, growth is languishing once again, despite the pickup in European economic performance as a whole.
To overcome this bottleneck, the IMF has compromised, by reviving the practice of approving a financing program “in principle.”
An approval in principle signals the Fund’s endorsement of a country’s economic policy intentions.
The Limits of Economic Optimism
WASHINGTON, DC – As the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund commence, the world’s economic future appears brighter than it has in some time.
The international financial institutions, not to mention many private-sector actors, are projecting significantly faster growth this year than in 2016.
Is their buoyant outlook warranted?
Until recently, most macroeconomic indicators were regularly leading to downgrades in growth projections.
Now, the opposite seems to be happening.
The IMF’s recent flagship report raised its projection for world GDP growth for 2017 from 3.4% to 3.5%, compared to the estimated rate of 3.1% for 2016.
Likewise, the multi-indicator Brookings – FT TIGER Index points to a “broad-based and stable” recovery.
According to these projections – which are based on models, new data, and the judgment of the particular institution or forecaster – the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are contributing the most to the uptick in growth.
India is also doing particularly well.
Deciphering these projections’ various components – from the new information to the forecasters’ hypotheses – would be a huge task.
But, whatever reasons for optimism forecasters may have, there are also strong grounds for caution, especially in the medium and long term.
Forecasters, like markets, are often influenced by “herd instinct.”
The greater the number of analysts who subscribe to a particular view, the more likely it is that additional analysts will shift their own forecasts in that direction.
In this case, the majority’s rather optimistic view has been buttressed by a broad sense of relief.
Both the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump as US president raised fears of economic disaster.
Yet, so far, neither development has had particularly dire economic consequences.
On the contrary, market confidence remains high, boosting expectations of increased investment and consumption.
It is telling that the US Federal Reserve has now pursued modest interest-rate hikes without triggering an adverse reaction even in emerging markets, which last year were dreading such a move.
Against this background, economic optimism makes some sense.
The Migrant Boon
OXFORD/SHANGHAI – Many of the immigration debates now raging around the world reflect the faulty assumption that admitting immigrants is an act of largesse – and a costly one, at that.
But, far from being an economic burden, immigrants represent a major economic opportunity for destination countries.
Those countries that take a thoughtful, long-term approach to immigration can capture large and tangible benefits.
New research from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows that cross-border migrants – more than 90% of whom have moved for economic reasons – comprise just 3.4% of the world’s population, but contribute nearly 10% of global GDP.
Because roughly two-thirds of these migrants reside in developed countries, where productivity tends to be highest, they are maximizing the impact of their work, with far-reaching economic benefits.
Migrants of all skill levels contribute to this effect.
Migrants added roughly $6.7 trillion to global GDP in 2015 – some $3 trillion more than they are projected to have produced had they stayed in their countries of origin.
Because flows from developing to developed countries generate the largest productivity increases, these destinations account for more than 90% of migrants’ total contribution to global GDP.
MGI estimates that, in 2015, immigrants generated some $2 trillion in the United States, $550 billion in Germany, $390 billion in the United Kingdom, $330 billion in Australia, and $320 billion in Canada.
Even those estimates are probably too modest, given that immigrants are also an important source of innovation and entrepreneurship.
They can play a particularly important role in countries with rapidly aging populations, as they support much-needed labor-force growth, improve old-age dependency ratios, and contribute tax revenues.
Contrary to popular belief, immigrants typically do not take jobs that would otherwise be filled by native-born workers.
Many gain a foothold in a new community by taking jobs that are available precisely because locals do not want them.
A large body of research shows that immigrants have a negligible negative impact on the wages and employment of native-born workers, not to mention on the fiscal resources of destination countries.
Yet studies also suggest that, in Europe and North America, immigrants may earn 20-30% less than native-born workers of similar education levels, even within the same occupations.
With immigrants less able to negotiate wages effectively – owing to, say, language barriers or unrecognized credentials – countries end up with a two-track job market.
This inequality extends beyond economics.
Multilateralism Is the Only Way Forward
PARIS – International cooperation is under strain.
The voices of protectionism and nationalism are gaining strength, and governments are increasingly pursuing policy goals through unilateral or ad hoc measures, rather than by working together.
The automatic exchange of financial information based on the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard has allowed governments to collect close to €85 billion ($99 billion) in additional tax revenue worldwide; this money can help fund better social policies.
These are just a sample of the benefits that multilateral institutions deliver for modern societies.
But the value of multilateralism itself transcends any particular program or policy.
The international system and its institutions were created as a bulwark against war.
After helping Europe recover from the ruins of World War II, multilateralism gave countries a common purpose: to improve their citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life.
Beyond any economic metric, we should measure the success of multilateralism in wars not fought and lives not lost.
Yet ever more people are losing confidence that international cooperation can solve today’s problems.
While deepening interconnections among the world’s economies have fueled growth, lifted millions out of poverty, and raised living standards, the benefits have not been sufficiently shared.
If multilateralism is not delivering all that we want, the solution is not to give up on it.
Rather, we must make it deliver results for the modern day.
Given the magnitude of the world’s challenges, no country will get far going it alone – or even bilaterally.
It is only in multilateral settings that we will find solutions for today’s complex challenges.
Multilateral cooperation provides venues to resolve differences peacefully; platforms to agree on common rules of the game; mechanisms to better manage international flows; and channels for exchanging ideas, experiences, and practices so that countries learn from each other.
Global cooperation and integration have been critical to the impressive expansion of wellbeing and opportunities that we have witnessed over the past 70 years.
This week, ministers from OECD countries will convene in Paris under the chairmanship of French President Emmanuel Macron.
Demonetization Dos and Don’ts
CAMBRIDGE – On November 8, at 8:15 in the evening, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced that, at the stroke of midnight, all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes in circulation would no longer be considered legal tender, and would need to be exchanged for new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes. Modi’s “demonetization” intervention affected 85% of the money in circulation in India.
It was an unprecedented move, whether in India or almost anywhere else, and it is by far Modi’s boldest policy intervention to date.
The Modi government is targeting the “black money” associated with tax evasion, corruption, and counterfeiting, and thus the drug traffickers, smugglers, and terrorists who engage in those activities.
India’s tax-paying salaried classes and even the poor initially welcomed the policy enthusiastically, viewing it as sweet revenge against tax evaders who had stowed away their ill-gotten gains; they reveled in anecdotes of corrupt officials burning bags of cash or throwing money into India’s rivers.
But with each passing day, that initial cheer diminishes.
Public frustration is now mounting, because the government has failed to meet the demand for new printed notes.
Commerce in India – where the cash-to-GDP ratio is 10% – relies heavily on cash transactions, and informal-economy and small-business operations have now ground to a halt, owing to long lines and tight cash-withdrawal limits at banks and shortages at ATMs.
The near-term impact will be the equivalent of an “anti-stimulus” policy intervention, and the consequent drag on demand will be significant.
Moreover, as real-estate prices decline, so, too, will household wealth.
Although lower house prices will make new homes more affordable, the stock of occupied homes will far exceed new purchases in the near term, so the negative-wealth effect will overwhelm the gains.
Given these large upfront costs, it is reasonable to ask how effective demonetization is in fighting tax evasion and corruption, and if there is a less costly approach to demonetization.
Back in 1976, in an article entitled “How to Make the Mob Miserable,” the American economist James S. Henry addressed the question of effectiveness, prescribing demonetization as a measure to undermine mafia operations.
But policymakers did not take his proposal seriously.
Henry’s proposal was, in his own words, “dismissed as either administratively impractical or as a one-shot action that would have no long-run impact on criminal behavior.”
In a new book, The Curse of Cash, Kenneth Rogoff champions the elimination of high-denomination notes in order to fight tax evasion and criminal activity. Rogoff furnishes extensive evidence that making it costly to hoard cash would deter illegal activities.
While tax evaders also store their wealth in non-monetary forms, such as land, art, and jewelry, cash remains a leading vehicle for ill-gotten gains, owing to its inherent liquidity.
That said, Rogoff proposes a different strategy to address the menace of black money – one that would be minimally disruptive and arguably more effective, at least in the long run.
That strategy would depart from the Modi government’s intervention in two fundamental ways.
Intellectual Property for the Twenty-First-Century Economy
NEW YORK – When the South African government attempted to amend its laws in 1997 to avail itself of affordable generic medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, the full legal might of the global pharmaceutical industry bore down on the country, delaying implementation and exacting a human cost.
South Africa eventually won its case, but the government learned its lesson: it did not try again to put its citizens’ health and wellbeing into its own hands by challenging the conventional global intellectual property (IP) regime.
The South African cabinet is preparing to finalize an IP policy that promises to expand access to medicines substantially.
South Africa will now undoubtedly face all manner of bilateral and multilateral pressure from wealthy countries.
But the government is right, and other developing and emerging economies should follow in its footsteps.
Over the last two decades, there has been serious pushback from the developing world against the current IP regime.
In large part, this is because wealthy countries have sought to impose a one-size-fits-all model on the world, by influencing the rulemaking process at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and forcing their will via trade agreements.
The IP standards advanced countries favor typically are designed not to maximize innovation and scientific progress, but to maximize the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and others able to sway trade negotiations.
No surprise, then, that large developing countries with substantial industrial bases – such as South Africa, India, and Brazil – are leading the counterattack.
These countries are fully justified in opposing an IP regime that is neither equitable nor efficient.
In a new paper, we review the arguments about the role of intellectual property in the process of development.
We show that the preponderance of theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that the economic institutions and laws protecting knowledge in today’s advanced economies are increasingly inadequate to govern global economic activity, and are poorly suited to meet the needs of developing countries and emerging markets.
Indeed, they are inimical to providing for basic human needs such as adequate health care.
The central problem is that knowledge is a (global) public good, both in the technical sense that the marginal cost of someone using it is zero, and in the more general sense that an increase in knowledge can improve wellbeing globally.
Given this, the worry has been that the market will undersupply knowledge, and research will not be adequately incentivized.
The Stakes of Italy’s Referendum
MILAN – In the last 68 years, Italy has held 17 general elections and a few referenda.
But only three times has an Italian vote claimed center stage internationally: in 1948, when the choice was between the West and communism; in 1976, when voters faced a similar choice, between the Christian Democrats and Enrico Berlinguer’s “Eurocommunism”; and now, with the upcoming referendum on constitutional reforms.
The implications of the upcoming vote are enormous.
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future on the vote, pledging to step down (though not immediately) if the reforms are rejected.
Such an outcome that would irreparably weaken the center-left government coalition as well: Renzi’s Democratic Party (PD) is already roiled by infighting over the reforms.
In fact, the PD may not be able to avoid a split even if the vote goes the prime minister’s way.
A defeat for Renzi will be read as a victory for Italy’s two major populist parties: the Lega Nord and the larger Five Star Movement, led by the comedian Beppe Grillo.
The two parties are not allied, but both are nurtured by anti-establishment sentiment and favor “national solutions” to Italy’s problems – beginning with a return to the Italian lira.
If Renzi is defeated, Lega Nord and the Five Star Movement could join forces to support a new government and hold a new referendum – this time on the euro.
If Italy – one of the world’s largest public debtors – decided to go it alone, the entire European project could be dealt a mortal blow.
In the age of Donald Trump and Brexit, that outcome is far from unthinkable.
The issue at stake in the referendum is not inconsequential, but it should not decide the fate of Europe.
Italians will vote on whether to strip the Senate (the parliament’s upper house) of two-thirds of its members and much of its legislative authority, making it merely a talking shop akin to Germany’s Bundesrat, and return some of the regions’ powers to the central government.
Changes like these have been discussed for 30 years. The lack of movement could benefit Renzi, if voters conclude that they should not waste such a rare opportunity to do something to reform their sclerotic system.
President Sergio Mattarella is impartial, but he would prefer that the reforms go forward.
His predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano, is also strongly in favor of the reforms, which he says would be “great news for Italy.”
But the reforms have also faced stiff opposition.
Some state institutions dislike the idea of delivering more powers to the executive branch; magistrates, for example, fear a loss of judges’ extensive and unchecked powers.
Then there are the new populists, several PD old-timers, and plenty of other establishment figures, including several former members of the constitutional court, who generally fear change.
CAMBRIDGE – This month the European Union will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community.
There certainly is much to celebrate.
After centuries of war, upheaval, and mass killings, Europe is peaceful and democratic.
The EU has brought 11 former Soviet-bloc countries into its fold, successfully guiding their post-communist transitions.
And, in an age of inequality, EU member countries exhibit the lowest income gaps anywhere in the world.
But these are past achievements.
The symptoms are everywhere: Brexit, crushing levels of youth unemployment in Greece and Spain, debt and stagnation in Italy, the rise of populist movements, and a backlash against immigrants and the euro.
They all point to the need for a major overhaul of Europe’s institutions.
So a new white paper on the future of Europe by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker comes none too soon.
Juncker sets out five possible paths: carrying on with the current agenda, focusing just on the single market, allowing some countries to move faster than others toward integration, narrowing down the agenda, and pushing ambitiously for uniform and more complete integration.
It’s hard not to feel sympathy for Juncker.
With Europe’s politicians preoccupied with their domestic battles and the EU institutions in Brussels a target for popular frustration, he could stick his neck out only so far.
Still, his report is disappointing.
It sidesteps the central challenge that the EU must confront and overcome.
If European democracies are to regain their health, economic and political integration cannot remain out of sync.
Either political integration catches up with economic integration, or economic integration needs to be scaled back.
As long as this decision is evaded, the EU will remain dysfunctional.
When confronted with this stark choice, member states are likely to end up in different positions along the continuum of economic-political integration.
Toward a People-Centered ASEAN Community
SEOUL – I am delighted that my first meeting with the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comes at a historic moment: the 50th anniversary of ASEAN’s founding.
During those 50 years, not only my country, the Republic of Korea, but almost all of Asia has been utterly transformed.
ASEAN’s role in harnessing and spreading economic dynamism has been essential to the region’s success.
For Korea, ASEAN has undoubtedly been a special and valued friend.
Last year alone, some six million Koreans visited ASEAN member states, both as tourists and for business.
Approximately 500,000 citizens of ASEAN member states now live and work in Korea, while roughly 300,000 Koreans live and work in ASEAN countries.
This is one example of why Korea’s ties with ASEAN are more than just intergovernmental relations.
Our relationship is deepened in the most personal way possible, through the intertwining of so many individuals’ lives.
This fact should not surprise anyone.
ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together, which was endorsed by ASEAN leaders at their 27th Summit in November 2015, states that the group strives to be a “people-centered, people-oriented community” that seeks to build a caring and sharing society which is inclusive and where the well-being, livelihood, and welfare of the people are enhanced.
“People first” has been my longstanding political philosophy as well, and it is a vision in line with the spirit of Korea’s “candlelight revolution” that lit and heated up the winter in Korea a year ago.
Korea and ASEAN share a common philosophy that values people, and that shared outlook will set the path that Korea and ASEAN take together in the years and decades ahead.
Since 2010, Korea and ASEAN have made significant strides together as strategic partners.
Korea-ASEAN cooperation so far, however, has remained focused mainly on government-led collaboration in political, security, and economic affairs.
I intend to help advance Korea-ASEAN relations while placing a high priority on the “people” – both Koreans and the people of ASEAN.
My vision is to create, in cooperation with ASEAN, a “peace-loving, people-centered community where all members are better off together.”
This can be summed up in “three Ps”: People, Prosperity, and Peace.
To realize this vision, I will pursue “people-centered diplomacy.”
So, from this point onward, cooperation between Korea and ASEAN will be developed in a way that respects public opinion among all of the peoples of our association, gains their support, and invites their hands-on participation.
Global Citizens, National Shirkers
CAMBRIDGE – Last October, British Prime Minister Theresa May shocked many when she disparaged the idea of global citizenship.
“If you believe you’re a citizen of the world,” she said, “you’re a citizen of nowhere.”
Her statement was met with derision and alarm in the financial media and among liberal commentators.
“The most useful form of citizenship these days,” one analyst lectured her, “is one dedicated not only to the wellbeing of a Berkshire parish, say, but to the planet.”
The Economist called it an “illiberal” turn.
A scholar accused her of repudiating Enlightenment values and warned of “echoes of 1933” in her speech.
I know what a “global citizen” looks like: I see a perfect specimen every time I pass a mirror.
I grew up in one country, live in another, and carry the passports of both.
I write on global economics, and my work takes me to far-flung places.
I spend more time traveling in other countries than I do within either country that claims me as a citizen.
Most of my close colleagues at work are similarly foreign-born.
I devour international news, while my local paper remains unopened most weeks.
In sports, I have no clue how my home teams are doing, but I am a devoted fan of a football team on the other side of the Atlantic.
And yet May’s statement strikes a chord.
It contains an essential truth – the disregard of which says much about how we – the world’s financial, political, and technocratic elite – distanced ourselves from our compatriots and lost their trust.
Start first with the actual meaning of the word “citizen.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as “a legally recognized subject or national of a state or commonwealth.”
Hence citizenship presumes an established polity – “a state or commonwealth” – of which one is a member.
Countries have such polities; the world does not.
Proponents of global citizenship quickly concede that they do not have a literal meaning in mind. They are thinking figuratively.
Lessons from the Anti-Globalists
NEW YORK – The likely victory of Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election has elicited a global sigh of relief.
At least Europe is not going down the protectionist path that President Donald Trump is forcing the United States to take.
But advocates of globalization should keep the champagne on ice: protectionists and advocates of “illiberal democracy” are on the rise in many other countries.
And the fact that an open bigot and habitual liar could get as many votes as Trump did in the US, and that the far-right Marine Le Pen will be in the run-off vote with Macron on May 7, should be deeply worrying.
Some assume that Trump’s poor management and obvious incompetence should be enough to dent enthusiasm for populist nostrums elsewhere.
Likewise, the US Rust Belt voters who supported Trump will almost certainly be worse off in four years, and rational voters surely will understand this.
But it would be a mistake to conclude that discontent with the global economy – at least how it treats large numbers of those in (or formerly in) the middle class – has crested.
If the developed liberal democracies maintain status quo policies, displaced workers will continue to be alienated.
Many will feel that at least Trump, Le Pen, and their ilk profess to feel their pain.
Advocates of liberal market economies need to grasp that many reforms and technological advances may leave some groups – possibly large groups – worse off.
In principle, these changes increase economic efficiency, enabling the winners to compensate the losers.
But if the losers remain worse off, why should they support globalization and pro-market policies?
Indeed, it is in their self-interest to turn to politicians who oppose these changes.
So the lesson should be obvious: In the absence of progressive policies, including strong social-welfare programs, job retraining, and other forms of assistance for individuals and communities left behind by globalization, Trumpian politicians may become a permanent feature of the landscape.
The costs imposed by such politicians are high for all of us, even if they do not fully achieve their protectionist and nativist ambitions, because they prey on fear, inflame bigotry, and thrive on a dangerously polarized us-versus-them approach to governance.
Trump has leveled his Twitter attacks against Mexico, China, Germany, Canada, and many others – and the list is sure to grow the longer he is in office.
Le Pen has targeted Muslims, but her recent comments denying French responsibility for rounding up Jews during World War II revealed her lingering anti-Semitism.
Deep and perhaps irreparable national cleavages may be the result.
Macron’s Mission
PRINCETON – The centrist Emmanuel Macron’s success in the first round of the French presidential election is likely to re-energize Europe.
Unlike the other candidates, Macron does not just recognize the need for radical change to the European Union; he supports bringing it through Europe-wide cooperation.
But Macron’s plurality of the popular vote was narrow, and a much larger share of French voters showed support for a very different political vision.
It is a vision of nostalgia and isolation espoused by Macron’s rival in the second round, the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen.
Her slogan – “on est chez nous” (we are at home) – underscores her focus on enclosing France in a national cocoon that resists “wild globalization.”
But Le Pen was not alone in promoting this vision.
One of the candidates who finished fourth, the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, also built his candidacy on simplistic economic populism.
For example, like Le Pen, he promised a radical reduction in the retirement age, without explaining how to finance it.
And both appealed to Germanophobia, focusing on the European debt crisis and Germany’s insistence on austerity.
Le Pen accuses Macron of aspiring to be Vice-Chancellor of Europe, under German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while proudly declaring herself to be the “anti-Merkel.”
Mélenchon claims that Germany is motivated by radical individualism, neoliberalism, and the economic interests of an aging population.
Even if Macron wins the second round, as expected, he will have to address what drove more than 40% of French voters to support this anti-European vision in the first round. And if he is to reinvigorate support for Europe, he should consider what made Europe attractive in the past – and how it lost its allure.
When Europe was most obviously attractive, it was regarded as a way of purging what was bad and corrupt from national traditions.
In the 1950s, as two very old men, German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French President Charles de Gaulle, moved to reinvent their respective countries, they examined how their vaunted traditions had been undermined by their own elites.
Germany had been devastated by Nazism, which, in Adenauer’s view, had been forced on the country by Prussian aristocrats and militarists.
In France, according to de Gaulle, the elites weakened the country, before voting to overthrow the Republic in the aftermath of military defeat.
But, unlike today, the post-war anti-elite backlash did not cause countries to turn inward.
On the contrary, de Gaulle believed that France’s deep historical wounds could be healed only through engagement with Germany.
As he put it, “Germany is a great people that triumphed, and then was crushed.
Macron’s Labor Gambit
CAMBRIDGE –At the end of August, French president Emmanuel Macron unveiled the labor-market overhaul that will make or break his presidency – and may well determine the future of the eurozone.
His goal is to bring down France’s stubbornly high rate of unemployment, just a shade below 10%, and energize an economy that badly needs a kick-start.
Labor reform has long been on France’s agenda.
Practically every French administration in recent memory has tried to rewrite the country’s gargantuan labor code, typically failing in the face of trade union protests.
Macron makes no bones about what he is up against: he has described it as a Copernican revolution.
But this time may well be different.
Even though the country’s second-largest union has called a general strike, indications are that Macron will have the political support he needs.
Macron’s reforms aim at increasing what is euphemistically called labor-market flexibility.
The proposed reforms would make it easier for firms to dismiss employees, decentralize bargaining between employers and workers in small firms (by eliminating sector-level agreements), and introduce a ceiling on indemnity for wrongful dismissal, providing firms relief from the unpredictability of damages awarded through arbitration.
Moreover, the reforms remove a requirement that linked mass layoffs at large companies to such firms’ global profitability; companies will now be permitted to fire workers solely on the basis of domestic profitability.
The logic behind Macron’s labor-market reforms has driven the structural-reform agenda of policy economists and international institutions ranging from the International Monetary Fund to the OECD during the last three decades.
Greater flexibility, according to this view, will enable French firms to adjust more efficiently to changing market conditions, which in turn will make them more competitive and dynamic, giving the French economy a boost.
Firing costs are hiring costs, as economists like to say. Reduce firing costs, and you reduce hiring costs, too.
Whether a reduction in firing costs does boost employment depends on the balance of those two offsetting factors.
The outcome turns on whether firms are more constrained by the hiring costs or by the firing costs.
In good times, when firms want to expand, it is the hiring costs that bind, and making it easier to fire workers will remove a key impediment to investment and capacity expansion.
In more pessimistic times, reducing firing costs will simply lead to more dismissals.
Macron the Maverick
WASHINGTON, DC – Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front, may be a charter member of what New America Senior Fellow Scott Malcomson calls the “Nationalist International.”
But she is not the only “maverick” who is polling well in the run-up to her country’s presidential election this spring.
Emmanuel Macron is also a maverick, but of a very different type.
After serving as Minister of the Economy, Industry, and Digital Affairs under French President François Hollande, he launched his own political movement, En Marche!, and is running for president as an independent.
Macron is only 39, and has never been a party politician.
As recently as three months ago, few observers gave him a chance.
But he quickly assembled a strong team, and has rallied support among younger voters.
Macron has been polling around 20% for the election’s first round in April.
That appears insufficient to advance to the election’s second round in May, when the top two candidates will face off to determine the winner.
The first-round front-runners have been Le Pen, hovering at around 27% in the polls, and François Fillon, who served as Prime Minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy.
But Fillon’s candidacy is now in doubt, following allegations that he employed his wife and children in fictitious positions while serving in the National Assembly.
Meanwhile, left-wing candidate Benoît Hamon has surged in the polls since winning the Socialist Party primary, and is now approaching 20%.
Although Macron has positioned himself against the old left and the old right, he is neither a left- or right-wing populist, nor a traditional centrist.
He hails from the left emotionally and intellectually, but he rejects traditional “class politics.”
Macron is campaigning for votes from all parts of society.
He has reached out to workers who feel betrayed by the “system” and threatened by globalization and new technologies; and to teachers and health-care professionals who recognize that public education and health-care services need deep reforms to sustain the social solidarity that they underpinned in the past.
But he is also seeking support from innovators and entrepreneurs, who want a freer regulatory environment and improved access to resources.
He has not yet formulated a full program.
A Cautionary Tale for Media Regulators
QUITO – To understand the possible consequences of US President Donald Trump’s constant denunciations of the press, one need look no further than Ecuador, where former President Rafael Correa’s government attacked the news media for years.
During his 2007-2017 presidency, Correa implemented a raft of measures aimed at stifling press freedom.
And, like Trump, he regularly used the media as a whipping boy to rally his supporters.
In 2015, Correa managed to pass a constitutional amendment re-categorizing communications as a public service, like water or electricity, thereby allowing for more state control over speech.
And with the stated goal of ensuring “balanced media coverage,” he pushed through the 2013 Ecuadorian Communication Law, and enacted additional regulations allowing the government to crack down on journalists with fines, forced public apologies, and even prison sentences.
Like Trump, Correa would sometimes go on television or radio programs to denounce journalists by name; and his government repeatedly took news organizations to court.
For example, Correa brought an $80 million lawsuit against El Universo, one of the country’s major newspapers.
In the end, the paper was forced to pay $40 million in exchange for a “pardon.”
With the spread of disinformation online fueling distrust of the media and other institutions, regulations to police some kinds of speech may seem like a good idea.
Clearly, major distribution platforms like Facebook need to be more heavily regulated.
But, in some cases, laws enacted in the “public interest” can actually work against it.
And at the same time, laws meant to support legitimate journalism usually offer only scant protection against those who are determined to act in bad faith.
I learned this first-hand when I accompanied a group from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on a recent trip to Ecuador.
From speaking to Ecuadorian journalists, it is clear that most of Correa’s media policies and enforcement practices crossed the line into outright censorship.
News outlets that did not provide ample coverage of government statements were fined, as were outlets that did not recirculate foreign press reports that were favorable to the government or critical of opposition figures.
On some occasions, news outlets were even forced to print or air lengthy dissenting statements from government officials who disliked their treatment in the media.
Ecuador’s experience shows how laws that seem reasonable on paper – such as those guaranteeing subjects of news stories a “right to reply” – can easily be abused.
According to Ecuadorian journalists, government officials often refuse to speak to reporters because they know that, should a story about them appear, they can simply force the outlet to publish a long, unedited statement of their own.
And though news outlets may appeal in “right to reply” cases, doing so can lead to lengthy and costly lawsuits.
The Mexican Paradox
CAMBRIDGE – Few economies pose as big a paradox as Mexico’s.
Emerging from a series of macroeconomic crises in the mid-1990s, Mexico undertook bold reforms that should have put it on track for rapid economic growth.
It embraced macroeconomic prudence, liberalized its economic policies, signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), invested in education, and implemented innovative policies to combat poverty.
In many respects, these reforms paid off.
Macroeconomic stability was achieved, domestic investment rose by two percentage points of GDP, and average educational attainment increased by nearly three years.
Perhaps the most visible gains were on the external front.
Exports jumped from 5% to 30% of GDP, and the GDP share of inward foreign direct investment tripled.
But where it counts – in overall productivity and economic growth – the story is one of substantial disappointment.
Since 1996, per capita economic growth has averaged well below 1.5%, and total factor productivity has stagnated or declined.
If ever there was a country that was destined to be the poster child of the new orthodoxy in economic development, it was Mexico.
Instead, the country fell behind even its Latin American peers.
Why?
A large part of the answer has to do with the Mexican economy’s extreme dualism – a problem that has been called the “two Mexicos.”
The bulk of Mexican workers remain employed in “informal” firms – especially firms in which employees are not on salaried contracts – where productivity is a fraction of the level in large, modern firms that are integrated into the world economy.
What is striking is that this dualism has worsened during the period of Mexico’s liberalizing reforms.
Research by one of us (Levy) shows that informal firms have absorbed a growing share of the economy’s resources.
The cumulative growth of employment between 1998 and 2013 in the informal sector was a whopping 115%, compared to 6% in the formal economy.
For capital, cumulative growth was 134% for the informal sector and 9% for the formal sector.
Mexico does not seem to lack economic dynamism.
Mexico Gets Its Own Trump
MEXICO CITY – US President Donald Trump has been the world’s worst headache for the past 18 months, and arguably no country has suffered more than Mexico.
Of the three main contenders in Mexico’s just-completed presidential election, none was as ill-prepared as the winner, Andrés Manuel López Obrador – AMLO, as he is known – to manage the bully in the White House.
Nonetheless, the Mexican people have chosen him, and he will have to deal with Trump for much (if not all) of his six years in office.
Mexico’s relations with the United States were not a central campaign topic, nor will they figure among AMLO’s priorities.
But they will surely affect Mexicans more than most other issues.
Both appear to be sincere economic nationalists: Trump hopes to make the US self-sufficient in aluminum and steel, while AMLO seeks the same for Mexico in corn, wheat, beef, pork, and lumber. Both disapprove of trade treaties, although they temper their aversion with pragmatic selectivity: Trump left the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but not the North American Free Trade Agreement (for now), while AMLO says he will continue to re-negotiate NAFTA with the US and Canada along the lines pursued by the current president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Each man profoundly dislikes the other’s country and panders to their nationalist supporters, who occasionally take their deep-rooted passions to extremes.
But both know that they must negotiate, accommodate, and conciliate on-the-ground realities.
Despite these resemblances – or precisely because of them – Trump and AMLO are almost certain to plunge US-Mexican relations to new depths of suspicion and strain, as objective factors and subjective fervors aggravate old tensions and fuel new ones.
Trade, immigration, drugs, security, and regional issues will continue to dominate the bilateral agenda, and on all these fronts, AMLO will face the most adversarial US president in nearly a century.
On trade and tariffs, while AMLO’s specific stances are unknown, many of his economic proposals contradict the letter or the spirit of NAFTA.
Establishing floor prices for many agricultural products, and ensuring that Mexico produces what it consumes, runs counter to many NAFTA provisions – and to Trump’s goal of reducing the bilateral US trade deficit.
Even in the best case, however, the changing of the guard will delay any final agreement and ratification by the three countries. In the meantime, Trump’s constant threats to withdraw from NAFTA or impose new tariffs – for example, on Mexican automobile exports to the US – will inevitably irritate Mexico’s new leaders.
Trump’s insistence on building a wall along the entire border, the rising number of Mexicans deported from the US heartland, Central American migrants crossing Mexico, separate detention of immigrant children, and Trump’s diplomatic and rhetorical pressure on all these fronts will not make things easier. Peña Nieto’s kowtowing to the US on most of these matters, ever since he invited then-candidate Trump to Mexico City at the height of the presidential campaign, will logically lead AMLO to distinguish himself as much as possible by standing up to Trump as often as he can, if only symbolically.
Peña Nieto warned that he would use immigration and security as bargaining chips in pursuit of a holistic approach to all issues on the bilateral agenda.
Moon’s South Korean Ostpolitik
SEOUL – Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea has just been elected South Korea’s new president. This is the second conservative-to-liberal transition of power in the country’s democratic history.
It began unexpectedly last October, with the eruption of a corruption scandal involving then-President Park Geun-hye, culminating in her impeachment and removal from office earlier this year.
To understand what kind of policy he will pursue requires familiarity with liberal foreign-policy thinking in South Korea since the 1998-2003 presidency of Kim Dae-jung.
Kim had watched the Cold War come to a peaceful end in Europe, and he wanted to bring his own country’s ongoing confrontation with the communist North to a similarly nonviolent conclusion.
So he pursued direct engagement with North Korea, and his “Sunshine Policy” was taken up by his successor, Roh Moo-hyun.
Before he died in 2009, Roh (under whom I served as Foreign Minister) was a political mentor and close friend to Moon.
German reunification, preceded by West Germany’s policy of direct engagement, or Ostpolitik, with East Germany in the last decades of the Cold War, was a source of profound inspiration for Kim.
Former German Chancellor Willy Brandt began pursuing Ostpolitik in earnest in the 1970s, and Helmut Kohl maintained the policy after he came to power in 1982.
Although Ostpolitik could not change the East German regime’s nature, it did make East Germany heavily dependent on West Germany, and gave Kohl significant political leverage during the reunification process.
Of course, most Korean liberals recognize that North Korea is not East Germany, which never threatened West Germany or the United States with nuclear weapons.
But Moon and his supporters nonetheless find it regrettable that conservative South Korean presidents since Lee Myung-bak did not maintain the Sunshine Policy, as Kohl had done with Ostpolitik.
If they had, North Korea might have become more dependent on South Korea than on China, in which case US and South Korean leaders would not have to plead constantly with China to rein in the North Korean regime.
South Korea’s liberals also recognize that the strategic situation has changed significantly since the Kim and early Roh eras, when North Korea had not yet become a de facto nuclear state.
To realize his liberal dream of national unification, Moon will have to confront a much larger challenge than anything his predecessors faced.
Moon will still pursue his dream, but he will do so prudently, and with an eye toward geopolitical realities.
In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he made it clear that he sees South Korea’s alliance with the US as the bedrock of its diplomacy, and promised not to begin talks with North Korea without first consulting the US. But, beyond formal talks, he could also try to engage with the North by reviving inter-Korean cooperation on health or environmental issues, which fall outside the scope of international sanctions.
Over the last nine years, conservative presidents – especially Park – cut all contacts with North Korea to try to push it toward denuclearization.
Japan’s “Land of Opportunity”
It is our diversity that has made us so successful.
As recently as five years ago, Rakuten was still predominantly a Japanese team.
But in March 2010, in a move I believe was key to our subsequent growth, I announced “Englishnization,” a plan to make English our corporate language within two years.
The goal was to lay the groundwork for global expansion in an industry that competes aggressively for Internet-savvy talent.
When I announced Englishnization, only 10% of our workforce was proficient in English.
Unsurprisingly, some on my team were apprehensive; others, especially those outside the firm, thought I was a little crazy.
But, just seven years later, titans of corporate Japan are seeking our advice in how to build a global brand headquartered in the Japanese capital.
As we tell them, opening doors to international talent has been a game changer for us.
And it could have a similar impact on other Japanese companies.
Consider the experience of the United States, to which Japanese companies have long looked for inspiration.
I was fortunate enough to study in the US, and grew up admiring American creativity, entrepreneurship, and, above all, the country’s openness to outsiders.
In particular, the diverse and dynamic Silicon Valley, where many tech leaders and thinkers are immigrants themselves, is a powerful engine of innovation for our company.
Drawn by the region’s culture and expertise, Rakuten opened its US headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2011.
Today, however, the values that have made the US a paragon of diversity and entrepreneurship are being challenged.
President Donald Trump is attempting to cut immigration, including by building a wall on the border with Mexico, all while employing distressing rhetoric against Muslims and other minority groups.
This is not the way to a brighter future.
As for Rakuten, while we will continue to invest heavily in our US headquarters, we are also investing in growth at home, in order to lure more foreign talent to an open and Internet-savvy Japan – one that, in some ways, is moving in the opposite direction of the US.
Financial Globalization 2.0
WASHINGTON, DC – In the decade since the financial crisis began in August 2007, the contours of global finance have shifted dramatically.
The total value of cross-border capital flows has shrunk by 65% over the last ten years, a decline that reflects, in particular, the sharp reduction in international banking activities.
The question for us is what figures like these can tell us about the health of global finance today.
Are they evidence that “financial globalization” – the international movement of capital – has lurched into reverse?
And if it has, would that be such a bad thing?
The current retrenchment reflects greater risk aversion and awareness since the bubble began to burst in late 2007.
But, according to new research from the McKinsey Global Institute, what is emerging is a more resilient version of global financial integration.
Before the crisis, cross-border banking surged as many of the world’s largest banks expanded internationally, lending more to one another and investing in other foreign assets.
After the creation of the euro, for example, eurozone banks expanded significantly. Foreign claims held by eurozone banks (and their subsidiaries) soared from $6.6 trillion in 2000 to $23.4 trillion in 2007.
Most important, a majority of that growth was within the eurozone itself, where an integrated European banking market was emerging, leading some to believe that a common currency and shared rules meant country risk had almost disappeared.
What is clear today is that many institutions were simply engaging in herd mentality, rather than executing prudent business strategies.
Then, stung by the financial meltdown in the United States, and subsequently by the eurozone’s own crisis, the major global banks reduced their foreign presence, selling off some businesses, exiting others, and allowing maturing loans to expire.
Since 2007, global banks have sold at least $2 trillion of assets.
Swiss, British, and American banks have all been part of the retreat, but eurozone banks are at its epicenter.
Since the crisis began, eurozone banks have reduced foreign claims by $7.3 trillion, or 45%.
Nearly half of that is a shrinking portfolio among eurozone borrowers, particularly banks.
The perception that lending within the currency area was quasi-domestic has fallen apart.
As the financial crisis evolved, private-sector involvement – through “haircuts” and “bailing in” – became a threatening option.
From a risk perspective, domestic markets – where banks had the advantage of scale and market knowledge – became comparatively more attractive.
The EU’s Mafia State
BUDAPEST – Following the collapse of communism, many of us in Central and Eastern Europe had hoped that the region would steadily move toward liberal democracy, and that any obstacles en route to that goal could be overcome.
But in many former communist countries, older systems of patronage and corruption have survived, and taken new forms.
What we thought was a transitional phase has become a permanent state of affairs.
Consider Hungary, which has become a mafia state during the seven years of Viktor Orbán’s rule as prime minister.
Hungary is unique in that it moved toward liberal democracy and joined the European Union before changing course and heading toward autocracy.
The rest of the region’s mafia states, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and other Central Asian former Soviet republics, either passed through a period of oligarchic flux, or took a direct path from communist dictatorship to criminal enterprise.
In these countries, oligarchs and the organized underworld have not captured the state; rather, an organized “upperworld” of elites have captured the economy, including the oligarchs themselves.
The result is a mix between a criminal organization and a privatized, parasitic state.
Most analyses of post-communist autocracies tend to focus on the political institutions and ideologies underpinning the state.
But while these regimes make populist appeals, they are not driven by ideology.
Their primary concern is to consolidate the ruler’s power and personal wealth through whatever means necessary.
In today’s mafia states, key decisions are made through informal mechanisms created by the regime, instead of through formal institutions.
In terms of structure and culture, these arrangements resemble an adopted family, which the regime creates by systematically replacing political and economic elites.
In a democracy, these elites would be autonomous actors.
But in a mafia state, their position is subsumed in a system of patron-client dependency, often through regime-led corporate raiding and rent-seeking.
The classic mafia technique of physical coercion is thus replaced with a bloodless, “legal” form of compulsion overseen by public authorities.
To be sure, corruption is endemic in other post-communist countries that have joined the EU, such as Romania and Bulgaria.
But because these countries have proportionate election systems and divided executive power, no central patronage network has emerged.
Unlike Jarosław Kaczyński, Poland’s fanatically ideological de facto leader, Orbán is a cynic.
LONDON – The past year has been full of watershed developments.
Aside from Donald Trump’s victory in the United States’ presidential election, some of the European Union’s weaknesses were fully revealed, with the United Kingdom’s vote to leave casting the bloc in a particularly harsh light.
But Brexit does not have to spell the Union’s demise.
Instead, it can serve as a wake-up call, spurring action to address the EU’s problems.
Some European leaders are attempting to heed that call, by urging EU member states to “complete the Union.”
Without the UK, they argue, it will be easier to advance integration, as the remaining members are somewhat less heterogeneous, and therefore more likely to agree on steps that Britain might have opposed.
One such step – and a constant focus of attention since the euro crisis began – is a banking union.
While substantial progress has already been made on this front, European banking integration is far from complete.
Unfinished business includes a deposit-insurance scheme, as well as the creation of a senior tranche of safe sovereign assets, or eurozone-wide risk-free securities.
Another potential step, motivated by the profound asymmetry of eurozone countries’ economic performance during the crisis, would be a joint unemployment-insurance scheme, whereby cyclical unemployment benefits would be financed from the EU budget.
Finally, the refugee crisis has led to a discussion of a joint scheme for enforcing the EU’s external borders, allocating asylum-seekers among its member countries, and financing their integration.
All of these – and many other – ideas have been discussed at length, and have even been elaborated to the point that actionable agendas have emerged.
Yet little progress has been made.
The UK, it turns out, is far from the only source of political resistance to deeper integration.
Of course, who opposes integration depends on the specific proposal, all of which are likely to benefit some EU members more than others.
In some cases, a proposal might result in greater long-term gains for all, but carry significant up-front costs for particular countries.
At a time when some major EU member countries are set to hold national elections, and when anti-establishment politicians are deposing moderate parties, many national leaders are unwilling to risk their political capital to push through such reforms.
But what if the reforms were made more appealing?
Breaking down political resistance may be as simple as packaging proposals together.
Growth Without Industrialization?
CAMBRIDGE – Despite low world prices for the commodities on which they tend to depend, many of the world’s poorest economies have been doing well.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic growth has slowed precipitously since 2015, but this reflects specific problems in three of its largest economies (Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa).
Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Tanzania, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Rwanda are all projected to achieve growth of 6% or higher this year.
In Asia, the same is true of India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
This is all good news, but it is also puzzling.
Developing economies that manage to grow rapidly on a sustained basis without relying on natural-resource booms – as most of these countries have for a decade or more – typically do so through export-oriented industrialization.
But few of these countries are experiencing much industrialization.
The share of manufacturing in low-income Sub-Saharan countries is broadly stagnant – and in some cases declining.
And despite much talk about “Make in India,” one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s catchphrases, the country shows little indication of rapid industrialization.
Manufacturing became a powerful escalator of economic development for low-income countries for three reasons.
First, it was relatively easy to absorb technology from abroad and generate high-productivity jobs.
Second, manufacturing jobs did not require much skill: farmers could be turned into production workers in factories with little investment in additional training.
And, third, manufacturing demand was not constrained by low domestic incomes: production could expand virtually without limit, through exports.
But things have been changing.
It is now well documented that manufacturing has become increasingly skill-intensive in recent decades.
Along with globalization, this has made it very difficult for newcomers to break into world markets for manufacturing in a big way and replicate the experience of Asia’s manufacturing superstars. Except for a handful of exporters, developing economies have been experiencing premature deindustrialization.
It seems as if the escalator has been taken away from the lagging countries.
What, then, are we to make of the recent boom in some of the world’s poorest countries?
Have these countries a discovered a new growth model?
Containing the Populist Contagion
PRINCETON – With populism seemingly going viral in the advanced economies, the political establishment is in retreat.
Outsiders are achieving significant political victories by making dramatic promises to shake up or overthrow the system.
The populists’ enemies are members of the “global elite,” who have betrayed national values; and yet their revolt against what US President-elect Donald Trump calls “globalism” also aspires to be a global phenomenon, and actually depends on its own brand of internationalism.
Contagion is a well-understood process in finance.
A shock in one place produces tremors elsewhere, even when there are no direct financial links, because pattern-seeking market participants perceive fundamental forces at work.
Today’s populist revolt is exhibiting a similar dynamic.
Trump promised in advance that his victory would be Brexit in spades; and, indeed, when he won, Dutch and French far-right political forces immediately saw his election as a portent of what is to come.
So, too, did the “No” campaign in Italy’s upcoming constitutional referendum – upon which Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has bet his political future.
An obvious historical parallel for today is the interwar period of the twentieth century, when Vladimir Lenin presented Soviet communism as a global brand, and founded the Communist International.
Benito Mussolini’s Italian fascism – a response to Lenin’s movement – also adopted an internationalist stance: colored-shirt movements, imitating Mussolini’s Black Shirts, emerged in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, to elevate authoritarianism as an alternative model to liberalism.
While intensely nationalist movements such as Mussolini’s fascists and Adolf Hitler’s Nazis did compete with one another over who was more genuinely fascist, they ultimately united to oppose the liberal order.
Similarly, today’s political revolt may be following an unstoppable logic, whereby every country must close itself off to trade, migration, and capital flows, or risk losing out in a zero-sum game.
This raises a fundamental question: can a firewall be built to prevent such political contagion?
Two measures are generally used to stop financial crises and stem financial contagion: international rescue packages and financial reforms.
Similarly, we can envisage a political counterpart to such interventions, perhaps with reforms to global governance institutions and existing democratic frameworks. After all, many problems that now affect individual countries are, in fact, transnational, and cannot be addressed by one country alone.
The most obvious example is climate change, which produces droughts and repeated crop failures, and thus mass-migration flows.
But today’s populists have made a point of refusing to think collectively, or engage internationally.
Anything that looks like a transnational issue is immediately deemed irrelevant to national concerns, and any coordinated international action is ridiculed and held up as a failure.
Perhaps today’s contagious populism will create the conditions for its own destruction.
What Is the Pound Telling Us?
LONDON – I know from my 32 years in finance that the weird world of foreign-exchange markets can sometimes defy comprehension, and that trying to estimate sterling’s baseline, equilibrium value can be an exercise in futility.
Indeed, in the heady hour after the Brexit referendum polls closed on June 23, the British pound initially traded above a rate of £1.5/$1.
This exchange rate turned out to reflect the now-ridiculous assumption that the “Remain” side had won.
The pound has since declined 20% from that initial peak, and it has declined similarly relative to the euro.
Despite these discrepancies, we do have ways to gauge the pound’s post-Brexit performance reasonably well.
For starters, we can compare its value today to its average value during the referendum’s campaign period, from February to June.
Viewed from this perspective, the pound has declined by a still significant 13% since voters decided that the United Kingdom should leave the European Union.
Beyond looking at purchasing power parity, we also have models for estimating real-exchange-rate (RER) equilibrium, such as by identifying the exchange rate at which a country can achieve a sustainable current-account balance, or the rate that would allow an economy to reach full employment.
These models include Goldman Sachs’s Dynamic Equilibrium Exchange Rate and the Peterson Institute for International Economics’ Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate.
The GSDEER’s current estimated equilibrium rate is £1.44/$1.63, and the FEER’s is £0.88/€0.74, which implies that the pound is now undervalued – by anywhere from 14% to 24% against the dollar, and by as much as 20% against the euro – relative to its notional fair value.
These misalignments could be partly attributable to overvaluation of the other currencies. But let us assume that these estimates are at least roughly accurate, and that the pound is now broadly undervalued relative to the currencies of its major trading partners.
MOSCOW – Just seven months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin won re-election, for the fourth time, with 77% of the vote.
But according to a poll conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, if a presidential election were held now, Putin would probably receive only 47% of the vote, forcing him into a second-round run-off.
This is a dangerous state of affairs for Russia and the world.
Of course, poll data in Russia do not necessarily reflect the real balance of power.
Yet such a steep decline is a remarkable development, not least because Russians, who remember well the harsh punishments dissidents faced during Soviet times, often prefer to speak positively of their leaders when asked.
Putin first secured the presidency in 2000 on the promise to raise living standards and restore Russia’s status as a leading global power.
Fortunately for him, oil prices began to skyrocket.
Meanwhile, he set to work reviving the Soviet Union, under a different name but similarly based on opposition to American global leadership and Western-style democratization.
From the start, Putin used media censorship to secure his authority, ensuring that any success – including rising oil prices – was hailed as his personal achievement.
As the speaker of Russia’s Duma (parliament), Vyacheslav Volodin, declared in 2014, “There is Putin – there is Russia; there is no Putin – there is no Russia.”
Failures, of course, were never Putin’s fault.
So in 2007, when economic growth was slowing and social inequality rising, Putin delivered a speech at the Munich Security Conference condemning the United States for its domination of global affairs, and implying that the expansion of NATO into the Baltics was directed against Russia.
Suddenly, all of Russia’s struggles could be blamed on a new cold war, supposedly declared by the West. In 2008, Kosovo’s declaration of independence and Russia’s war with Georgia further reinforced Putin’s “besieged fortress” narrative.
In 2014, after Russian athletes performed impressively at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi (with the help of a vast state-sponsored doping system), Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.
Putin, state media proclaimed, was fulfilling his promise of restoring Russia’s former greatness.
Putin’s approval rating soared to 85%. Russian stores were filled with t-shirts emblazoned with his face alongside phrases like “Thanks for the Crimea” and “The Politest of People.”
For the overwhelming majority of Russians, Putin’s authority was indisputable.
If their president supported a policy or decision, Russians willingly accepted it, however unpopular it had been initially.
Is Vladimir Putin Losing His Grip?
MOSCOW – In 1984, just before Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascent to power, there was a sense in Moscow that the Soviet Union was petrified, and nothing could change.
Then everything did change, exposing the extent of the transformation that had occurred beneath the surface.
Today, a similar mood pervades Moscow, with President Vladimir Putin’s regime appearing stable, even unbreachable.
But, as was the case back then, a closer look reveals a number of chinks in the armor.
In many ways, Russia has been moving backward in recent decades.
In the 1990s, Russia was a freewheeling place, where virtually everything was allowed.
Moscow had 20 daily newspapers, with views ranging from liberal to Stalinist.
Today, Russian civil society is severely stifled, and to watch television in Moscow is to find 20 channels controlled by the Kremlin.
In 1991, Boris Yeltsin, in one of his first actions as President, broke up the old KGB into several agencies, cut its staff by half, and slashed its budget.
Today, the KGB’s successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), has seized complete control over Russia’s security apparatus, including by arresting high-level generals in other law-enforcement agencies.
The result is a single security service that is more powerful than at any time since Stalin – and viewed as independent from the Kremlin.
On the economic front, too, Russia has backtracked.
In 2003, Russia’s private sector produced 70% of the country’s GDP.
Today, the state sector generates most of the country’s output, squeezing out small and medium-size enterprises, and five big state banks dominate the financial market.
Moreover, Putin’s policy of “de-offshoring” has imposed such cumbersome controls on the business leaders of the 1990s that most have sold off their assets in Russia and decamped to London or Monaco.
This trend has been accelerated by Russia’s lack of any real property rights, which has enabled the Kremlin to cut Russia’s wealthy down to size at will, often targeting the most law-abiding among them.
Small wonder that forecasts for annual GDP growth are stuck at 1.5-2%.
The regime wants to change this pattern.
In May 2016, Putin asked three expert groups to recommend economic-reform programs: a liberal group led by former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin; a technocratic group led by Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin; and the more statist Stolypin Club led by Putin’s business ombudsman Boris Titov.
WASHINGTON, DC – One of the great mysteries of today’s global markets is their irrepressible enthusiasm, even as the world around them appears on the verge of chaos or collapse.
And yet, investors may be more rational than they appear when it comes to pricing in political risks.
If investing is foremost about discounting future cash flows, it’s important to focus precisely on what will and will not affect those calculations.
The potential crises that may be most dramatic or violent are, ironically, the ones that the market has the easiest time looking through.
Far more dangerous are gradual shifts in international global institutions that upend expectations about how key players will behave.
Such shifts may emerge only slowly, but they can fundamentally change the calculus for pricing in risks and potential returns.
Today’s market is easy to explain in terms of fundamental factors: earnings are growing, inflation has been kept at bay, and the global economy appears to be experiencing a broad, synchronized expansion.
In October, the International Monetary Fund updated its global outlook to predict that only a handful of small countries will suffer a recession next year.
And while the major central banks are planning, or have already begun, to tighten monetary policy, interest rates will remain low for now.
Political crises, however sensational they may be, are not likely to change investors’ economic calculus.
Even after the greatest calamities of the twentieth century, markets bounced back fairly quickly.
After Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, US stock markets fell by 10%, but recovered within six weeks.
Similarly, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, US stocks dropped nearly 12%, but bounced back in a month.
After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, stock prices fell less than 3%, and recovered the next day.
Yes, each political crisis is different.
But through most of them, veteran emerging-markets investor Jens Nystedt notes, market participants can count on a response from policymakers.
Central banks and finance ministries will almost always rush to offset rising risk premia by adjusting interest rates or fiscal policies, and investors bid assets back to their pre-crisis values.
Today, a conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs tops most lists of potential crises.
Open warfare or a nuclear incident on the Korean Peninsula would trigger a humanitarian disaster, interrupt trade with South Korea – the world’s 13th largest economy – and send political shockwaves around the world.
The Achilles Heel of Putin’s Regime
WASHINGTON, DC – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s authority is weaker than it seems.
In fact, the bedrock of Putin’s power – the clientelist economic arrangements that he has assiduously consolidated over the past generation – has become the main threat to his political survival.
The reason is simple: the lack of credible property rights under Putin’s system of crony capitalism forces senior Russian officials and oligarchs to hold their money abroad, largely within the jurisdictions of the Western governments against which Putin rails.
With the help of carefully selected loyalists, Putin has established three circles of power: the state, state-owned corporations, and loyalists’ “private” companies.
The process began during his tenure as chairman of the Federal Security Service, from 1998 to 1999, when he wielded control over the secret police.
Next, he established his “vertical of power” over the state administration and the regional administrations, as well as his “dictatorship of law” over the judicial system.
And then, in the 2003 parliamentary election, Putin gained solid control over both the State Duma (the lower house) and the Federation Council (the upper house) of the Russian legislature.
At the pinnacle of state power, the Security Council, he installed three KGB generals: Sergei Ivanov, Nikolai Patrushev, and Aleksandr Bortnikov.
To strengthen the second circle of his power, Putin seized control over the state corporations one by one, beginning with Gazprom in May 2001, by appointing loyalists as chief executives and chairmen.
The three top managers of state-owned companies are Igor Sechin of Rosneft, Aleksei Miller of Gazprom, and Sergei Chemezov of Rostec.
Putin clinched his authority over the state sector in 2007, during his second term, with the creation of vast corporations that have since expanded substantially, with cheap state funding, often securing monopolies in their industries.
Because these companies are treated as a source of power and rents, rather than of economic growth, they are peculiarly disinterested in competition, innovation, entrepreneurship, and productivity.
The only relevant standard of corporate governance is loyalty to Putin.
Then there is the third circle of power, comprising Putin’s most powerful cronies – the top four appear to be Gennady Timchenko, Arkady Rotenberg, Yuri Kovalchuk, and Nikolai Shamalov – and their companies.
Their behavior is usually viewed as kleptocratic, though Putin has used his legislative authority to ensure that many of their dubious activities are technically legal.
For example, cronies are entitled to buy assets from state companies at discretionary prices and fill government procurement orders with no competition.
The system Putin has created is strikingly similar to the czarist system that prevailed until the “Great Reforms” of the 1860s.
Indeed, Putin is often called a new czar, because his power is legally unlimited (though his preoccupation with opinion polls shows that public sentiment does matter).
How Americans Became Vulnerable to Russian Disinformation
ATLANTA – As the United States marks the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s election, the question of how Trump won still commands attention, with Russia’s role moving increasingly to center stage.
Each new revelation in the investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 campaign brings the vulnerability of the US democratic process into sharper focus.
Last week, Congress unveiled legislation that would force Facebook, Google, and other social media giants to disclose who buys online advertising, thereby closing a loophole that Russia exploited during the election.
But making amends through technical fixes and public promises to be better corporate citizens will solve only the most publicized problem.
The tougher challenge will be strengthening institutions that are vital to the functioning of democracy – specifically, civics education and local journalism.
Until gains are made in these areas, the threat to America’s democratic process will grow, resurfacing every time the country votes.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intelligence operatives chose wisely in mounting their social media attack.
Facebook hosts nearly 80% of all mobile social media traffic, while Google accounts for close to 90% of all online-search-related advertising.
By inundating these two platforms with automated messages from tens of thousands of bogus user accounts, Russia was able to stoke discord along economic, racial, and political lines.
Moreover, they did it cheaply.
According to one analysis, with only modest ad purchases on Facebook, Russian agents gained access to a goldmine of online advertising data – such as Facebook’s customer targeting software – which enabled the “sharing” of Russia’s fake news hundreds of millions of times.
At one point during this clandestine assault, an estimated 400,000 bots – software applications that run automated scripts – sent millions of fictitious political messages, which in turn generated some 20% of all Twitter traffic during the final month of the campaign.
It is bad enough that the technology world’s marquee names were not prepared to parry foreign meddling in America’s most important election.
But the social media giants’ persistent denial of responsibility for the volume of distorted and false information delivered as news, even as Russia’s role has grown clearer, is more troubling.
Strip away the technobabble about better algorithms, more transparency, and commitment to truth, and Silicon Valley’s “fixes” dodge a simple fact: its technologies are not designed to sort truth from falsehoods, check accuracy, or correct mistakes.
Just the opposite: they are built to maximize clicks, shares, and “likes.”
Despite pushing to displace traditional news outlets as the world’s information platforms, social media’s moguls appear content to ignore journalism’s fundamental values, processes, and goals.
It is this irresponsibility that co-sponsors of the recent advertising transparency bill are seeking to address.
Still, Russia’s success in targeting American voters with bogus news could not have succeeded were it not for the second problem: a poorly educated electorate susceptible to manipulation.
The Martyrdom of Jamal Khashoggi
AMMAN – The London-based daily Al-Araby Al-Jadeed recently published a cartoon, by the Jordanian artist Emad Hajjaj, depicting a faceless man wearing a red and white keffiyeh and sweeping his brown thawb in such a way that it looks almost like he is performing a magic trick.
Whipped up by his movement, papers float around him.
The caption reads, “The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.”
The cartoon names the victim, but not the perpetrator.
True, any Arab – indeed, virtually everyone – knows exactly who is responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.
But the fact that a well-known cartoonist had to disguise the culprit’s image speaks volumes about the fear felt by independent journalists in the Arab world.
Khashoggi’s disappearance has only deepened their anxiety.
Arab countries have a long history of rewarding journalists who toe the official line, while punishing those, like Khashoggi, who dare to speak truth to power.
Since the failed Arab Spring revolutions – of which Tunisia is the only success story – citizens across the region have found themselves with a stark choice between radical Islamist regimes and military rule.
Efforts presenting democratic alternatives have been systematically repressed.
Discrediting, constraining, or otherwise silencing independent journalists is a key tool of this repression.
Autocratic governments create laws and regulations to protect themselves and their cronies from criticism or exposure by independent media.
They claim that only the journalists on their payroll – who praise their rulers and criticize the regime’s opponents – are legitimate; all others are enemies of the state.
Such behavior is not limited to dictatorships.
Even in the United States – long admired for its robust free press, protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, and powerful investigative journalism, which once brought down a president – President Donald Trump’s administration routinely attacks independent journalists, labeling them traitors, paid agents, and purveyors of “fake news.”
Trump may simply be trying to appease his right-wing base and avoid accountability for his innumerable mistakes and misdeeds.
But his attacks on the US press, together with his silence on attacks occurring elsewhere, have gone a long way to embolden violators of press freedom around the world.
It does not help that many of those press-freedom violators – including Saudi Arabia – are among America’s closest allies.
The Social Media Threat to Society and Security
MUNICH – The current moment in world history is a painful one.
Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Vladimir Putin’s Russia, are on the rise.
In the United States, President Donald Trump would like to establish his own mafia-style state but cannot, because the Constitution, other institutions, and a vibrant civil society won’t allow it.
Not only is the survival of open society in question; the survival of our entire civilization is at stake.
The rise of leaders such as Kim Jong-un in North Korea and Trump in the US have much to do with this.
Both seem willing to risk a nuclear war in order to keep themselves in power.
But the root cause goes even deeper.
Mankind’s ability to harness the forces of nature, both for constructive and destructive purposes, continues to grow, while our ability to govern ourselves properly fluctuates, and is now at a low ebb.
The rise and monopolistic behavior of the giant American Internet platform companies is contributing mightily to the US government’s impotence.
These companies have often played an innovative and liberating role.
But as Facebook and Google have grown ever more powerful, they have become obstacles to innovation, and have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware.
Companies earn their profits by exploiting their environment.
Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment.
This is particularly nefarious, because these companies influence how people think and behave without them even being aware of it.
This interferes with the functioning of democracy and the integrity of elections.
Because Internet platform companies are networks, they enjoy rising marginal returns, which accounts for their phenomenal growth.
The network effect is truly unprecedented and transformative, but it is also unsustainable.
It took Facebook eight and a half years to reach a billion users, and half that time to reach the second billion.
At this rate, Facebook will run out of people to convert in less than three years.
SAN FRANCISCO – For years, one of the big puzzles in economics has been accounting for declining productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies.
Economists have proposed a wide variety of explanations, ranging from inaccurate measurement to “secular stagnation” to questioning whether recent technological innovations are productive.
But the solution to the puzzle seems to lie in understanding economic interactions, rather than identifying a single culprit.
And on that score, we may be getting to the bottom of why productivity growth has slowed.
Examining the decade since the 2008 financial crisis – a period remarkable for the sharp deterioration in productivity growth across many advanced economies – we identify three outstanding features: historically low growth in capital intensity, digitization, and a weak demand recovery.
Together these features help explain why annual productivity growth dropped 80%, on average, between 2010 and 2014, to 0.5%, from 2.4% a decade earlier.
Start with historically weak capital-intensity growth, an indication of the access labor has to machinery, tools, and equipment.
Growth in this average toolkit for workers has slowed – and has even turned negative in the US.
In the 2000-2004 period, capital intensity in the US grew at a compound annual rate of 3.6%.
In the 2010-2014 period, it declined at a compound annual rate of 0.4%, the weakest performance in the postwar period.
A breakdown of the components of labor productivity shows that slowing capital-intensity growth contributed about half or more of the decline in productivity growth in many countries, including the US.
Growth in capital intensity has been weakened by a substantial slowdown in investment in equipment and structures.
Making matters worse, public investment has also been in decline.
For example, the US, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom experienced a long-term decline of 0.5-1 percentage point in public investment between the 1980s and early 2000s, and the figure has been roughly flat or decreasing since then, creating significant infrastructure gaps.
Intangible investment, in areas such as software and research and development, recovered far more quickly from a brief and smaller post-crisis dip in 2009.
Continued growth in such investment reflects the wave of digitization – the second outstanding feature of this period of anemic productivity growth – that is now sweeping across industries.
By digitization, we mean digital technology – such as cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) – that is moving beyond process optimization and transforming business models, altering value chains, and blurring lines across industries.
What differentiates this latest wave from the 1990s boom in information and communications technology (ICT) is the breadth and diversity of innovations: new products and features (for example, digital books and live location tracking), new ways to deliver them (for example, streaming video), and new business models (for example, Uber and TaskRabbit).
However, there are also similarities, particularly regarding the effect on productivity growth.
Boosting South Africa’s Diversity Dividend
CAPE TOWN – After an insight-filled and enjoyable visit to South Africa – my first to this beautiful country in 15 years – I am leaving with mixed feelings.
The country’s ongoing process of economic and political development has left those living here, as well as concerned observers like me, both hopeful and worried about the future.
A quarter-century ago, South Africa embarked on its extraordinary transition away from nearly 50 years of stifling apartheid, by following Nelson Mandela’s principled vision to “forgive but never forget.”
When its black majority was finally given a say in governance, it elected an African National Congress (ANC) government that, by refraining from confiscating and nationalizing private property held by the privileged minority, distinguished the country from many others, in Africa and elsewhere, that have emerged from repressive colonial rule.
Instead, the Mandela-led government recognized the country’s diversity as a potential source of long-term unity and wellbeing, and decided to pursue a remarkably inclusive approach.
This model has inspired many others outside of South Africa, not least in countries still ruled by authoritarian regimes that use fear tactics to maintain their grip on power.
Mandela’s approach showed that orderly and inclusive transitions are possible, and that previously suppressed and imprisoned freedom advocates can transform themselves to form a legitimate and effective government.
But the outcomes of South Africa’s transition are far from perfect.
Today, growth is insufficiently inclusive and far too slow, with the annual GDP growth barely positive last year.
The country’s Gini coefficient is one of the worst in the world, reflecting stark levels of income inequality; its rate of unemployment, at 26.5%, is alarmingly high and hits young people the hardest; and too many people are stuck in disastrous poverty cycles.
Poor governance has undoubtedly contributed to this disappointing situation, which falls short of what Mandela envisioned for the country he loved.
Among other things, the government has mismanaged public finances, and it has stumbled in its pursuit of a new economic-growth model.
At the same time, falling commodity prices in recent years have only added to the economy’s economic and monetary challenges.
With the country performing well below its considerable potential, “black economic empowerment” efforts that are meant to reduce historical inequalities have suffered.
But public-sector shortfalls, which have become more visible and better understood recently, are not the only reason for this.
Another, less visible problem is that private businesses’ own efforts to ensure diversity have not gained sufficient traction.
South African companies are not the only ones to struggle in this area.
In fact, much of the business community around the world, including in the West, is still trying to figure out how to make inclusion and diversity programs successful, including with respect to leveling a playing field that is still tilted against women.
Research has shown that inclusion is good for business.
NEW YORK – The US is in the midst of a political meltdown, unable to manage a domestic economic agenda or a coherent foreign policy.
The White House is in turmoil; Congress is paralyzed; and the world is looking on in astonishment and dread.
If we are to survive and overcome this collapse, we must understand its sources.
There are two power centers in Washington, DC: the White House and the Capitol.
Both are in disarray, but for different reasons.
The dysfunctionality of the White House is largely a matter of President Donald Trump’s personality.
To many experts, Trump’s behavior – grandiose self-regard, pathological lying, lack of remorse or guilt, expressive shallowness, parasitic lifestyle, impulsiveness, failure to accept responsibility for his own actions, and short-term marital relationships – are symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder.
The consequences could be dire.
Pathological narcissists have a tendency to indulge in violent conflicts and wars (think of Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam or of Andrew Jackson and the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans).
At a minimum, Trump lacks the psychological characteristics needed for constructive governance: honesty, dignity, competence, empathy, relevant experience, and the capacity to plan.
According to some observers, Trump also shows signs of diminished mental capacity.
The hope in Washington is that “adults in the room” will keep Trump’s dangerous tendencies in check.
Wise civilian leaders are the key to peace, especially given that America’s vast war machine is always revving. Recall John F. Kennedy’s military advisers, who advocated war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, or consider Mattis’s anti-Iran belligerence.
There are two other escape valves: the 25th Amendment, which charts a course for removing a president who is unable to discharge the responsibilities of office, and impeachment for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Both measures are extreme in the US constitutional order, and both would depend on the agreement of Republican leaders.
Nonetheless, one or the other may prove necessary and even urgent in the event that Trump’s psychological instability or political weakness leads him to launch a war.
The political meltdown in Congress is less dramatic, but serious nonetheless.
There, the cause is not a personality disorder; it’s money.
The Three Trumps
NEW YORK – Never in recent history has a change of leadership attracted as much attention and speculation as Donald Trump’s rise to the US presidency.
What this change signifies and what it portends requires unraveling three mysteries, because there are three versions of Trump.
The first Trump is the friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trump’s enthusiasm for Putin is the most consistent part of his rhetoric.
Despite a worldview that regards the United States as a victim of foreign powers – China, Mexico, Iran, the European Union – Trump’s ardor for Putin burns bright.
Depending on who is opining, Trump is either a naive admirer of strongmen like Putin or a long-time tool of Russian intelligence.
There is almost surely a backstory here, one that could destroy Trump’s administration if some of the lurid rumors are confirmed.
We now know that some key dates and details in the infamous “dossier” on Trump’s relations with Putin, assembled by a former British intelligence officer, have been verified.
The second version of Trump is a greedy businessman.
Trump seems intent on transforming the presidency into another source of personal wealth.
For most people, the presidency would seem to be its own reward, without cashing in (at least not while in office).
Not for Trump.
Contrary to all previous norms, and in violation of the standards set by the Office of Government Ethics, Trump is keeping his business empire, while family members maneuver to monetize the Trump name in new investments around the world.
The third Trump is a populist and demagogue.
Trump is a non-stop font of lies, who brushes aside the inevitable corrections by the media with the charge of “fake news.”
For the first time in modern American history, the president is aggressively demonizing the press.
This past week, the White House barred the New York Times, CNN, Politico, and the Los Angeles Times from a news briefing by the press secretary.
Trade Truths for Trumpians and Brexiteers
LONDON – Here’s a reality check for British and American policymakers, and for the many pundits who frequently comment on world trade without understanding its realities: data on Germany’s total exports and imports in 2016 indicate that its largest trading partner is now China.
France and the United States have been pushed into second and third place.
This news should not come as a surprise.
I have often mused that, by 2020, German companies (and policymakers) might prefer a monetary union with China to one with France, given that German-Chinese trade would likely continue to grow.
And so it has, driven primarily by Chinese exports to Germany.
But German exports to China have also been increasing.
Notwithstanding a recent slowdown, Germany could soon export more to China than to its crucial neighbor and partner France, and it already exports more to China than it does to Italy.
For German exporters, France and the UK are the only European national markets larger than China.
Seasoned observers of international trade tend to follow two general rules.
First, the level of trade between two countries often decreases as the geographic distance between them increases.
And, second, a country is likely to conduct more trade with big countries that have strong domestic demand, rather than with smaller countries that have weak demand.
The latest German trade data confirm both rules, but especially the second one.
A big but geographically distant country is different not only in size, but also in kind from a smaller one.
This is too often forgotten in discussions about trade agreements, especially in such charged political atmospheres as currently prevail in the United Kingdom and the US.
In the UK, the House of Commons has already adopted a bill to establish a process for withdrawing from the European Union; but the House of Lords is now demanding that the bill be amended to protect EU nationals living in the UK.
In my own brief contribution to the marathon House of Lords debate last month, I argued that, even if Brexit is not the UK’s biggest economic-policy challenge today, it will likely exacerbate other problems, including persistently low productivity growth, weak education and skills-training programs, and geographic inequalities.
Moreover, I warned that the UK will need to adopt a far more focused and ambitious approach to trade, not unlike that of China or India, if it is to fare well after Brexit.
Sadly, the UK’s post-Brexit trade strategy is being determined by internal politics, such that it is “patriotic” to focus on new trade deals with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and others in the Commonwealth, while ignoring harsh economic realities.
New Zealand may be a beautiful country, but it does not have an especially large economy, and it is a very long way from the UK.
Trumping the Dollar
After soaring in the wake of Trump’s victory, the dollar’s value began to slide in April.
There are various explanations for this.
One is that Trump’s much-anticipated economic-growth agenda has not materialized, and stands no chance of making it through Congress.
Another is that the rest of the world, not least the eurozone, has performed better than expected since Trump’s election.
I spent decades immersed in the intricacies of the foreign-exchange market, so I know that it is foolhardy to assume that one can ever know everything that is going on.
Still, beyond the cyclical explanations for today’s trends, a third explanation has become increasingly clear: markets have built in a risk premium for the dollar, to account for the uncertainties that Trump’s presidency has introduced.
In the course of estimating the underlying equilibrium value of the dollar and other currencies, I have developed a process for approximating where a currency “should” be trading, all things being equal.
This process has generally served me well, insofar as anything can serve one in the world of foreign exchange.
And assuming that it is at least vaguely accurate, we can conclude that any resulting deviation in the actual value of a currency represents some kind or premium or discount.
According to conventional economic theory, the exchange rate can be calculated in terms of a currency’s so-called purchasing power parity (PPP): if the same basket of goods can be purchased with the same number of euros as dollars, then the exchange rate is 1:1.
But in the early 1990s, I came to regard this approach as insufficient, because it failed to take into account that the underlying real (inflation-adjusted) exchange rate could itself vary.
Béla Balassa, Paul Samuelson, and John Williamson were among the earliest economists to estimate the real exchange-rate equilibrium that, in a perfect world, also reflects the balance-of-payments and full-employment equilibria.
But when I was at Goldman Sachs, I developed my own very simple version of this framework: the Dynamic Equilibrium (Real) Exchange Rate (GSDEER).
Right now, the GSDEER for the euro-dollar exchange rate is around €1:$1.20, which would suggest that the dollar is overvalued against the euro by about 6-7%.
I also developed what I called the Adjusted GSDEER, which corrects the “equilibrium” rate for the ongoing economic cycle, by accounting for factors such as the real interest-rate differential between the US and the eurozone.
Which interest rate is best for making comparisons is a matter of debate, as are the effects of quantitative easing; but I see no good reason not to use the ten-year government bond differential, adjusted for inflation expectations.
Accordingly, the Adjusted GSDEER for the euro-dollar exchange rate, as of June 7, was €1:$1.0590.
Given that the dollar was trading at around $1.1250 against the euro on that day, this suggests that the dollar is actually around 6% weaker than it should be.
Trump’s Opportunity in Asia
WASHINGTON, DC – A year after his election, US President Donald Trump is making his first official visit to Asia.
The 12-day tour of five countries – Trump’s longest foreign trip so far – will, according to official briefings, focus on easing doubts about the reliability of the United States and its leader.
Given the challenges and possibilities for the US in Asia, that is an unambitious goal.
Trump will start his trip by reinforcing America’s alliances with Japan and South Korea – alliances that he previously discounted and belittled, particularly during his campaign.
The aim is to buttress his demand, which he will reiterate when he reaches Beijing, that China follow through on its pledges in the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea.
Next, Trump will head to Vietnam and the Philippines.
Close relations with both are necessary to underpin ongoing US efforts to challenge China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia.
President Barack Obama’s administration had mixed results in competing for influence with China.
Trump administration officials have lately hinted that the US may, at some point, devise a new strategy for the entire Indo-Pacific region.
Chinese officials, for their part, have indicated that they will announce new agreements and consider opening parts of the Chinese market that are now closed to outsiders.
So far, so good.
Talks with officials around the region reveal that America’s friends and allies have not received the sort of advance briefings that are normally used to prepare the ground for important new policies and undertakings.
More fundamentally, briefings and statements in the run-up to the trip have shown no regard for major political and strategic trends that are now converging – trends that must inform any comprehensive US policy toward Asia.
The first such trend is the decline of the US-led unipolar world order that has prevailed since the end of the Cold War, and the reemergence of great power rivalries.
China, Russia, Europe, and the Middle East are all headed in new directions, and America no longer has the capacity it once did to influence them.
The Trump administration needs to abandon its complacency and pursue competitive coalition-building.
Trump’s Virtual Wall
CAMBRIDGE – In many ways, the Republican Party’s plan to implement a “border adjustment tax” in the United States is the virtual complement of the physical wall President Donald Trump plans to erect on the US-Mexican border.
Although the border adjustment tax has not seeped into public consciousness in nearly the same way as Trump’s physical wall has, it could end up affecting the average American a lot more – and not necessarily in a good way.
On the surface, the basic idea is to slap a tax of, say, 20% on imports, and to provide tax breaks worth a similar amount on exports.
Most populists’ gut reaction is that this must be fantastic for US jobs, because it discourages imports and encourages exports.
Unfortunately, as many have pointed out, there is a loose screw in this logic, which is that the United States has a floating exchange rate.
A stronger dollar – a likely result of imposing a border adjustment tax – makes it cheaper for Americans to buy imports (because a dollar buys more foreign currency); conversely, a stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive to foreigners.
In fact, the baseline textbook result is that the exchange-rate effect would fully offset the tax, leaving the trade balance unchanged.
If you think the Republicans’ proposal sounds like hocus pocus, you might be right, but let’s hold that thought.
Several highly regarded academic economists favor the border adjustment idea, but for entirely different reasons.
They take it as an article of faith that the exchange rate will in fact rise to neutralize the trade effects of a border adjustment tax.
But they like it anyway.
First, the US imports a lot more than it exports, so it runs a large trade deficit, with the broadest measure (the “current account”) at around 2.5% of GDP.
While that is a vast improvement over the 6%-of-GDP deficits the US was running a decade ago, the US still imports considerably more than it exports, meaning the government stands to collect far more revenues from its 20% tax on imports than it would have to give in tax breaks to exporters.
Indeed, the tax-subsidy schedule could, on paper at least, bring in roughly $90 billion a year.
And the magic doesn’t stop there.
Although it might surprise people who are used to thinking of imports and exports as a pure “us versus them” phenomenon, in fact roughly half of all trade is intra-firm – transactions between foreign and US divisions of the same company.
And because US corporate taxes are among the world’s highest, firms will go to great lengths to assign as much value as they can to foreign subsidiaries, and as little as possible to US companies.
One way to do this is by putting an artificially high bookkeeping price on intra-firm imports, and an artificially low bookkeeping price on exports.
Under- and over-invoicing is a time-honored way to get around taxes and controls.
China’s Big Sticks
NEW HAVEN – US President Donald Trump’s administration is making a major miscalculation by going after China.
It appears to be contemplating a wide range of economic and political sanctions – from imposing punitive tariffs and designating China as a “currency manipulator” to embracing Taiwan and casting aside some 40 years of diplomacy framed around the so-called One-China policy.
This strategy will backfire.
It is based on the mistaken belief that a newly muscular United States has all the leverage in dealing with its presumed adversary, and that any Chinese response is hardly worth considering.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Yes, the US is one of China’s largest export markets – and thus a central pillar of its spectacular 35-year development trajectory.
Closing off the US market would certainly crimp Chinese economic growth.
But the US has also become heavily dependent on China, which is now America’s third largest and fastest-growing export market.
And, as the owner of over $1.25 trillion in Treasuries and other dollar-based assets, China has played a vital role in funding America’s chronic budget deficits – in effect, lending much of its surplus saving to a US that has been woefully derelict in saving enough to support its own economy.
This two-way dependency – the economic equivalent of what psychologists call codependency – has deep roots.
Back in the early 1980s, in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, which left its economy in shambles, China was desperate for a new source of economic growth.
Coming out of a destructive bout of stagflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the US also needed a new economic recipe.
The hard-pressed American consumer solved both problems, by becoming a powerful source of external support for Chinese growth and by benefiting from the lower prices of products made in China.
The two countries thus entered into an awkward marriage of convenience that served each other’s needs.
China built an increasingly powerful economy as the Ultimate Producer while the US embraced the ethos of Ultimate Consumer.
As in the case of humans, economic codependency is ultimately a very destructive relationship.
Blinded by the gratification phase of codependency, both the US and China lost their way.
America and China’s Codependency Trap
NEW HAVEN – Seemingly at odds with the world, US President Donald Trump has once again raised the possibility of a trade conflict with China.
On August 14, he instructed the US Trade Representative to commence investigating Chinese infringement of intellectual property rights.
By framing this effort under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, the Trump administration could impose high and widespread tariffs on Chinese imports.
This is hardly an inconsequential development.
While there may well be merit to the allegations, as documented in the latest “USTR Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance,” punitive action would have serious consequences for US businesses and consumers.
Like it or not, that is an inevitable result of the deeply entrenched codependent relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
In a codependent human relationship, when one party alters the terms of engagement, the other feels scorned and invariably responds in kind.
The same can be expected of economies and their leaders.
That means in a trade conflict, it is important to think about reciprocity – specifically, China’s response to an American action.
In fact, that was precisely the point made by China’s Ministry of Commerce in its official response to Trump’s gambit.
China, the ministry vowed, would “take all appropriate measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights.”
Caught up in the bluster of the US accusations being leveled at China, little attention is being paid to the potential consequences of Chinese retaliation.
Three economic consequences stand out.
First, imposing tariffs on imports of Chinese goods and services would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on American consumers.
Chinese producers’ unit labor costs are less than one fifth those of America’s other major foreign suppliers.
By diverting US demand away from Chinese trade, the costs of imported goods would undoubtedly rise sharply.
The possibility of higher import prices and potential spillover effects on underlying inflation would hit middle-class US workers, who have faced more than three decades of real wage stagnation, especially hard.
Second, trade actions against China could lead to higher US interest rates.
Foreigners currently own about 30% of all US Treasury securities, with the latest official data putting Chinese ownership at $1.15 trillion in June 2017 – fully 19% of total foreign holdings and slightly higher than Japan’s $1.09 trillion.
National Debt and Global Order
PRINCETON – As we entered the new year, all indications pointed to a remaking of the global order.
Donald Trump was inaugurated as President of the United States, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a defense of globalization at Davos, and far-right leaders such as Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders held an “alternative European summit” in the German city of Koblenz.
Trump and his populist allies in Europe have denounced globalization, while Xi now stands as its principal defender.
But Trump’s message, in particular, is conflicted: pursuing strictly national economic interests may require less international cooperation, but bolstering security requires more.
The nationalist thrust of Trump’s inaugural address echoed the isolationism championed by the racist aviator Charles Lindbergh, who, as a spokesman for the America First Committee, lobbied to keep the US out of World War II.
And now Trump, blaming previous US leaders for the economic hardships confronting many Americans, has renounced the country’s historical role in creating and sustaining the post-war order.
While his objection to “global America” is not new, hearing it from a US president certainly is.
Trump’s vision is centered on the politics of debt.
Having overseen a large debt-financed real-estate business, his intuition is that debt renegotiation can be used to win back for America what “other countries” have supposedly taken from it.
He has focused on China and Germany, because they maintain large bilateral trade surpluses with the US – totaling $366 billion and $74 billion, respectively, in 2015.
Just before the inauguration, he suggested that he might impose high tariffs on imported German cars, singling out BMW with particular relish.
With their accumulated current-account surpluses, both countries have built up large claims on the US, in the form of government debt for China and a wide variety of securitized assets for Germany.
While China’s foreign reserves are now rapidly falling, Germany’s are rising.
But, in both cases, immediately eliminating America’s bilateral deficits would simply make Americans poorer.
It would be no different than if Greece suddenly eliminated its large deficits with the rest of Europe.
In the past, US policymakers have tried to spur domestic job creation by getting the surplus countries to run budget deficits or loosen their monetary policy, so that they could grow faster and buy more American goods.
Former US Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan took this tack in the late 1970s and 1980s, and President Barack Obama did so again in the middle of the euro crisis that began in 2009.
This is the classic form of adjustment in the international economic system, and past US administrations pursued this method by applying bilateral pressure, and by working through international institutions such as the G7 and the International Monetary Fund.
But these negotiations have always had rather mixed outcomes.
Trumping the International Monetary System
HONG KONG – It is difficult to know exactly what US President-elect Donald Trump will do when he takes office in January.
But he is all but guaranteed to pursue tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending.
As a result, financial markets are anticipating faster growth in the United States – a perception that is boosting the dollar’s exchange rate against most currencies, including the renminbi, and triggering capital flight from emerging economies.
Notwithstanding Trump’s vow to impose tariffs on China, a resurgent dollar will hurt America’s trade competitiveness.
After all, according to the International Monetary Fund, the dollar was already about 10-20% overvalued in June.
But that is not all.
While trade is supposed to be the primary driver of exchange rates, which should rise or fall to correct countries’ external imbalances, capital flows have grown to the point that their role in guiding exchange rates is now much larger.
In this context, market optimism about US growth could lead to ever-larger imbalances and possibly disrupt the international monetary system.
In 2010, former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King famously used the game of Sudoku to depict global savings imbalances, highlighting that the numbers in the table cannot be chosen independently.
If, for example, all countries want to achieve full employment, and high-saving countries target a trade surplus, the low-saving countries cannot target a lower trade deficit.
So when former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke blamed the loss of monetary control in the US on the “surplus saving” countries, he had a point – at least with regard to trade flows.
In fact, we can also fill in a Sudoku table showing the stock of net foreign investment claims by non-reserve-currency countries on reserve-currency countries, mainly the US and the United Kingdom.
Some of the relevant investment flows have been funded through surplus credit in international markets.
From 1997 to 2007, the US net investment deficit widened by only $0.3 trillion, while the net investment surpluses of China, Japan, and Germany rose by $1.2 trillion, $1.1 trillion, and $0.8 trillion, respectively.
The major investment-deficit players were the eurozone minus Germany, with a deficit of $2.4 trillion during that decade, and the UK, with a deficit of $0.5 trillion.
Over the next seven years, until 2014, America’s net investment position deteriorated by $5.7 trillion, producing a liability of 40.2% of GDP.
The net investment position of the eurozone minus Germany hardly changed during this period, due to fiscal retrenchment.
Meanwhile, Germany’s net investment surplus increased by $0.8 trillion, Japan’s rose by $1.2 trillion, and China’s was up by $0.7 trillion.
Will Economic Illiteracy Trigger a Trade War?
NEW YORK – Nearly 100 days after US President Donald Trump took office, he and his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, continue to commit an economic fallacy that first-year economics students learn to avoid.
They claim that America’s current-account deficit (or trade deficit), which is in fact the result of America’s low and falling saving rate, is an indicator of unfair trade practices by Germany and China, two current-account surplus countries.
Their embrace of economic ignorance could lead to disaster.
The current-account balance, measuring the balance of trade in goods, services, net factor income, and transfer payments from abroad, is equal to national saving minus domestic investment.
That’s not a theory.
It’s an identity, save for any statistical discrepancy between gross national product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI).
It’s true whether you are liberal or conservative, populist or mainstream, a Keynesian or a supply-sider.
Even Trump and all his deal making can’t change that.
Yet he is threatening a trade war because of deficits that reflect America’s own saving-investment imbalance.
A country runs a current-account deficit if investment exceeds national saving, and runs a surplus when investment is less than national saving.
For a country with a balanced current account, a deficit can arise if its investment rate rises, its saving rate falls, or some combination of the two occurs.
Suppose that the US is trading with foreign countries that maintain protectionist policies.
If these countries liberalize their trade regimes, they will tend to import more US goods that compete with their own industries.
The size of the import-competing sectors will then shrink, freeing up workers and capital to increase output in export sectors.
As exports rise, so will the foreign-exchange earnings that pay for the higher import bill.
Suppose, conversely, that the US imposes new import barriers in response to its current-account deficit.
These import barriers would pull workers and capital into import-competing sectors and away from export sectors, roughly leaving the US trade balance unchanged while lowering national income and average living standards.
The trade deficit could fall if the import barriers were in the form of trade taxes that lowered the budget deficit (thereby raising government saving) but that effect would work through the budget, not through trade policy per se.
There is no particular reason why a reduction of foreign trade barriers or an increase in US trade barriers would have any first-order effects on the US saving and investment rates, and therefore on the US current-account balance.
Bad News for America’s Workers
NEW YORK – As US President-elect Donald Trump fills his cabinet, what have we learned about the likely direction and impact of his administration’s economic policy?
To be sure, enormous uncertainties remain.
As in many other areas, Trump’s promises and statements on economic policy have been inconsistent.
While he routinely accuses others of lying, many of his economic assertions and promises – indeed, his entire view of governance – seem worthy of Nazi Germany’s “big lie” propagandists.
Trump will take charge of an economy on a strongly upward trend, with third-quarter GDP growing at an impressive annual rate of 3.2% and unemployment at 4.6% in November. By contrast, when President Barack Obama took over in 2009, he inherited from George W. Bush an economy sinking into a deep recession.
And, like Bush, Trump is yet another Republican president who will assume office despite losing the popular vote, only to pretend that he has a mandate to undertake extremist policies.
The only way Trump will square his promises of higher infrastructure and defense spending with large tax cuts and deficit reduction is a heavy dose of what used to be called voodoo economics.
Decades of “cutting the fat” in government has left little to cut: federal government employment as a percentage of the population is lower today than it was in the era of small government under President Ronald Reagan some 30 years ago.
With so many former military officers serving in Trump’s cabinet or as advisers, even as Trump cozies up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and anchors an informal alliance of dictators and authoritarians around the world, it is likely that the US will spend more money on weapons that don’t work to use against enemies that don’t exist.
If Trump’s health secretary succeeds in undoing the careful balancing act that underlies Obamacare, either costs will rise or services will deteriorate – most likely both.
During the campaign, Trump promised to get tough on executives who outsource American jobs. He is now holding up the news that the home heating and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier will keep some 800 jobs in my home state of Indiana as proof that his approach works.
This is not a sound industrial or economic policy, and it will do nothing to help raise wages or create good jobs across the country.
It is an open invitation for a shakedown of the government by corporate executives seeking handouts.
Similarly, the increase in infrastructure spending is likely to be accomplished through tax credits, which will help hedge funds, but not America’s balance sheet: such programs’ long track record shows that they deliver little value for money.
The cost to the public will be especially high in an era when the government can borrow at near-zero interest rates.
If these private-public partnerships are like those elsewhere, the government will assume the risks, and the hedge funds will assume the profits.
The debate just eight years ago about “shovel-ready” infrastructure seems to be a distant memory.
If Trump chooses shovel-ready projects, the long-term impact on productivity will be minimal; if he chooses real infrastructure, the short-term impact on economic growth will be minimal.
Trump’s Foreign Policy Reversals
CAMBRIDGE – During his first 100 days in office, US President Donald Trump reversed many of the major positions on defense and trade policy that he had advocated during his presidential campaign.
And these reversals have yielded some positive results.
Trump’s policy toward China is the best example.
During the campaign, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office; end the “One China” policy (recognizing Taiwan as part of greater China) that has long guided Sino-American relations; and impose a high tariff on Chinese imports, to shrink the bilateral trade deficit.
None of that happened.
Trump did not label China a currency manipulator upon taking office.
When the US Treasury last month conducted its scheduled review of Chinese currency policy, it concluded that China was not a currency manipulator.
Trump quickly reversed himself on the One China policy as well, telling Chinese President Xi Jinping that the United States would continue to adhere to it and inviting Xi to visit him at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida.
That meeting led to a trade negotiation led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in which China agreed to open its market to US beef and various financial services, and the US agreed to sell liquefied natural gas to China.
The result will be a decline in the US trade deficit with China, with no increase in tariffs.
Reducing the bilateral trade deficit will not decrease the overall US trade deficit, because that is the result of the difference between investment and saving in the US.
A lower bilateral trade deficit with China will just mean a larger trade deficit – or a smaller surplus – with some other country.
Nonetheless, while the Trump administration is wrong to put so much emphasis on trade deficits with individual countries, doing so in China’s case has had the favorable effect of leading to policies that reduce foreign barriers to US exports.
Elsewhere in Asia, Trump warned South Korea and Japan during his campaign that they could no longer count on America’s decades-long security guarantee.
But almost immediately after Trump assumed office, Defense Secretary James Mattis flew to Seoul to reassure the Koreans, and the administration moved ahead with installing the advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, despite Chinese objections.
And then Mattis flew to Japan to offer the Japanese a similar reassurance of continued US military support.
Likewise, candidate Trump, complaining that NATO’s European members had not met their commitments to spend 2% of GDP on defense, vowed to reduce US military spending in Europe.
He also criticized NATO for being unprepared to join the US-led fight against the Islamic State (ISIS).
And yet Trump has backed away from his threat, and the Europeans have moved a little in the direction that the US has urged.
“America First” and Global Conflict Next
NEW YORK – Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States does not just represent a mounting populist backlash against globalization.
It may also portend the end of Pax Americana – the international order of free exchange and shared security that the US and its allies built after World War II.
That US-led global order has enabled 70 years of prosperity.
It rests on market-oriented regimes of trade liberalization, increased capital mobility, and appropriate social-welfare policies; backed by American security guarantees in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, through NATO and various other alliances.
Trump, however, may pursue populist, anti-globalization, and protectionist policies that hinder trade and restrict the movement of labor and capital.
And he has cast doubt on existing US security guarantees by suggesting that he will force America’s allies to pay for more of their own defense.
If Trump is serious about putting “America first,” his administration will shift US geopolitical strategy toward isolationism and unilateralism, pursuing only the national interests of the homeland.
When the US pursued similar policies in the 1920s and 1930s, it helped sow the seeds of World War II.
Protectionism – starting with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which affected thousands of imported goods – triggered retaliatory trade and currency wars that worsened the Great Depression.
More important, American isolationism – based on a false belief that the US was safely protected by two oceans – allowed Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to wage aggressive war and threaten the entire world.
With the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US was finally forced to take its head out of the sand.
Today, too, a US turn to isolationism and the pursuit of strictly US national interests may eventually lead to a global conflict.
Even without the prospect of American disengagement from Europe, the European Union and the eurozone already appear to be disintegrating, particularly in the wake of the United Kingdom’s June Brexit vote and Italy’s failed referendum on constitutional reforms in December.
Moreover, in 2017, extreme anti-Europe left- or right-wing populist parties could come to power in France and Italy, and possibly in other parts of Europe.
Without active US engagement in Europe, an aggressively revanchist Russia will step in.
Russia is already challenging the US and the EU in Ukraine, Syria, the Baltics, and the Balkans, and it may capitalize on the EU’s looming collapse by reasserting its influence in the former Soviet bloc countries, and supporting pro-Russia movements within Europe.
If Europe gradually loses its US security umbrella, no one stands to benefit more than Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trump’s proposals also threaten to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East. He has said that he will make America energy independent, which entails abandoning US interests in the region and becoming more reliant on domestically produced greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels.
And he has maintained his position that Islam itself, rather than just radical militant Islam, is dangerous.
The End of Trump’s Market Honeymoon
NEW YORK – When Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, stock markets rallied impressively.
Investors were initially giddy about Trump’s promises of fiscal stimulus, deregulation of energy, health care, and financial services, and steep cuts in corporate, personal, estate, and capital-gains taxes.
But will the reality of Trumponomics sustain a continued rise in equity prices?
It is little wonder that corporations and investors have been happy.
This traditional Republican embrace of trickle-down supply-side economics will mostly favor corporations and wealthy individuals, while doing almost nothing to create jobs or raise blue-collar workers’ incomes.
According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, almost half of the benefits from Trump’s proposed tax cuts would go to the top 1% of income earners.
Yet the corporate sector’s animal spirits may soon give way to primal fear: the market rally is already running out of steam, and Trump’s honeymoon with investors might be coming to an end.
There are several reasons for this.
For starters, the anticipation of fiscal stimulus may have pushed stock prices up, but it also led to higher long-term interest rates, which hurts capital spending and interest-sensitive sectors such as real estate.
Meanwhile, the strengthening dollar will destroy more of the jobs typically held by Trump’s blue-collar base.
The president may have “saved” 1,000 jobs in Indiana by bullying and cajoling the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier; but the US dollar’s appreciation since the election could destroy almost 400,000 manufacturing jobs over time.
Moreover, Trump’s fiscal-stimulus package might end up being much larger than the market’s current pricing suggests.
As Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush showed, Republicans can rarely resist the temptation to cut corporate, income, and other taxes, even when they have no way to make up for the lost revenue and no desire to cut spending.
If this happens again under Trump, fiscal deficits will push up interest rates and the dollar even further, and hurt the economy in the long term.
A second reason for investors to curb their enthusiasm is the specter of inflation.
With the US economy already close to full employment, Trump’s fiscal stimulus will fuel inflation more than it does growth.
Inflation will then force even Janet Yellen’s dovish Federal Reserve to hike up interest rates sooner and faster than it otherwise would have done, which will drive up long-term interest rates and the value of the dollar still more.
Third, this undesirable policy mix of excessively loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy will tighten financial conditions, hurting blue-collar workers’ incomes and employment prospects.
An already protectionist Trump administration will then have to pursue additional protectionist measures to maintain these workers’ support, thereby further hampering economic growth and diminishing corporate profits.
America’s Confidence Economy
LAGUNA BEACH – Financial markets seem convinced that the recent surge in business and consumer confidence in the US economy will soon be reflected in “hard” data, such as GDP growth, business investment, consumption, and wages.
But economists and policymakers are not so sure.
Whether their doubts are vindicated will matter for both the United States and the world economy.
Donald Trump’s election as US president has triggered a surge in positive economic sentiment, because he pledged that his administration would aggressively pursue the policy trifecta of deregulation, tax cuts and reform, and infrastructure construction.
Republican majorities in both houses of Congress reinforced the positive sentiment, as they signaled that Trump would not face the kind of paralyzing gridlock that Barack Obama confronted for most of his presidency.
The surge in business and consumer sentiment reflects an assumption that is deeply rooted in the American psyche: that deregulation and tax cuts always unleash transformative pro-growth entrepreneurship.
(To some outside the US, it is an assumption that sometimes looks a lot like blind faith.)
Of course, sentiment can go in both directions.
Just as a “pro-business” stance like Trump’s can boost confidence, perhaps even excessively, the perception that a leader is “anti-business” can cause confidence to fall.
Because sentiment can influence actual behavior, these shifts can have far-reaching impacts.
In his groundbreaking General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John Maynard Keynes referred to “animal spirits” as “the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism, rather than mathematical expectations, whether moral or hedonistic or economic.”
Jack Welch, who led General Electric for 20 years, is a case in point: he once stated that many of his own major business decisions had come “straight from the gut,” rather than from analytical models or detailed business forecasts.
But sentiment is not always an accurate gauge of actual economic developments and prospects.
As the Nobel laureate Robert J. Shiller has shown, optimism can evolve into “irrational exuberance,” whereby investors take asset valuations to levels that are divorced from economic fundamentals.
They may be able to keep those valuations inflated for quite a while, but there is only so far that sentiment can take companies and economies.
So far, the exuberant reaction of markets to Trump’s victory – all US stock indices have reached multiple record highs – has not been reflected in “hard data.”
Moreover, economic forecasters have made only modest upward revisions to their growth projections.
It is not surprising that equity investors have responded to the surge in animal spirits by attempting to run ahead of a possible uptick in economic performance.
After all, they are in the business of anticipating developments in the real economy and the corporate sector.
Trump’s New World Disorder
LONDON – So much for the end of history.
Twenty-seven years to the day after the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the collapse of communism in Europe, Donald Trump’s election as US president endangers the liberal international order that his wiser, broader-minded predecessors crafted.
Trump’s “America First,” anti-“globalist” agenda threatens protectionist trade wars, a worldwide “clash of civilizations,” the peace in Europe and East Asia, and further violence in the Middle East.
His nativist and authoritarian views also undermine the shared values, faith in liberal democracy, and assumption of benign American hegemony on which the rules-based international system depends.
Already in relative decline, the United States is now poised for an angry retreat from the world.
Optimists hope that Trump didn’t mean what he said during the election campaign; that he will surround himself with seasoned internationalist advisers; and that his wilder instincts will be tempered by the checks and balances of the US political system.
Let’s hope so.
But nothing in his temperament suggests as much.
And with Republicans retaining control over both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Trump will have a freer rein than most presidents. That is especially true in trade and foreign policy, where US presidents enjoy much greater discretion – and where the damage he could do is potentially huge and enduring.
Start with trade.
Globalization had already stalled in recent years.
Now Trump threatens to throw it into reverse.
At the very least, his victory kills off the faint hopes of concluding the two jumbo trade deals that Barack Obama’s administration had been negotiating: the completed but unratified Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with 11 Pacific countries, and the stalled Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union.
Trump has also pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico.
Worse, he wants to slap tariffs on Chinese imports, which would doubtless provoke a trade war.
He has even spoken of pulling out of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the multilateral rules-based trading system.
Such an agenda would not only threaten a global recession.
It would also tempt regions to split into rival trading blocs – a worrying prospect for a post-Brexit Britain seemingly intent on tearing itself away from the European Union to go it alone.
In Asia, the collapse of the TPP, from which the Obama administration unwisely excluded China, paves the way for the Chinese to build their own trading bloc.
A Fiscal Reality Test for US Republicans
NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump’s first major legislative goal – to “repeal and replace” the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) – has already imploded, owing to Trump and congressional Republicans’ naiveté about the complexities of health-care reform.
Their attempt to replace an imperfect but popular law with a pseudo-reform that would deprive more than 24 million Americans of basic health care was bound to fail – or sink Republican members of Congress in the 2018 mid-term elections if it had passed.
Now, Trump and congressional Republicans are pursuing tax reform – starting with corporate taxes and then moving on to personal income taxes – as if this will be any easier.
It won’t be, not least because the Republicans’ initial proposals would add trillions of dollars to budget deficits, and funnel over 99% of the benefits to the top 1% of the income distribution.
A plan offered by Republicans in the US House of Representatives to reduce the corporate-tax rate from 35% to 15%, and to make up for the lost revenues with a border adjustment tax, is dead on arrival.
The BAT does not have enough support even among Republicans, and it would violate World Trade Organization rules.
The Republicans’ proposed tax cuts would create a $2 trillion revenue shortfall over the next decade, and they cannot plug that hole with revenue savings from their health-care reform plan or with the $1.2 trillion that could have been expected from a BAT.
The Republicans must now choose between passing their tax cuts (and adding $2 trillion to the public debt) and pursuing a much more modest reform.
The first scenario is unlikely for three reasons.
First, fiscally conservative congressional Republicans will object to a reckless increase in the public debt.
Second, congressional budget rules require any tax cut that is not fully financed by other revenues or spending cuts to expire within ten years, so the Republicans’ plan would have only a limited positive impact on the economy.
And, third, if tax cuts and increased military and infrastructure spending push up deficits and the public debt, interest rates will have to rise.
This would hinder interest-sensitive spending, such as on housing, and lead to a surge in the US dollar, which could destroy millions of jobs, hitting Trump’s key constituency – white working-class voters – the hardest.
Moreover, if Republicans blow up the debt, markets’ response could crash the US economy.
Owing to this risk, Republicans will have to finance any tax cuts with new revenues, rather than with debt. As a result, their roaring tax-reform lion will most likely be reduced to a squeaking mouse.
Even cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 30% would be difficult.
Republicans would have to broaden the tax base by forcing entire sectors – such as pharmaceuticals and technology – that currently pay little in taxes to start paying more.
And to get the corporate-tax rate below 30%, Republicans would have to impose a large minimum tax on these firms’ foreign profits.
This would mark a departure from the current system, in which trillions of dollars in foreign profits remain untaxed unless they are repatriated.
The Divergence of US and British Populism
LONDON – Britain, France, the United States – which is the odd one out politically?
Last year’s Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump in the United States were the twin symbols of populist revolt against global elites.
In Emmanuel Macron, France, by contrast, has just elected as its president the quintessential “Davos Man” – a proudly globalist technocrat identified with his country’s most elitist financial, administrative, and educational institutions.
But step back for a moment from these political clichés, as I did earlier this month when I fled the British election campaign to attend the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.
The Milken conference is the US equivalent of Davos, but with a more serious business focus and the strong US government representation that Davos has never achieved.
Listening there to Trump’s key economic officials – Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross – plus a galaxy of Congressional officials and business leaders, made clear that Trump’s election is only a temporary aberration.
The US has taken a detour into a theme park of nationalist nostalgia, but it remains focused on the future and the benefits of globalization, not the costs.
It was clear from the Milken conference that Trump will not deliver most of his domestic agenda.
The Rust Belt will not enjoy a surge of infrastructure spending.
US relations with Mexico or China will not change much.
Trump’s main tax proposals will not get through Congress.
And Trump’s promise to “repeal and replace” Obamacare immediately after taking office is almost certain to give way, under public pressure, to “reform and repair.”
After this immersion in US pragmatism, my return to British politics was deeply depressing.
Political paths that seemed parallel just a few months ago are now diverging.
While the US has taken only 100 days to see through Trump’s “alternative reality” (though perhaps not through Trump himself), almost nobody in Britain is even questioning the alternative reality of Brexit, despite the unexpected opportunity afforded by the June 8 election to avoid a self-destructive rupture from Europe.
How might we explain the starkly different responses in American and British civil society to the dangerous flirtation with nationalist populism?
In America, the immediate response to policies that were logically incoherent, economically dishonest, and diplomatically impossible to implement was an upsurge of opposition and debate.
The Democrats showed unprecedented unity in Congress, television comedians provided even more effective opposition, millions of progressive voters took to the streets, media outlets launched relentless investigations, and the American Civil Liberties Union received $24 million within 24 hours of the administration’s attempt to bar Muslims from entering the country.
Trump’s Rogue America
NEW YORK – Donald Trump has thrown a hand grenade into the global economic architecture that was so painstakingly constructed in the years after World War II’s end.
The attempted destruction of this rules-based system of global governance – now manifested in Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement – is just the latest aspect of the US president’s assault on our basic system of values and institutions.
The world is only slowly coming fully to terms with the malevolence of the Trump administration’s agenda.
He and his cronies have attacked the US press – a vital institution for preserving Americans’ freedoms, rights, and democracy – as an “enemy of the people.”
They have attempted to undermine the foundations of our knowledge and beliefs – our epistemology – by labeling as “fake” anything that challenges their aims and arguments, even rejecting science itself.
Trump’s sham justifications for spurning the Paris climate agreement is only the most recent evidence of this.
For millennia before the middle of the eighteenth century, standards of living stagnated.
It was the Enlightenment, with its embrace of reasoned discourse and scientific inquiry, that underpinned the enormous increases in standards of living in the subsequent two and a half centuries.
With the Enlightenment also came a commitment to discover and address our prejudices.
As the idea of human equality – and its corollary, basic individual rights for all – quickly spread, societies began struggling to eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and, eventually, other aspects of human identity, including disability and sexual orientation.
Trump seeks to reverse all of that.
His rejection of science, in particular climate science, threatens technological progress.
And his bigotry toward women, Hispanics, and Muslims (except those, like the rulers of Gulf oil sheikhdoms, from whom he and his family can profit), threatens the functioning of American society and its economy, by undermining people’s trust that the system is fair to all.
As a populist, Trump has exploited the justifiable economic discontent that has become so widespread in recent years, as many Americans have become downwardly mobile amid soaring inequality.
But his true objective – to enrich himself and other gilded rent-seekers at the expense of those who supported him – is revealed by his tax and health-care plans.
Trump’s proposed tax reforms, so far as one can see, outdo George W. Bush's in their regressivity (the share of the benefits that go to those at the top of the income distribution).
And, in a country where life expectancy is already declining, his health-care overhaul would leave 23 million more Americans without health insurance.
While Trump and his cabinet may know how to make business deals, they haven’t the slightest idea how the economic system as a whole works.
If the administration’s macroeconomic policies are implemented, they will result in a larger trade deficit and a further decline in manufacturing.
Trump’s Bigger Russia Problem
WASHINGTON, DC – Shortly before taking office, US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to outline his vision for his country’s relationship with Russia.
“Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,” he declared in one tweet.
“When I am President,” he proclaimed in another, Russia and the US “will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!”
Of course, Trump is not wrong to try to improve relations with Russia.
(The last several US presidents all sought the same goal.)
But he must recognize that achieving that objective is not worth selling Russia’s pro-democratic activists down the river.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has effectively eliminated popular dissent in Russia.
In 2012, soon after Putin’s return to the presidency, the Duma enacted the so-called foreign agent law, which focused on silencing organizations that receive funding from abroad and engage in anything that can be labeled “political activity.”
Since then, Russia’s government has unilaterally declared 88 organizations to be “foreign agents” – a term that sounds a lot like “spy.”
The list includes a respected election-monitoring group, human-rights activists, pollsters, and even some scientific research groups.
Their mandates vary, but the government’s message to them and others is clear: be critical of the Kremlin, and you will be silenced.
Russia’s government has taken several more steps to suppress dissent over the last five years, including labeling as “undesirable” several international organizations that have supported democracy activists and criminalizing Russian citizens’ involvement with them.
It has also expanded the security agencies’ authority to track citizens’ online activities and curtail their right to free speech, while intensifying discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and persecuting religious groups.
And Kremlin critics have been arrested and even assassinated.
Such activities have apparently not fazed Trump.
Even after the detention of thousands of anti-corruption protesters in more than 100 cities across Russia in March, the Trump administration issued only a tepid statement.
On his visit to Moscow the following month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mirrored this approach, eschewing the State Department tradition of meeting publicly with civil-society activists, despite urging from the US Congress.
Trump and Tillerson, it seems, are fully willing to ignore the Kremlin’s repression of its opponents – not to mention its interference in America’s own democratic election, new evidence of which emerges almost daily – if it means avoiding uncomfortable conversations with Putin.
They evidently believe that this approach has yielded results – most notably the fragile Syrian ceasefire that the US and Russia brokered in July.
Is Trump Killing the Dollar?
SANTA BARBARA – For nearly a century, the US dollar has been viewed as the financial world’s ultimate safe haven.
No other currency has promised the same degree of security and liquidity for accumulated wealth.
In past times of trouble, skittish investors and prudent central banks have all piled into dollar-denominated assets, not least US Treasury bonds.
This may no longer be the case.
US President Donald Trump’s chaotic administration has severely undermined confidence in the greenback.
Since being inaugurated before a phantom crowd of millions, Trump has picked fights with one government after another, including allies like Australia and Germany.
More recently, he has taken the world to the brink of nuclear war by locking horns with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
The dollar is about to face a serious test.
Will global investors continue to put their money in a country whose leader loudly provokes the Hermit Kingdom with threats of “fire and fury,” or will they find financial refuge elsewhere?
Not since World War II has the safety of the dollar been in such doubt.
In the post-war period, America’s extraordinarily large and well-developed financial markets promised unparalleled liquidity.
And because the US was the dominant military power, it could ensure geopolitical security, too.
No country was in a better position to supply safe and flexible investment-grade assets on the scale the global financial system required.
As New York investment strategist Kathy A. Jones told the New York Times in May 2012, “When people are worried, all roads lead to Treasuries.”
The bursting of the US real-estate bubble in 2007 is a case in point.
Everyone knew that the financial crisis and ensuing recession had started in the US, and that the country was to blame for a near-collapse of the global economy.
And yet, even at the height of the crisis, a tidal wave of capital flowed into US markets, enabling the US Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury to implement their response.
In the last three months of 2008 alone, net US-asset purchases topped $500 billion dollars – three times more than what was purchased in the preceding nine months.
Far from depreciating, the dollar strengthened.
The Last Hurdle for Ukraine’s Recovery
KYIV – Ukraine’s capital abounds with signs of hope and anarchy.
The country has experienced an impressive economic turnaround, but corruption remains rife.
President Petro Poroshenko’s administration has stabilized public finances, but failed to rein in clientelism.
The question now is whether any judicial and legal reforms that Poroshenko undertakes can establish the conditions for strong, sustained economic growth.
Since concluding a loan agreement with the government in March 2015, the International Monetary Fund has followed through with four substantial disbursements.
But on a recent visit, IMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton warned that there are risks of Ukraine “going backwards.”
Ukraine’s problems are not macroeconomic.
The government’s current finance minister, Oleksandr Danyliuk, is an avowed free marketeer with a strong record of economic management, as was his predecessor, Natalie Jaresko.
According to the IMF, Ukraine’s public expenditures in 2014 totaled 53% of GDP, but had fallen to 40% of GDP by 2016.
And in just one year, from 2014 to 2015, Ukraine slashed its budget deficit from 10% of GDP to a mere 2%.
It is now on track to maintain a deficit of around 3% of GDP in the coming years.
Moreover, thanks to improvements in the tax system, state revenues increased by 30% year on year in the first half of 2017, outpacing growth in expenditures.
As a result, the government had a balanced budget in January-June.
In April, the IMF projected that Ukraine’s public debt would stand at 91% of GDP at the end of 2017; but the government has already brought its debt down to 81% of GDP.
This progress will likely continue as growth strengthens and Ukraine’s currency, the hryvnia, appreciates.
Ukraine owes much of its economic strength today to Valeriya Hontareva, the former chair of the central bank who cleaned up the banking sector over the past three years.
Under Hontareva, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) shut down half of the country’s 180 banks, most of which were corrupt – if not outright criminal – operations.
And now that the restructuring is almost complete, lending is set to take off.
Typically, when a country gets its domestic finances in order, its external finances improve, too.
The New Abnormal in Monetary Policy
NEW YORK – Financial markets are starting to get rattled by the winding down of unconventional monetary policies in many advanced economies.
The US Federal Reserve started phasing out its asset-purchase program (quantitative easing, or QE) in 2014, and began normalizing interest rates in late 2015.
And the European Central Bank is now pondering just how fast to taper its own QE policy in 2018, and when to start phasing out negative interest rates, too.
Similarly, the Bank of England (BoE) has finished its latest round of QE – which it launched after the Brexit referendum last June – and is considering hiking interest rates.
And the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have both signaled that interest-rate hikes will be forthcoming.
Still, all of these central banks will have to reintroduce unconventional monetary policies if another recession or financial crisis occurs.
Consider the Fed, which is in a stronger position than any other central bank to depart from unconventional monetary policies.
Even if its normalization policy is successful in bringing interest rates back to an equilibrium level, that level will be no higher than 3%.
It is worth remembering that in the Fed’s previous two tightening cycles, the equilibrium rate was 6.5% and 5.25%, respectively.
When the global financial crisis and ensuing recession hit in 2007-2009, the Fed cut its policy rate from 5.25% to 0%.
When that still did not boost the economy, the Fed began to pursue unconventional monetary policies, by launching QE for the first time.
As the last few monetary-policy cycles have shown, even if the Fed can get the equilibrium rate back to 3% before the next recession hits, it still will not have enough room to maneuver effectively.
Interest-rate cuts will run into the zero lower bound before they can have a meaningful impact on the economy.
And when that happens, the Fed and other major central banks will be left with just four options, each with its own costs and benefits.
First, central banks could restore quantitative- or credit-easing policies, by purchasing long-term government bonds or private assets to increase liquidity and encourage lending.
But by vastly expanding central banks’ balance sheets, QE is hardly costless or risk-free.
Second, central banks could return to negative policy rates, as the ECB, BOJ, SNB, and some other central banks have done, in addition to quantitative and credit easing, in recent years.
But negative interest rates impose costs on savers and banks, which are then passed on to customers.
Trump’s Global Strength
HONG KONG – Much effort has been expended to explain Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in the United States’ presidential election.
But perhaps the simplest explanation is the most accurate: Trump’s opponents got played.
From former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was by virtually all accounts the favorite to win, to the Republicans who opposed his candidacy, people vastly underestimated the US president-elect.
World powers, particularly in Asia, should not make the same mistake.
Now preparing to take power, Trump is using many of the same tactics he used during the campaign, prioritizing rallies over press conferences, weighing in on the US comedy show “Saturday Night Live” instead of focusing on, say, the escalating crisis in Syria.
Meanwhile, he is upending US diplomacy, perhaps most notably by taking calls from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.
Rather than allowing Trump to shock the world yet again, we must learn to read him.
The bottom line for anyone dealing with Trump is that he is the ultimate Machiavellian prince, operating almost exclusively on ruthless self-interest.
According to Machiavelli, “the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him.”
So, to determine Trump’s plans, we should start with his appointments.
Among Trump’s picks for national security, defense, and foreign policy positions, a pattern quickly emerges: all are Middle East and Russia specialists.
Trump, it seems, plans to reverse his predecessors’ approach of isolating Russia.
Instead, he will use Russia to help him manage the Middle East.
For Trump, who is first and foremost a businessman, letting a competitor take care of his enemies appears good for the bottom line.
(It also perfectly complements his declared intention to charge US allies for protection.)
It helps that Trump seems to have some affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom most US intelligence services believe intervened in the election to help Trump.
Housing Bubble Déjà Vu
CAMBRIDGE – The 2008-2009 financial crisis exposed a serious weakness in the global financial system’s architecture: an overnight market for mortgage-backed securities that could not handle the implosion of a housing bubble.
Some nine years later, that weakness has not been addressed adequately.
When the crisis erupted, companies and investors in the United States were lending their extra cash overnight to banks and other financial firms, which then had to repay the loans, plus interest, the following morning.
Because bank deposit insurance covered only up to $100,000, those with millions to store often preferred the overnight market, using ultra-safe long-term US Treasury obligations as collateral.
But overnight lenders could command even higher interest rates if they took as collateral a less-safe mortgage pool, so many did just that.
Soon, America’s red-hot housing market was operating as a multi-trillion dollar money market.
It soon became clear, however, that the asset pools underpinning these transactions were often unstable, because they comprised increasingly low-quality mortgages.
By 2009, companies were in a panic.
They balked at the idea of parking their cash overnight, with mortgage pools as collateral.
This left the financial system, which had come to depend on that cash, frozen.
Lending dried up, fear intensified, and the economy plunged into recession.
That experience has prompted efforts to make the financial system safer.
One key objective is to ensure that mortgage-pool lenders will be repaid, thereby discouraging them from running off at the first sign of trouble.
It seems likely that this objective can be achieved if one or two banks fail.
But if an economy-wide financial event triggers the simultaneous collapse of multiple financial firms, all bets are off.
This is bad news.
After all, the housing market overheats every decade or two.
If the system is stable enough, it can cool off without catastrophe.
Now, however, the trillion-dollar overnight repo market in housing mortgages is so large that, when the housing market retreats, financial stability could be threatened.
Trump and the Rebirth of Press Freedom
NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump’s administration has shocked the mainstream press by bullying news outlets and unabashedly trafficking in “alternative facts” (also known as lies).
But Trump’s challenge to the media status quo may not be an entirely bad thing: journalists now have an opportunity to root out the bad habits associated with cozying up to those in power.
Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, drew gasps recently when he told the New York Times that the news media represent “the opposition party.”
Bannon may have wanted to disorient his interlocutors, but he also inadvertently reminded them of the adversarial role they are meant to play.
In a healthy democracy, the press helps citizens hold the government accountable, by vigorously interrogating official policies and behavior.
Unfortunately, it has been decades since America had that kind of news media.
Instead, the press has allowed multiple presidential administrations to spoon-feed it information.
News organizations in the United States have prioritized access to the corridors of power above all else, even when access is conditioned on avoiding uncomfortable questions or accepting evasive answers.
When “access journalism” leads senior editorial decision-makers to identify with political elites, explaining the government’s thinking to the public becomes their primary purpose.
Combine that with cuts to news budgets, and political coverage becomes a mere endless cycle of sound bites from politicians and their surrogates – not unlike a dedicated sports channel covering a football season.
Even the more meticulously factual media outlets have, in recent decades, confined their coverage to a narrow range of topics that tend to confirm the political establishment’s self-serving narratives.
Because they had exposed themselves only to elite perspectives, members of the mainstream media were initially blindsided by the fact that many Americans who had previously voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 either stayed home or voted for Trump in 2016.
But no calamity better captures the dangers of a press corps too beholden to power than the invasion of Iraq, a cataclysmic blunder whose ghastly knock-on effects afflict the Middle East, as well as Europe, to this day.
In the lead-up to the invasion, George W. Bush’s administration assiduously courted journalists at mainstream liberal and conservative news outlets, who then helped it win public support by disseminating what turned out to be false claims about weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
In the US, the only mainstream media organization that ran consistently skeptical articles about the case for war was the Knight Ridder group (which has since been acquired by McClatchy).
As reporters Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay later explained, their middle-tier news service was not granted top-level access, so they had to rely on sources from inside the intelligence community, who forthrightly pointed out the flaws in the Bush administration’s claims.
Journalistic truth telling thrives when there is no need to nurture access.
The Trump administration is already shutting the door on some media mainstays, with CNN the most prominent example.
Trump’s media handlers may be hoping that they can demand compliance as a condition for renewing access.
Tax Reform and Budget Deficits in America
CAMBRIDGE – The Republican Party’s leaders in the United States House of Representatives have been hard at work for more than a year designing a major reform of personal and corporate taxes.
With an election looming in 2018, the House Republicans are determined to deliver a reform package and send it to the Senate for enactment.
This reform will be very different from the last major tax overhaul enacted back in 1986.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 focused on the personal income tax, lowering the top rate from 50% to 28% and cutting rates for lower-income taxpayers.
The revenue loss was offset by changes in tax deductions and other accounting rules, producing a reform that was revenue neutral at each income level, even without taking into account the effects of lower tax rates on increasing economic growth and taxable incomes.
In the 30 years since 1986, the tax rates for high-income taxpayers rose significantly, from 28% to 39.6%, with an extra 3.8% tax on these taxpayers’ investment income.
A detailed study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of taxes between 1979 and 2013 concluded that while the effective tax rate fell in every quintile of the income distribution, it rose well above that 35-year average for taxpayers in the top 1% of the income distribution.
The House Republican plan would cut the top tax rate back to 30% or lower, with comparable reductions for those now facing lower tax rates.
The new tax law might also follow the Canadian example and eliminate the estate tax, while imposing a tax on capital gains accrued before the taxpayer’s death.
To offset some of the resulting revenue loss, the new law might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income.
The new tax law is also likely to boost domestic corporate investment by changing the tax treatment of the profits of US corporations’ foreign subsidiaries.
Under current law, a subsidiary pays tax on profits to the government of the country where those profits are earned.
It can then invest the after-tax profits anywhere in the world outside the US.
But if it brings those funds back to the US to invest or pay dividends to shareholders, it must pay the full US corporate tax rate, with a credit for the tax already paid to the foreign government.
This penalty on repatriating funds causes US firms to leave those after-tax profits abroad.
The US Treasury estimates that American subsidiaries’ offshore investments stand at more than $2.5 trillion.
This method of taxing the profits of foreign subsidiaries is unique to the US.
The Dark Side of Voting Technology
NEW YORK – According to an unpublished “kitchen table survey,” conducted before last November’s presidential election in the United States, approximately 95% of the predominantly Hispanic members of one of America’s largest domestic unions preferred the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to her Republican opponent Donald Trump.
Yet less than 3% of that union’s members actually planned to vote.
The reason came down to economics.
For most of the people surveyed, the costs of voting – including lost wages from time off work, transport to the polling station, and the need to secure proper identification (such as a driver’s license or passport) – were simply too large.
This reflects a broader trend in the US, with poor Americans often unable to participate fully in their country’s democracy.
According to the US Census Bureau, fewer than half of eligible adults with family incomes of less than $20,000 per year voted in the 2012 presidential election, whereas voter participation among households with incomes of more than $75,000 was 77%.
In the 2014 midterm election, the think tank Demos reports, 68.5% of people in households earning less than $30,000 per year didn’t vote.
This is a serious problem.
But the proposals most often put forward to address it have serious drawbacks.
The proposed solutions typically focus on digital technology, which many claim would boost voter participation, by lowering the costs of voting.
For example, mobile apps have been touted as a means to boost voter turnout: people could vote at their convenience, whether in the break-room at work or from the comfort of their own home.
The idea certainly sounds appealing.
In Estonia, which is widely considered to be a leader in the use of voting technology, almost one-quarter of all votes in the 2011 parliamentary election were cast online.
Yet the actual impact of such technology on voter participation remains dubious.
Although the rate of online voting in Estonia increased by nearly 20% between the 2007 and 2011 elections there, overall voter turnout increased by fewer than two percentage points (from 61.9% to 63.5%).
This suggests that online voting may simply encourage regular voters to change how they cast their ballots, rather than encouraging additional voters to participate.
But voting technology may not just be ineffective; it could actually be damaging.
Such technology doesn’t reduce costs only for voters; it also reduces costs for the state, making it easier than ever to conduct elections.
The risk is that lower costs would encourage more frequent elections and referenda, thereby undermining the efficiency of government.
ATLANTA – Despite his seemingly limitless capacity for vindictiveness, it would be a mistake to interpret US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan as only his latest vendetta for lèse-majesté.
True, Brennan has all but labeled Trump and his behavior, including his Russian connections, a national security threat.
But Trump’s move is more than personal payback.
As the most recent blow in his two-year-long attack on the intelligence community, his slap at Brennan is a harbinger of more to come as he tries to bring his espionage agencies to heel.
More ominously for the health of the democracies of the West, other populists are following Trump’s example.
In Europe, a variety of right-wing parties, having now found themselves in power, are taking on former government antagonists, who have monitored and policed their extremism for decades.
In Austria, the country’s populist leaders have been intimidating, muzzling, and purging the country’s intelligence services.
In February, on orders from the populist interior minister, Austrian police raided the country’s main intelligence agency – the very organization charged with monitoring right-wing extremism.
(It should be recalled that the Freedom Party, the coalition partner in Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s government, was founded by ex-SS officers).
And what was the pretext for the raid and subsequent demotion of senior Austrian intelligence officials?
That the agency was running an operation aimed at harming North Korea.
No doubt, Trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt, and both halt the investigation of him led by Robert Mueller and bring to heel all of the US intelligence agencies.
A fan of strongman leaders who “get it done,” Trump admires diktats and brazen contempt for legal processes.
He almost certainly will pay even closer attention as the intelligence-fueled investigations into his presidential campaign’s possible collusion with Moscow in 2016 close in on him.
It is this combination of self-interest and contempt for law that makes Trump’s revocation of the Brennan’s security clearance so troubling.
The regulations governing clearances are straightforward: the president has the power to deny access to official secrets if someone is found to have compromised classified information or is at risk of doing so.
By all accounts, Brennan has done nothing of the sort.
In fact, Trump admits that. Buried in the explanatory word salad that accompanied the revocation of Brennan’s security clearance, the White House claimed that Brennan’s “erratic” behavior was the cause.
That accusation would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious.
The WTO Reborn?
NEW DELHI – For too long, the World Trade Organization has languished, to lift a reference from T.S. Eliot, by the “waters of Leman” (Lake Geneva).
Once the world’s preeminent multilateral trade forum, the WTO has been steadily marginalized in recent years, and recent rebukes of globalization, such as the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president, suggest that this trend will accelerate.
But these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect, owing to three key developments that could enable the revival of the WTO – and of the multilateralism that it embodies.
The first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements.
The WTO reached its peak in the early 2000s, a few years after the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations concluded, and a time when more countries – most notably China – were acceding to the organization.
But major trade players like the United States and the European Union subsequently shifted their focus from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral, regional, and mega-regional deals.
The mega-regionals – namely, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – posed a particularly grave threat to the WTO.
Yet those are precisely the deals that the Trump administration is rejecting, or at least postponing.
European integration had a similar impact on the WTO, as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra-European trade.
But the European project has fallen on hard times, the most salient sign being the UK’s impending departure from the EU.
After Brexit, the WTO will probably become an important forum for Britain’s trade relations with the world.
Any further disintegration of the EU will only bolster that trend.
Of course, it is possible that regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish.
But new leadership would have to emerge.
And no single systemically important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership: internal political stability, economic dynamism, relatively contained risk, and a steadfast commitment to open markets.
However counterintuitive that may sound, a second development that bodes well for the WTO’s revival is voters’ increasing rejection of hyper-globalization.
Hyper-globalization is essentially “deep” integration.
It goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration (in the US and Europe), harmonizing regulations (the ambition of the TPP and the TTIP), and intrusive adjudication of domestic policies (the investor-settlement procedures under NAFTA and the TPP).
In the EU’s case, it even entails a common currency.
