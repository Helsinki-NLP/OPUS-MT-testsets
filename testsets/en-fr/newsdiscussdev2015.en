Sounds like a typical rugby club to me.
At an English university, perhaps...
Not like any rugby club I know about in NZ.
It doesn't make it all right though, does it?
Of course it's not right, but the original premise that this is rife in rugby is just pertinent bollix...
Well we don't interrupt Muslim prayers or break people's noses in drinking games (well, unless that's part of the game), but we have been known to black up for fancy dress parties.
Never played a Nazi themed drinking game though.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are good enough.
I made a similar comment on the previous article as the language and sentiment in the fresher's leaflet seemed fairly typical to me.
However this new information makes it clear to me that they are going beyond the usual misogynistic banter and drunken pranks often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students especially shows they must just be trying to cause as much offence as they possibly can.
You clearly know nothing what so ever about rugby clubs.
But hey, why let your prejudice and stereotyping get in the way of facts?
I would imagine that LSE rugby team is populated by ex-students of those schools that have a tradition of competive rugby union.
In other words ex-public school boys.
Very different backgrounds to those found within the rugby club in NZ, very different attitudes.
So 'misogynistic banter' ok then?
Sounds like the rugby club when I was at uni, never witnessed any racist behaviour, but the naked runs through campus, theft, property damag and misogyny were all par for the course from what I personally witnessed during my years living on campus.
Absolutely not.
Sorry I didn't make that clear in my last comment.
You could look at it in a different way: tell yourself that your body itself is made up, in part, of this ancestral water.
I am going to become more tranquil.
Ancestral as well, therefore, this interstellar cloud (phew, not traditional :))
@lux you haven't read the article: less than half of the water in your pastis is older than 4.6 billions years...
Yes, well, that means that we could even say that all the water in pastis is, on average, older than 2.3 billion years of age, which isn't quite as bad as that
A brilliant middle finger to the believers of the doom and gloom, believers of all kinds who foresaw the end of the oceans and water suppliers, even though this water has always been there.
Irrefutable proof that global warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable works of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).
@manon troppo: Where is the proof that global warming has stopped?
I do not see the link.
I think that the comment made by Manon Troppo is supposed to be ironic.
Hem, and as for the off-beat humor and irony: what makes you think that?
So, you don't understand a lot about ecological problems.
It is not a matter for the "believers of doom and gloom", as you say, of worrying about the disappearance of our oceans, but rather, of worrying about the reduction of the water supply that is fit for human consumption (you know, the fresh water that makes up less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then, more generally speaking, it is not global warming that is the most threatening thing for our species, but rather the reduction in the resources that are not very, or not at all, renewable (gas, oil, rare earth metals) and that support our way of life, which is becoming more and more greedy.
Of course, we can doubt the truth of the conclusion made in the study you quoted for which you have generously tried very hard to provide references.
With regard to the problems of fresh water, I would like to reassure you that the French are far from being involved :). What's more, we have to stop looking at ecology as if it were a flawless dogma; the hole in the ozone layer is slowly closing (estimated to be at 100% by 2050 at its current speed).
Ecology, yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, no thanks.
"What's more, we have to stop looking at ecology as if it were a flawless dogma; the hole in the ozone layer is slowing closing" yes, well, it is not as if it were a spontaneous movement that came from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2, our planet will end up like Venus.
A greenhouse, which, due to the action of oxygen, is going to trap heat and not let it go, and which, as part of a vicious circle, is going to accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Anybody seen direct action yet?
Any sign of 10,000 boots on the ground planting trees and doing whatever the F a green army does?
I certainly haven't.
Maybe in Abbott's tiny brain, sending the RAAF to the mideast is his version of direct action.
We most certainly are going backwards.
When will they dump this village idiot?
Well the latest finding that vegetation consumes a whopping 16% more CO2 than any of the climate models allowed for puts re-vegetation as a priority.
Makes sense, doesn't it, because CO2 is nature's most abundant plant food, and necessary to sustain flora globally.
Seems this bit of science was never 'settled'
Seen the green army anywhere?
Do nothing government.
CO2 Levels rise from 280ppm to 400ppm and the rate is increasing , your argument about plant food is nothing but a bogus distraction.
And before you throw the cup at the wall Dooms, the most abundant plant food is not CO2 but nitrogen and the sulphurs.
The most abundant biologically generated material may be carbon but that doesn't equate to CO2 being the most abundant plant food, so Silverhead's argument is fallacious and deserving of ridicule.
Direct Action is a joke because nothing more will happen than was already happening.
LandCare's budget has been slashed and that money is now being spent on the Green Army.
The rub is that instead of the money being spent where it did the most good it is now being spent where it will get the most publicity for the Liberals to shore up their vote in marginal electorates.
Your contribution however is a winner in ignorance, well done champ
SilverHead, when there's too much C02 in the air, plants photosynthesise less and contain fewer nutrients.
This means that animals and people have to eat much more of them to get nutritional benefit.
The fact that this deputy is childish is proof.
Until now, he has not shown any certificates of his academic rigidity that would stop him from straying away from the rules of the XVII century.
Nevertheless, punishing him, and not Th√©venoud, for this is something that a lot of people cannot understand, even if the rules of procedure of the National Assembly are not a tax treaty.
This woman cannot be given all the credit for dealing with all of this; more than anything else it comes across as being hysteric.
If Mitterrand had find all of those who had made a decision on Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of nouns the "Academy" was offended: "are we going to say the Keeprice or the Keepess of the Seals" (a position that, until then, had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure male chauvinism!
"The political arena".... !
The sandpit, the backyard of the Republic is round, the backwater of operatic ranting, illusion table etc...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, whether you like it or not.
When the male chauvinist UMP party run independently and insist on the parliamentary rules and regulations whilst, at the same time, throwing the most basic of manners out of the window under false pretenses of them being good manners, the inevitable consequences of their partisan stubbornness and misuse of the political arena should be borne by them "ex officio".
The behavior of this deputy is neither normal nor appropriate for his position.
He is provoking people so that he is talked about.
Until now, he was unknown. Now, he can boast about being known, and for being know as a bum from the primary class.
The academy is taking the blame and we are seeing that the deputies are sensitive towards their pockets...
The UMP will have to crack down and sort out its internal problems and stop making mistakes and getting involved in scandals.
The Academy is taking the blame, especially when we are saying they said something they didn't say.
This deputy is behaving like a school kid who is going through a teenage crisis, who is causing a stir and whose mates are going, as a delegation, to see the principal to have their detentions canceled.
and defending them based on a text that they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this UMP deputy forum.
I call on two expert witnesses, spaced several thousand years apart, M'lud.
This is why I love to spend time with animals.
The joy they have in play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otters, horses, all of them do silly stuff for the sheer joy of it.
By contrast we seem to spend most of our 80 years working, commuting and dragging around the shops.
What a weird state we've reached - we have the ability to extend life to twice its original span, but spend most of it in boredom.
What happened?
Anthropomorphic fallacy I'm afraid.
Play is metacommunication.
Try harder.
It's still a fallacy.
By the way 'communication' necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
Difficult concept for you perhaps?
I guess that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
Well, yeah.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate with a dog that I'd like to play - basic body language.
After that there is a variety that indicate whether the play is to be a chase, a run and fetch game etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism - though I agree with the idea that there's a lot of crap about 'play' with animals when they are actually in communication.
Maybe play is not just 'useful' (it may be, it may be not) it is just something that exists in and for itself.
For instance, David Graeber argues 'there is a play principle at the basis of all physical reality'.
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, maybe he would not have raped her", yes, maybe, we live in hope...
Thank hope for giving you the opportunity to live, for being in good health and for being able to reply to an article today when, barely 15 years ago, you had to read information without the option to reply.
In general, I am not against the ideas and would even tend to be somewhat filled with enthusiasm by those who appear to be crazy at first.
But when we see that many have held on to their school education, especially among those who are most likely to carry out attacks on women, I have no enthusiasm in the slightest.
"those who are most likely to carry out attacks on women", we would like to know a little bit more about this.
Or not, that's fine, we understand.
And yes, reality is not always rosy, even if that does not fit in with your way of thinking.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen a lot in class.
They prefer to play on the iphone 6.
Including the youth in Evry who are broke!
If the reactionaries no longer reacted, Twitter would not suggest following Le Pen and Sarko as your first choice any more.
I did not learn any of that at school and I have never raped anyone (nor do I intend to).
Should I consider myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values....
The family micro-society is where we are taught about social life.
How can we start to read about life when we do not know how to read?
And are young socialists going into suburban schools to teach about equality between men and women?
That would be more effective than moralistic lies on Twitter, but you have to get out of the nice neighborhoods...
This campaign is grotesque.
They are all useless, but giving lessons in morals, that is the best.
It all looks very photogenic, yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using your loaf.
This week's column is quite hearty fare.
This is no time for bread jokes man!
Have some sensitivity.
You made a humourous doubled meaninged pun using the word 'naan' to also allude to 'nan'.
60 pounds for that?
That wouldn't fill up a 90 year old in a nursing home.
How comes the more you pay the less there is on the plate.
Because the quality of the experience isn't necessarily measured in weight or calories, in just the same way that the quality of a film or play isn't measured in its length.
Yes I agree with you.
But why should quality food be in portions that wouldn't sate a sparrow.
Makes no sense at all, apart from being a deliberate policy to make you buy more courses
It certainly doesn't have to be that way.
The Sportsman at Seasalter is at least one very very good restaurant where quantity and price are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini courses.
The more you pay, the more likely you are to receive artfully-arranged children's portions.
Well, at least they have gone to the bother of tablecloths.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you're saying I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding London is the only place on earth to get good food?
The thing is, the demonstration for everyone is just a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's it: a kind of gathering of homophobes.
But it isn't just that.
There are also some atheists and humanitarians who do not want modern ways of "producing children".
A child does not have to be brought up in a battery cages or produced by technological equipment.
Battery cages?
Where did you get that from.
And if you contest all technical intervention within "production", you have to call for the ban of ART for heterosexual couples, that would only make it consistent.
I am particularly surprised that the demonstration that claims to be "for everyone" still does not have that logical statement on its attractive catalog.
It is true that it is not only Catholics that are demonstrating: other religions are as well: Jews, Muslims and Protestants.
That said, it is still useful to remember that other churches have ALWAYS been opposed to any progress within society: in 1865 (and I agree with G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup, violently rose up against the will of the government to allow girls to attend school for the sole purpose of "protecting one's family".
We are still that way.
And, more recently, the same trends have been thrown at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family while schools have become mixed.
It goes to show that we can give credit to the positions these people have.
Don't have to be Catholic to be angry about the commercialization of wombs and children...
All of this is nearing the end of decadence for Western civilization, which is contested more and more by other!
For me, liberty stops at that of another: yes, homosexual couples should be recognized, they have the right to love each other just as much as others do.
But it is not a question of tolerating children being a piece of furniture.
And that is also valid for heteros who are looking for surrogacy.
I just can't find it in myself to like him, or give him credit for his achievement.
If he could control a ball better and avoid moments of blistering stupidity, he might have been a more popular player.
Also, I feel as if any striker, aside from Heskey, who plays that many games for England, will amass a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many Peter Crouch would have bagged had he been given more than 42 caps...
Can't disagree, categorically at least :) Since this article is about his goal-scoring I won't go into the other things he offers, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't/didn't) but perhaps that could be another reason why he won many more caps than, say, Peter Crouch
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48pm Recommend 119 Its fashionable to diss Rooney at the minute so you can be forgiving for doing so.
Its worth considering though that since signing for Manchester City in August 2011, Ag√ºero has 56 goals & 23 assists in 93 games.
In the same period, Wayne Rooney has 59 goals and 32 assists in 96 games.
So lots of people are going to have to find another reason to have a go at our Wazza because his on-pitch stats are excellent.
Actually, 'Wazza' is a fairly good reason for ridicule.
I have to question whether you actually watch football if you think that Peter Crouch would A) deserve as many caps as Rooney and B) score as many as Rooney if given those caps.
I genuinely don't understand where the criticism of Rooney's abilities as a footballer comes from.
Well, the hard part is consistently getting capped for your country for 13 years and counting...
You are seriously comparing Wayne Rooney as a footballer- never mind a striker- to Peter Crouch?
You are doing that with a straight face?
Some people are absolutely deluded.
Please bear in mind in terms of the record that also Rooney hasn't always been England's out and out centre forward during his England career.
Instead, playing as the withdrawn forward, the Beardsley/Sheringham role.
He has played behind the likes of Michael Owen, the afforementioned Mr Crouch, Jermain Defoe, and lately Daniel Sturridge.
It clearly wasn't written with a straight face.
In a country where carrying firearms is tolerated, and in a state where 71% of people own a firearm, I find it completely schizophrenic and paradoxical to do things this way.
And, well, the people in that school just do not agree at all with the authorization to carry a firearm in the USA!
using a pencil is still suicidal.
Stop being stupid: the little girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with artificial firearms at that age where we live?
Does this turn them into potential murderers?
Even if carrying a firearm is in the American constitution, which obviously has an influence on the culture of the country, I do not believe that American kids are that much different than ours.
A little bit of common sense and keep a cool head, please.
It is a disarming process!
Surrender, you are surrounded!
The information on this incident is not enough to be able to evaluate whether or not this little girl really showed signs of having morbid tendencies.
Can we not move away from thinking that serial killers do not exhibit strange behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psychological follow-up, then that is more to do with the weirdos in that school than the pupils!
Why don't the parents get their kid out of there: she is in danger!
Completely agree.
The managers of this school are clearly completely crazy.
Your reaction is the most pertinent.
Alabama is not the state that is most representative of the USA, but it is part of it.
What a damn country!
Her relative youth?
Those shiny blue suits the men are wearing are just not entrepreneurial!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear in their early careers?
Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard wore a cream polo neck sweater in some of their early photos.
Can't comment much as I have never watched this, but it all looks, sounds, feels so incredibly boring and soulless.
Don't think that's what he meant, somehow.
Maybe antagonising?
But how depressing this whole thing seems.
Beat me to it.
I'd have thought a nodding acquaintance with the English language would be an asset in business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou is up to now.
Perhaps when he said 'ostracise', he meant 'alienate'.
It would make sense.
No, I thought that might have been his intended meaning, but ostracise still doesn't make sense.
At a push, if all the contestants were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a grey suit, you could argue their intention was to ostracise him.
But here, no.
That seems to have been edited out - bizarre, Maybe the whole sentence is made up!
It's not bizarre.
haha, who knows what he said?
Probably nothing, but someone had to make up a quote...
So, yeah, the article initially did say ostracising, which meant F all.
The unemployment rate in the United States went down again in August, about 6%.
It's been unheard ever since 2001.
Gas prices are going down in all States.
The American economy, with Obama, is getting stronger and stronger.
Who can top that?
You are very short-sighted...
Is their economy becoming "sustainable"?
Living here at the moment, I would say that the United States is getting closer and closer, little by little, to exploding because inequality is getting crazy.
The political system is literally ruined due to the state of financing for election campaigns.
Racial tension, police violence and mass imprisonment are so widespread that we cannot imagine it in Europe. However, Americans stay unbelievably optimistic about their future and that of their country!
Until when?
That is the main question
A few days ago, those in the English financial circle were saying that France was beyond all hope.
Now, it is America that is at the end of their rope.
Fortunately, the UK will always be there to save the world.
Once again, one of those articles that simply forgets to mention the essentials.
The level of consumption in the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debt and printing money; it cannot be a lot longer until change is made...
Against the backdrop of the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And, surely, the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, "will get it in the neck", or rather, will suffer.
Can't barrage the Farrage.
Will it now will finally dawn on Labour that it's cynically deliberate policy of importing sympathetic voters from abroad is losing it significantly more support at home?
Probably not I suppose.
Multiculturalism and diversity must march forward whatever the cost.
LOL It was to please our American masters in their continuing cold war with Russia.
Shameful Labour performance, Ed Millibands in big trouble, 617 votes in it.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour- shocking just shocking
It is more or less on the record that the Blair government's policy of mass immigration was designed 'to rub the right's nose in diversity'
Labour win by-election Tories lose by-election in safe seat to ukip =Labour in crisis Have you spoken to a therapist about your struggle against reality?
I expect that it is that same Multiculturalism that is powering the backlash, the pendulum has swung far since the end of the War, and now I suspect it is about to go back the other way.
Have you spoken to a therapist about your struggle against reality?
Lol- Safe Labour seat, 617 vote difference.
Thats dismal Jack you know it, I know it anyone not in denial knows it.
Sure the Tories suffered much much worse, but for Labour its a pyrrhic victory
Look up the word 'Victory' in whatever context, and you will see when used argumentatively against the word 'loss' it wins the case!
I agree Jack it's a win but a poor one.
Labour should of had this by a few thousand at least.
If they perform like this in a safe seat can you honestly see them getting a majority.
Personally i'm in different about who ultimately wins come 2015 just as long as the lib dems aren't involved.
You obviously dont understand how our parliamentary democracy works do you.
Yes, I know the ice caps of Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia, are on solid grounds.
On the other hand, I wonder if the aligning of Venus and Mars etc. should be considered as well?
In general, you have to look at Earth as being more "tough" or malleable than what we think.
Is that so?
A bit perplexing.
On the other hand, Wylie talks of a "rather simple mechanism: with the melting of the ice, which weighs down on the Earth's crust, the pressure placed on the mantel is released, which causes/would cause 1) a boost in the production of magma, and 2) the facilitation of its access to the surface???
In any case, whether it is the "boost" or the facilitation of access to the surface, they would be (more or less) localized.
It is hard to distinguish the cause from the effect and vice versa. With regard to global warming, I think it would be wise to focus more on the effects it has on our environment, which is already quite complicated.
In a very friendly manner, patricedusud, does this volcanism not have an effect on our environment?
Is there not an effect on our global warming, whether in the future or passed?
Wouldn't it be wise to no longer cause global warming?
When complexity is not resolved by simplification, we apply such simplicity and observe what happens.
Yes, but also, when it is dark, we see less well.
Hello, the end of the last ice age was also accompanied by stronger seismic activity, most notably in the "active" mountain ranges, or in the iciest continental areas such as Canada and Scandinavia).
Kind regards, CB
All too often we ignore the fact that the Earth's crust is floating on magma, and that the single passing of the moon causes this to rise or fall, recorded to be some 30 to 60cm, according to its position in relation to the zenith, in much the same way it does for ocean water.
Whatever enables the tectonic plates to move, just like waves, is more or less facilitated by this moving lump, especially given the polar caps are reduced by ice thawing, which in turn causes a shift in the balance of land in relation to the equator, since the volume of land is consistent.
I laught at the 'human', who claims to be the supreme being of Nature and its self-proclaimed leading leader, yet who makes a fool of himself due to the stupid actions it inflicts on the very environment that created him, and from which he has separated himself so much, something that has proven harmful to both himself and to the environment.
And all of this in order to stay the supreme leader of a nature that surpasses him in the organization of his own viscera, a leader who, thanks to an invention, money, finds all the possible means of dominating his fellow beings, disregarding partnership.
The Earth's crust is not on top of magma, but is below the Earth's mantel, which is made up of solid rock.
Personally I find him unwatchable.
Smug and arrogant.
Reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Really looking forward to the next part.
Cool story Wild1
Reminds me more of an absolutely fantastic series from about 2002 called 'Ape-man'.
One the best documentary series I've ever seen.
For some reason, it hardly seems to be remembered now.
Pity you never made it past the first impression.
Your loss...
"Geladas, distant ancestors of ours" You might need to re-watch that bit.
Or read up on evolution.
Great programme thanks Brian
I'm pretty sure the "history of man" documentary has been done several times before, they always go to ethiopia (obviously)
Jeez I can't stand the bloke, Brian "air miles" Cox, travelling all the way to Ethiopia so he can pretend to look all doe-eyed over a brain in a jar.
And his dialogue...
It must be so hard for you, forced to watch Coxy.
There might be a support group for you ,though.
I agree, all portrayed in a way I understood.
Loved the programme, beautifully filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist according to the political compass?
Indeed, it is individualist identities that prevail nowadays.
So, she needs to be herself, and non-compliant.
Of course, but Descartes is also somewhat individualistic at the moment, and his intellectual inquiry shows that.
But at that time, they were the only assumptions around; nowadays, individualism gives structure to all of society, whether educated or not, whether cultured or not, whether rich or poor...
We are in the midst of "mass" individualism!!
Don't want to keep going on and on, but aren't there some similarities here with the Cartesian approach when analyzing what we come to believe and what we believe ourselves.
More so than rebellion, doubt is productive.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and associate themselves with it.
His work on psychiatry does have one negative - reform!
By making the problem equal to his paranoia, he put a stop to any progress being done and any consideration for the reality of insanity.
And brought about the most reducing and reactionary vision: behaviorism.
Gauchet was absolutely right on this point, and being anti-conformist means fighting against being brainwashed.
We reproach Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of order.
Excellent idea!
Whether beautiful or rebellious, we are asking some...
black people and North Africans, as well as others.
Whether redneck or robot, there are more of them who follow in the footsteps of people who think they are from North Africa when they look in their mirror.
Thanks anyway to his rebellious controversy, Marcel Gauchet has been put back in the spotlight - such a patient and persevering humanist who is so enlightening from a pedagogical point of view.
David Cameron backs raising of inheritance tax threshold
What further cuts will be required to pay for this rich person's benefit?
Robot Dave will greatly increase his net worth once he's out of power.
Corporate boards, speaking engagements, consulting fees, a ghost-written bestselling series of books on "serious policy"--he'll be worth ¬£100 by the time he shuffles off this mortal coil.
Naturally, he doesn't want any inheritance tax.
Is this not the same lie as the last election?
And the very rich are those least likely to pay inheritance tax by using highly paid accountants and tax avoidance schemes.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
he'll be worth ¬£100 by the time he shuffles off this mortal coil.
What rubbish.
He'll probably promise to raise the threshold to ¬£1million, well below what you claim he's worth.
What was your view when labour doubled the threshold to 650k for couples?
Did you also think that Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a non thinking tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we got a coalition instead.
You can only accuse him of lying if we'd actually voted him into power.
As with all of the rest of us, 'Dave' will not be dying a 'normal' death.
Climate change and the coming collapse will finish him and his ilk off.
His 'wealth' will be as usless as anyone else's and will not save him or his children.
Tax-free income is a benefit, especially in a country where government debt has passed ¬£1,000,000,000,000.
We all have to be taxed to pay for essential services and pay down the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
Of course, I am not saying that didactics is useless, I am only saying that it is not enough to make up for certain natural "inadequacies".
Not a very rational statement considering the math prof she was!
Like what...
Recruit better and train teachers better; that falls under a qualitative approach.
Yet, the French political class is not familiar with any approach other than the qualitative one.
There are 2 possible solutions: the 1st is to choose teachers based on their ability to pass on knowledge => change the recruitment process.
What's more, they hate children because they do not understand them.
Because they don't understand them, they do not know how to act or react to working well => they have been reduced to establishing a relationship based on distrust, which makes everyone suffer for no reason => we need 1 course for all teaching.
A job that can be taught, for sure.
But, above all else, teaching is an art, a natural disposition and a vocation, rather than being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not the same as manufacturing car parts.
Pedagogy is not the same things as being a math prof!
The "science of education" cannot make up for a lack of natural talent.
What we are missing today is a real vocation for many of those who enter the profession
If the gift is real, then pedagogy (I prefer the term didactics) enables those for whom it is not as easy to avoid making mistakes.
There are several ways of addressing issues more effectively.
The thing that is really not known nowadays is that of all the pupils1/3 tell us: learning is good for nothing; I already know what I think.
An article by Slate described rather well the chaotic situation of returning to school this year.
Let's lament the old Teacher Training Colleges...
She finishes at 0300 as of this week, but starts at midnight.
It may well suit her schedule anyway.
Oh I didn't know that, thanks.
It doesn't suit mine!
Her programme has started at midnight for years.
We have this thing called iplayer where we can listen to programs on demand when we want to!
This internet thing is rather amazing isn't it!
Don't get iPlayer on my phone and with a max of 4MB download speed at my home, can't really listen to a radio show either.
I have a dobgle type adapter in the back of my SKY box linked to the broadband but listen to radio through my tele seems a bit of a drag.
Yeah i think i got my timings mixed up, must've emant Richard Lester at 3 ish.
Although its men during the day on Radio 2, the least they could do would be to put in a women in his broadcasting slot when one of the men are off on holiday or sick, that at least would keep people happy.
They should start with getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
His show is sensationalist nonsense disguised as debate and would be more at home on stations like LBC.
the lack of female DJs in daytime, where none of the regular presenters from Chris Evans at breakfast to Simon Mayo‚Äôs drivetime show are women
That's five shows.
So which (of those five) is most likely to change.
Shennan clearly knows, but he's not saying - yet.
Steve Wright is looking most semi-detatched these days.
Jeremy Vine might get 'booted upstairs' back into proper journalism, but lunchtime retains the frosty aspect of radio Daily Mail.
I suspect he's sitting back, waiting for the current roster to 'get hired or get tired'.
I was born in Soisson in 1950!
Too late??
It is normal that these kinds of people vote for the FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties taking it in turns to be in power, and returning the keys to the country to the other party in a worse state than when they received them.
The countryside is very poor; clearly poorer than the suburbs and more isolated.
You have to go for miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym or a theater.
But, because they don't burn any cars, they aren't aggressive, and aren't dealing drugs, they are not interesting to politicians...
But, please, don't speak about a department where you have not lived.
Yes, Doclocal, they are subhuman; sociology is good to take interest in them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on the stupidity of people, their lack of culture and ignorance, let's just say that there is huge potential for its growth, you would really have to be bad not to have done any better...
Nowadays, the FN thrives, mostly, on misery and daily fear, fear of the other, and the feeling of having no perspectives.
But yes, you are right!
How pathetic is humanity.
Fortunately, there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, educated and erudite to save our reputation.
They had it coming.
Taking the voters for c...
Well, that's what happens.
Who are "they"?
"forgotten", in fact, there are fewer and fewer resources => reduce grants.
this was my comment on twitter (@priya963) Hear hear - you can't simply 'add in and stir', women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by the above is that in many developing countries, existing norms are challenged, such as childcare or social reproductive roles.
This leads to a recognition that women can work in the economic sphere and that is great - this is necessary.
But it can't simply be done without acknowledging that women then have a double burden, where they are now expected to go to work as well as still comply with their social reproductive role.
Not sure abou that sister.
Economy or profits do not recognise gender roles.
Money talks and if a gender isn't up to it than roll over !
Profits couldn't care less about how hard you have it.
What do you, where is the benefit and what do you offer?
Profits couldn't care less about heroics and child rearing.
If it was criminal offence then companies would listen.
Friends who employ will never employ s female between the age of 20 to 45.
Well said sister.
Very problematic that there is no mention of unpaid care work in this article.
In some countries, the value unpaid care work (which women perform a far disproportionate share of) has to be shown to be equivalent to over 50% of GDP.
Unpaid care work is chronically under-supported and under-valued (not to mention under-shared by men), but it keeps our whole workforces and societies running.
Unpaid care work is also a major reason why many women are unable to seek meaningful 'economic empowerment' outside of the home...
Thanks for everyone's comments so far - on Mskaydee's point, how can we factor in responsibilities disproportionally placed on women when carrying out gender inclusion projects?
A very practical article.
I am sure that this is helpful for all those people who have to 'tick a gender box'.
The tiger is not Russian, that is just Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and would be better off sitting at the negotiating table.
The tiger has a right to self-determination, and the Russian soldiers are simply doing exercises near to the boarder, exercises that were organized a long time before this situation.
In addition, the tiger did not have any anti-aircraft missiles.
Free Tigerstan!
You made my day!
Ah yes, you see.
I got the same kind of idea straight away.
There you go, an excuse for arming some separatists with the aim of annexing China.
If the tiger from Siberia is in China, that is because China is in Siberia.
It is about time to fix this anomaly.
Why is an article on a tiger, a magnificent feline that is in real danger of extinction, turning out to be a silly article aimed at Putin?
What does he have to do with it?
So, this isn't an article on a tiger from Siberia, but an article on the consequences of a communication campaign by Putin.
When we are exposed so much to the media, we are also exposed to irony, and indeed, criticism.
It is the same old story, constant victimization of the soviet-Putin sympathizers.
Hollande also received his share of criticism about his camel, without us crying out about it being an anti-French conspiracy.
Our apprentice, Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, Patron Saint of Great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he is leaving...
Hollande getting battered, that's one thing.
On the face of it, this seems like a horribly patronising idea.
But, based on the article, it seems that it is both a response to a genuine problem - the emergency dental grants - and quite effective.
So it is hard to fault it.
And if only 53% of this trial group were brushing their teeth before hand, and 73% after, it is a bit hollow to complain about paternalism.
After all, there is no downside to brushing your teeth!
Indeed - the crux of the complaints seem to be that they are targeted at the unemployed and that is reinforcing a negative stereotype.
But if it's actually accurate, that's not really a fair criticism.
Belinda Smith, from Canterbury district health board, said the ministry was concerned by the number of emergency dental care grants being given by the Ministry of Social Development‚Äôs Work and Income service to unemployed young adults.
There would be a number of ways to implement it which might have been better for PR purposes, I suppose.
But it seems reasonably well devised.
There is a downside to brushing teeth.
If you brush after drinking wine it can damage the precious enamel coating.
If your toothbrush is old and wiry it can spike and inflame gums.
And I remember a show on the Guiness Book of Records, where somebody attempted to brush their teeth for the longest time and the Guiness officials at the time strongly discouraged it because of the harmful effects of prolonged and frequent toothbrushing.
' on the face of it ' - very funny .
It sounds like piss poor experimental design to me.
The mere act of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of the participants who knew their brushing behaviour was being studied.
That's why most studies of behaviour involve such things as double-blinds, control groups, etc.
There's no way to project those results onto the program itself.
Assuming those texts are sent to every young welfare recipient, there are two things that make that different from the experiment: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they are not providing feedback of when they do or do not brush (results easily buggered up by people reporting according to perceived expectations).
Are there any epigenetic consequences?
Studies (Prof. Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits could be passed on to the next generation.
Does a uterus transplant affect this phenomenon?
The implantation itself resembles a kind of transplant.
There probably are consequences, but as long as we do not want to give birth to an impossible clone that is the perfect copy of ourselves, is that really a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond reasonable limits.
The desire to become a mother or father must not push us to go further and further without addressing the issue of ethics and questioning the risks taken for the mother and her baby.
No, medicine is not all-powerful; no, it is not limitless, and yes, it is unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have the child or children they want to have.
That has nothing, nothing at all, to do with the tran
But leave people, women and others, to use their bodies and their idea of love how they want to, even if that leads to taking risks, and you look after your little testicles all by yourself, all by yourself in your trousers.
to "entrust" them with this magical sack so that they can enjoy the marvelous time of being pregnant.
Why would I keep it in my safe doing nothing if he can still give love.
The tight circumstances of late make Prof Frydman cautious in what he says, but if "we" were willing to reflect, "we" would admit that it is just the sack, and not the genetic material involved.
What will the arguments against it be: see here, these reactions are all from men funnily enough...
Marjane, no organ donation is harmless.
Over the years I have been a plasma donor, it is not completely harmless.
I was registered as a bone marrow donor (I was never chosen because the selection process is very rigorous for both the recipient and the donor), it is a real operation.
Now, as a man, I would not like to judge either side, or take part in this donation, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: indeed, it is not harmless, and that reinforces the act of love, which it implies.
Donating a kidney to a member of your family who needs it is not harmless either, and that happens!
Please, no Messi v Ronaldo shenanigans .
It's really bitchy
Agreed, there's no need for any of that.
Particularly as it's not much of a competition anymore....
Ronaldo the best athlete.
Messi the best footballer.
Deportivo has become a yo-yo club.
They too good for the Segunda division but not up to standards of La liga.
Rivaldo wasn't part of the title-winning side.
Thanks for fixing it mate.
But Rivaldo did played for Deportivo before he moved to Barcelona.
Ronaldo still doing everything possible to break all Real Madrid scoring records this season, so he can head back to Old Trafford in the summer with a clean conscience...
I don't buy that.
I think Ronaldo will end his career at the Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you mean the international petroleum investment company stadium?
Was watching it on a crappy feed so cant tell you much about it other than Valencia defended well and possession aside deserved the win.
Was worried the midfield would get bypassed too quickly but they did well.
Parejo‚Äôs all-round game is improving.
Terrible weak penalty claim then deservedly saved by Diego.
A rowdy Mestalla and it cant have been fun for the Atletico bus being bombarded.
That's interesting.
A full article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, "on the origins of mummification", well illustrated, appeared in the magazine called Arch√©olgia 524 last September.
It is good to have arguments that confirm and date what we intuitively guess.
Not surprising that before making it complicated, we made it easy.
All science progresses step by step.
And what was "the organ" he preserved from the woman in this way?
Fascinating!
Hello and thanks for your posts.
I seem to recall having read some time ago that the mummy of a black child was discovered in modern day Libya, and that this discovery opened new doors, most notably in terms of geography and time (I think I recall the mummy being more than 1000 years before the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information on that?
Thanks in advance.
She is interfering a bit with the reading.
Maybe these are not due to the influences of modern times.
Back then, didn't the desert cover a smaller area than it does now?
Why not imagine plants, such as cannabis, growing in the area where there is only sand nowadays?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scientist to claim, even without any proof, so that it becomes a scientific truth: the Egyptians, and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today, have never discovered anything, not even in their own countries.
But the song does not tell us who discovered the African discoveries in Africa.
It is, and always was, "not well known by its precursors".
You should read the article.
This is an article by free market neo-liberal quacks, which argues against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are a few others with Ebola that the Spanish government is lying about, in order to not look bad/affect tourism.
Presently I would hope tourism is the least of their considerations.
But they might be staying silent to prevent complete panic.
I would also hope that about tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (ie those in Spain and the UK) tend to put all business interests before people.
Give it a break, feel free to call you local MP and complain about a lack of transparency.
Whilst I think the government here are a mob of useless, corrupt f*ckers but as Madrid is not a major tourism hotspot I doubt that is their top concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all due respect and sympathy to the nurse and her colleagues), seeing as how tourism is one of the only things keeping millions of people in this country afloat, I'd say that yes, it is important.
If they absolutely had to repatriate the missionaries, I don't know why they couldn't have sent them to a remote military airbase and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than, for example, the capital city.
Rajoy was on a campaign to dismantle the Spanish Health Service, privatising nationalised hospitals especially in Madrid which is his power base until the Courts intervened.
He is just another smooth talking right wing PR man like Cameron and like Cameron I think he is doomed at the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not the done thing here) socially he is far to the right of him and would fit in well with the loony right wing religious nuts in America.
Now he is having to praise the very hospitals he was rubbishing to try and achieve his aims of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or other European right-wingers to the Spanish right...
They are on a league of their own, trust me.
The Spanish government is lying about nearly everything which concerns it.
Not that anyone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumours.
So you'll have some hard evidence to back up that thought, right?
This section of the Guardian is called Comment is Free.
Thank you Mr Supiot.
Without making work the central point of production and the economy, with its rights and guarantees, we will never get out of it.
Excellent article but above all fascinating reactions in the forum.
Too many bosses of VSBs and SMB seem to read le Monde just to take the time to disapprove of the remarks made by the Prof.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the surrounding era.
It seems that a law lecturer at the Coll√®ge de France cannot know about the work market unless he has received the Nobel Prize for economics and suggests liberalizing it completely
It was so much better before. It is true that when Dr Villerm√© recorded the work done by 8 year old children, working 10 hours per day, the Canuts were shooting on sight because of a collectively signed agreement.
Ah, the good old days...
Your reaction is all the more fascinating given your ignorance on the topic of bosses of VBS!
It is not his job to know all the ins and outs of the law, but rather to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts were put on my payslip when I was in my adolescence, more than 100 pieces of information now!
Here is an example, we could quote many more, which illustrates the constant amount of pressure imposed without consideration for the consequences that suffocate little businesses.
Your article would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
Just to put a twist on the very common argument that is the thickness of the French Labor Code compared to the Swiss one; a serious scholar would have their head buried in the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of the latter could mean that the Swiss laws are more understandable than our own).
Comments in the Code, whether labor related or not, are our way of targeting, most notably, the legal system...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the law when an employee has been dismissed, for instance....
Where is it complicated??
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, the legal system, agreements and contacts) are impossible, at least as far as Work and Business is concerned?
What does he do?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has basically become immune to criticism Ms.
Is this bloke still in vogue?
Surely it's time for some new groundbreaking nonsense to bowl over the critics...
Every Ai weiwei article i've read recently, you are there within the first three comments complaining about his popularity.
Get over it!
Look elsewhere, there's plenty of choice in the world of art.
If China can produce some more artists that aren't communist party mouth pieces the world will be interested.
YesGhengisCan is probably a chinese government troll.
I think China has produced plenty of great contemporary artists.
The ones that are Communist mouthpieces aren't appreciated in the West, and the ones that aren't mouthpieces are perhaps not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you that feel Al Weiwei's art is some sort of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thanks for that, you've just ruined my breakfast.
I apologise, but he had to be exposed (no pun intended).
This is the guy who smashes irreplaceable ancient ceramics and calls his actions art, isn't it?
There's art, and then there's attention seeking vandalism.
Genuine artists know the difference.
A fine artist.
Father a decent poet too.
His father was a really famous poet in China.
Exiled during the Cultural Revolution.
KARSENTY RESIGNS, this man is not worthy of an elected office, extremists from all political backgrounds (including Zionists) must be moved to the side
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him many convictions, are a disgrace to both Israel and Neuilly council.
He does not represent anyone.
Philippe Karsenty is leading the fight against truth to the sideline, all by himself.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
What does Neuilly council intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who hurls abuse at a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for this town-planner to be attacked?
Apology for a crime?
I cannot find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that has new privileges???
This fella needs help, in the same way that Ulcan Chelli does. Both of them are involved in anti-Jewish/anti-Israeli conspiracy theories, the motivations for which are completely identical to those of their most relentless accusers.
Just as many people believe that "Zionists" (a term which seems to have lost its meaning as it has been abused) have a role in the political decisions that are taken, these two, much the same as the JDL, or even the CRIF, believe that every critique, however mundane, has an antisemitic undertone "which is reminiscent of the darkest hours of our history because the womb from which the vile beast emerged is still fertile, my fair lady, it is as if we have returned to 19th-century Russia! ".
It is worth pointing out that the stupid and unbelievable theories by Karsenty on Charles Enderlin's report are still more stupid that those on September 11th.
And God knows that the conspiracy theories on September 11th are disgustingly stupid.
And this fella has political responsibilities; that is extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy of the conspiracy theory of September 11th, we can talk of cognitive dissonance for understanding how the topic is addressed.
Completely blinded by a really bizarre truth; having spent a lot of time, and lots of money supporting this, it is unbearable for followers of this theory to detach themselves from it (just as is the case for religious extremists).
By following logic and inevitably changing paths for the better, the end justifies the means, even the lying, which is the last straw, but which doesn't seem to disturb the work of those concerned.
You advise people to pay attention and not to categorize everyone as being the same, but that is what you are doing with regard to September 11th.
There are still loads of questions that have not been answered on this event, and Bush/Cheney/the Saudis/consorts don't seem to be in a rush to answer them.
Indeed, there are some very bizarre theories, but the official theory is also bizarre, at least in some respects.
Oh nothing's fun anymore....
Health NGO and public health advocate find survey results highly supportive of their advocacy issues.
And, of course, they'll need more grants to follow up!!
Just as smoking was socially acceptable 50 years ago and now is seen for what it really is, alcohol will also have it's day in the full light of reason where the true damage it does to our society will be laid bare.
Now to just wait for all the people to attack me...
Well it's easy to just say stuff, like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the increase", but takes (slightly) more effort to produce actual facts.
Sorry if you take this an attack - perhaps have a drink and relax?
Better risk that than risking my mental health by abstaining.
The Govt stops any pleasure when it costs them money .
Here's some more alarmist advice based on flimsy statistics.
Surely two standard drinks a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, which the first quote states increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should put their heads together (maybe over a relaxing drink or two, but definitely not three) and think up a number on which both can agree - whether or not it has any sound grounding.
Now to tax the fuck out of them like we do for smokers!
they already do - next will be pot .
My father did not drink or smoke and cancer got him at 64.
So I am going to keep up my two bottles of red on friday and saturday nights (and other nights when the mrs ain't around)
Why has the cancer council encourage children going to places where they serve alcohol This is old news which the cancer council deliberately ignored
What is not linked to a cancer risk these days???
Sharks don't get cancer - they eat anything but they are boring to be around .
Sharks do get cancer: skin cancer.
The incompetency of Charlie Whiting has been a recurrent issue for many years.
Don't let him race when we could race, and each other.
Completely agree!
Whiting is Bernie's yes man.
Both of them have ruined F1 for us on the pretext of security.
Let's hope that he gets out of it better than Schumi or less worse than Wendlinger after his accident in 1994.
I completely agree with you, but be careful with regard to point 1: it is not F1, but rather the circuit authorities who refused to bring the start forward as not to mess up the slot time for the TV broadcast.
Exactly, +1
I would just like to wish Jules Bianchi a prompt and quick recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe, 2007, the authorities have failed to appear from between the cranes and F1 has had a series of near misses.
We knew that this would happen one day, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, has said it for years.
How the hell could the race organizers and the FIA have allowed these maneuvers without getting the safety car out?
I can only say that we invoke the risks of the job otherwise it is just bad luck when we do not avoid the foreseeable.
Well, this accident has already happened.
Nevertheless, it has to be said that there was a yellow flag, which doesn't just mean "no overtaking in the section"; the main purpose of it is to signal danger.
This is not shameful, it is fortunate for the family who must have been in front of the telly.
Even with a yellow flag, the drivers are only going to raise their foot.
When conditions are uncertain, the bend can be a lot more hazardous on the next lap, and the driver, who thinks he has approached it with enough leeway, can even take it at a "reduced" speed compared to normal.
Ok, well, we are a bit blind here; as we have not seen the pictures, we cannot give a clear opinion.
I don't really see what that changes.
Is anyone hurt??
According to the CBC, there were no reported injuries.
The CBC ran this story this morning before this happened, which makes one wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there are still jobs in which one is expected to be on call 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are injured people since Canada is pretty much empty.
There might be some injured animals like bears, racoons, etc.
Hope this is tongue in cheek.
Parts of Vancouver have some of the highest densities of population in North America and the Greater Toronto Area has at least six million people.
Trains don't just derail in rural Saskatchewan, and these type of trains often pass through busy urban areas.
Almost every Canadian town and city has a railway going through it, and trains rumble through many, many times a day.
Also, because the tracks often follow water in areas where there are lakes, rivers and ocean, they also pass through areas that are densely populated, as people always want to live by water.
As well, all train traffic goes through the center of a town / city as that was central to the original construction of the railways here.
You may have been trying to be funny, but there is horrific potential for rail disasters across Canada.
Mansbridge did a story on this last night, truly shocking.
Obviously you didn't read the piece about the train derailment and explosion in a Quebec town that killed 47 people?!
Actually you are partially correct.
The City of Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad as well.
That being said, when the railways were built, they went through the centre of the established communities as that was the most direct and central.
Perhaps some employees from the Canadian National Railway Company need attend the upcoming Dangerous Goods Conference in Calgary, Canada on December 2nd & 3rd 2014.
CN employees take extensive training in the handling of dangerous goods.
This article, as well as many of the comments, skips over the primordial religious question: a religion is revealed truths, and for its followers no other truths exist.
That is where the whole problem is, and the exegeses of theologians only reinforce this fact, otherwise what is the point in talking about the sex of angels?
"God said: this is good - this is bad" > that is not compatible with democracy; that is what we call a dictatorship (in other words: theocracy).
The words of a leader (Muslim country but that is irrelevant): "But without religion, how would you control the people?" .
In other words: obey the vicar, priest, pastor, rabbi, imam and say your prayers, everything will be better!
As pointed out below, (Nowak): problem resolved in 1905 after 40 years of fighting between vicars.
May you be touched by His Noodely Appendage.
Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre, who in some way tried to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has cults: that of the strong Euro (which is rather bleak at the moment) or that of the free market (which is reasonably supported by the State when it needs bailing out) etc.
Big ideas that have come from religious uprisings.
Yes, but above all, where there is no difference between a clergyman and a non-believer.
Where rationale is present, the clergyman tags along behind and expresses himself in schism.
Religion was born as an idealogical medium of the State, and the gods were used to offer ambition, even if that in itself led to some forms of dispute.
Theology, when it is torn between fidelity in the form of a revelation and adaptation to the zeitgeist, is not familiar with the concept of doubt.
Fanaticism is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".
That does not withstand the analysis of the texts that are full of explicit calls for hatred towards the infidel.
It is more the moderate religions (and fortunately there are more of them) that "incorrectly read" the texts, and which only hold on to what is revealed about humanism and the common values shared by all of humanity, atheists and divers believers.
For me, fanaticism is the foolish and nasty application of passages of sacred texts, which have been taken out of context.
In this way, some verses of the Qur'an, those which call for the "non-believers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" and "Christians" to be killed, are beyond understanding and are therefore unacceptable if you do not read a few verses before or after, which explain that these executions can only be justified in cases where Muslims are being attacked, killed and are in a situation that requires legitimate defense.
Yves Petit: "with regard to the "scarf", it is prescribed by religion, and nowadays is almost a form of unanimity among the followers".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive to be drawn from this is that it has drawn such widespread condemnation.
More so in Australia
Aren't you guilty of the same prejudice displayed in the clip?
Bunch of over-paid and over-sexed Neanderthal knuckle-draggers.
They have abused humanity enough!
WTF have they ever given us except abuse us with Neighbours, Young Doctors, Home and Away, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Young Einstein, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, The Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tazmanian Devil and fucking Skippy!
A fucking insult to our intelligence, thats what!
If you tear your head away from the television for one moment you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage starting with cave and ]rock paintings of it's indigenous peoples which is still an inspiration for modern artists today.
Then there is the Sydney Opera House and a national opera company which has produced such wonderful singers as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australian include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only one insulting your intelligence is you with your ignorance
Russell Crowe is from New Zealand, the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence certainly needs insulting!
I beg to differ.
Sox doesn't need any help whatsoever in that department.
How did i guess this would be a "Whitey" !
Another George Lazenby fan.
Nice to meet you!!!
But, who is Mari√© Jego?
The biggest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The best.
I miss her articles so much.
She understands Putin through and through, as well as those who support him.
Go and see Leviathan at the cinema and you will understand things better!!
Nice attempt, Savantcosi!
But maybe you still do not know that Kastals is only a little telegraphist from Moscow, and that is the only thing he has to do during the day.
We left him for one month and when we came back he was still chopping up the same salad.
Almost all of the 331 people who have died since the ceasefire were civilians from Donbass, victims of bombings by the army due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
Presenting responsibilities in a hypocritical way, as suggested in the article, without even daring to go as far as explicitly naming the separatists, is in NATO policy, and le Monde does not hesitate to switch facts and responsibilities in order to keep the tall story about the kind, pro-European neo-nazis that are bravely facing up to the nasty Russians
@SavantCosinus: change your browser.
I can open this page fine with firefox and on mac.
If I understand what you are saying, the nasty people are the SS in Ukraine, and the nice people are the Russian Stalinists. Are you not a little bit communist by any chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote referring to MH17: "this bill has absolutely no intention of implying that the pro-Donestsk resistance is innocent".
The Defense Minister of the Russian Federation said himself that Ukraine is responsible.
Propaganda?
To Alexandre Kastals: where did you get these grim figures from?
From the Ukrainian army (they unfortunately lose soldiers almost every day, so they say)?
Uncontrolled elements (likely to mean anything)?
GOOOOO ROMANIA!
Gooooooooooooooo Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with an ethinc Hungarian wife, mind you.
That said, I can't support Piturca's team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers that be, which kept degrading Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperativa", which decided before the season started which team wins the championship, which teams go to Europe, which are relegated, and laundered money at will, mostly from selling players grossly undervalued.
Gica Popescu, former Barcelona captain, was doing business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), later paid them, but, apparently he was ill advised by his lawyers, refused to admit in Court to any wrongdoing (which would've meant a condemnation with no time served), and got 3 and a half years in prison as a result.
The trial also meant prison time for the Becali brothers, four club owners, steaua's manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for football related offenses.
George Becali is also serving time for attempting to bribe (and later cover up) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, in order to win the title and get the jackpot from the Champions League.
The team he tried to bribe were our noisy neighbours from Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 at their stadium, a result that meant we were the first champions from Cluj, while they got relegated.
I still relish that moment.
In the cover up attempt of that bribe was involved, amongst others, Piturca, who signed as a witness a forged document that implied the money the police confiscated in Cluj were meant for a land transaction.
So that lying, cheating, dumb, uneducated creep does not represent me, and never will.
Hungary are a bunch of nationalistic douchenozzles these days.
You might think that after last time they broke chairs in the stadium and windows shops and put up racist banners on the street they wouldn't get any tickets this time around, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take over at Al-Ittihad
Wherever he ends up will be a disappointment, after Stockport County turned him down.
Great article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done that, we would have heard the left screaming like mad.
But, it is the nice Mr Hollande, a friend of the trade unions and the small people, so we hear a little bit of protest, but only a little bit
That is why the business circles sometimes prefer it when a party claiming to be on the left gets into power.
It's the bankers who have financed the victory of Obama, and they have not been disappointed with their investments!
"The absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
The job center should be generalizing control over the unemployed at the start of 2015?
I hope that, while they are at it, the financial department is also going to generalize the absolute control of the idiots commonly known as plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax avoiders, robbing bosses and other crooks.
Do you know how to write a sentence without using the words banksters or plutocrats?
You seem to be very faithful to your jargon all the time
It's true. When you are classy: you consider the population to be illiterate and toothless
Every time there is a new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications which I write to employers, who, more often than not, don't even send confirmation of receipt, not even an automated one.
It is also the complete absence of a follow-up and support from the job center.
To conclude, I will add that the name "socialist" attached to this government appears to me to be an insult to the memory of Jaur√®s or Mend√®s France.
Have we read an article from the Canard Enchain√© here?
We have learned that an unemployed person can go for several months without hearing from their center, but that he must continue to look for work on his own.
We have learned that the checks done have made it possible to strike off people who, in more than half of the cases, did not receive unemployment benefits anymore.
We must, therefore, ask ourselves how these checks can be done on people that we never see.
We must ask ourselves what sanctions would come from stopping someone from accessing the job center's services and unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform is going to allow us to strike more people off, then we must ask ourselves how that is going to help in terms of recruitment.
"We have learned that an unemployed person can go for several months without hearing from their center, but that he must continue to look for work on his own". Indeed, this is shameful.
You have to ask the question, why are these countries in the EU when clearly the authorities aren't able to stand up for European ideals of equality?
It's not like Spanish or Italian authorities have done much about racism in football either?
Should we kick them out of the EU?
The EU was originally and should only be economic.
It's not about being the "thought police."
The EU is a peace project.
It doesn't make economic sense.
Thats probably why Britain will leave the EU soon: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
East European teams are permanently screwed by the referees of the corrupt mafia UEFA.
Best solution is all the East to leave this rotten $$$ organisation and create own.
At least there we will watch some football at last.
This anti racism crusade is only a screen, to cover the injustice and corruption!
No its not.
Currency and business, that's it.
European ideals of equality?
Then what's Europe doing allowing the UK in?
Uefa should act by giving them a huge round of applause for guessing the charade that is played out by Blatter and the boys
This is happening all over the place over the last few years, and I am not exaggerating.
This from the Guardian a couple of days ago:
Is that what he would hope to see, little symmetric sentences, the history of maintaining the controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every time something happens for peace, there has been, is and will be people who add fuel to the fire.
Decoding would mean saying that Western countries are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that that itself explains why these States have never done anything against the State of Israel.
Decoding would mean saying that for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, we must act against the State identifying itself as Israel, which is overarmed, and is an occupying, besieging destroyer, oppressor and colonizer.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine, to the detriment of the Arab population that had nothing to do with the Holocaust, it would have been more reasonable to remove the German inhabitants of Bavaria (those who were guilty of the Holocaust) and replace them with the Jews that survived.
That would have been justice, the Germans did not have a claim over anything, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Sir, let's take the colonization of the Western Sahara as an example.
It's obvious, let Morocco be the colonialist!
But, as for Israel, if you want the truth, you need to also look at its history, its allies and the support it had.
Colonialism, whichever one that be, has never been altruistic, we agree there.
So, stop going out of your way to support the idea that Israel is a colonizer.
Gaul was colonized by the Romans, but there is currently no discrimination between the decedents of the Romans, the Gauls or anyone else.
In Palestine, discrimination exists depending on one's origins.
Elsewhere, the State of Israel defines itself as a State for the "Jewish people", of which no non-Jew can be part.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jews, hence the dispute.
Conclusion: to solve the conflict, we need to move away from Zionism, which causes Jews and non-Jews to be opposed to each other.
In the Maghreb, certain peoples have even been baptized in the name of their premier status by this life-saving civilization!
Two realities that we have to stop ignoring.
Firstly, the European Zionist Project (colonize/take over Palestine), which involves getting rid of the Palestinians. It was, therefore, intrinsically an anti-Palestinian project. As such, the solution requires a break away from Zionism.
Secondly, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay lacked a bit of bite, upfront.
Their lacklustre result will give them something to chew on.
He should begin his rehabilitation with small mouthfuls.
I hope he hasn't lost his appetite for the game.
We tolerate so much nonsense, including racial abuse and strong physical tackles in football but came down too harshly on Suarez.
I would love to see him back in England, irrespective of what purists say.
Yes, I hate all this molarising.
Football is a contact sport where tackles are made and yes as a consequence players will get injured.
The embedding of ones teeth into the flesh of an opponent to gain advantage clearly has no part in the game.
A rugby was banned for 80 matches for comitting a similar offence.
Suarez has now done this on 3 occasions.
If you bit someone at work.
What do you do think the consequences would be?
I knew someone would bite.
If you're dyslexic I forgive you..
I am slighty dyslexic as it happens.
I forgive the cheap sarcasm.
I bet he was chomping at the bit to get back playing
All these Suarez puns are a bit long in the tooth now
i almost took the bite then...
One vital component of a good education is respect from the students towards their teachers and the educational institution.
That works if the parents instill respect in their children.
It is easier for the parents to pass this respect on if they themselves also feel respected by the teachers and their children's school.
In good establishments, those which encourage their students to grow, parents are thought of as partners, and not as ahem..
Who would believe that it is the teacher who should do all of the work (teach, educate, teach respect, limits, how to live together etc.). It is up to parents to do at least 50% of the work.
But, without doubt, it is easier to take it out on the school.
Relying on parents isn't working.
No one has really taken it all upon themselves.
Then, action will remain limited.
On the other hand, the educational institution could do many things.
Operational solutions can be found there.
Is it not necessary for the stakeholders (the teachers, line managers and the ministry) to do their part and not to just take the easy way out?
We could wind up as troops that retreat ready to attack again, rather than families.
How not to talk about education.
It is true that communication lessons enable you to pull the wool over someone's eyes.
We are making out as if we have to train the teachers, but we are forgetting what the primary role of a school is.
To pass on knowledge.
And if there are to be demands from parents, then it should be that the school assures them of their child's teaching.
Which Minister will dare to bring back what we called Public Education?
Disappointing article: little information and incomplete and unstructured criticism.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from that eastern suburbs bogan?
He's a Bogan alright, but I think he's actually a Willoughby Bogan, hence North Shore...
Sloppy Joe does not understand numbers.
He refuses to accept facts.
No wonder we have a Budget Emergency.
Dump him and the economy will brighten up immediately.
Hunters Hill actually
bloody dead right
That's right.
Aloysius boy.
His electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
Indeed North Shore Bogan!!!
Well, if any British BBC viewers wanted to compare our two countries' neocon governments, they would definitely come to the conclusion that both were run by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers Party.
He comes across as pretty grumpy, nowadays. :(
Yeah, well his leader hangs him out to dry pretty regularly.
You'd be pretty grumpy too if you woke up to the realisation that you will never obtain the position of PM and all those lifetime lurks and perks will be forever beyond your reach.
Poor Old Joe.
Pathetic really.
He made a half-arsed attempt to present a budget and then gave up.
at least he's not threatening to shirtfront anyone
Brittany Ferries needs a new boat.
They will order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and request aid from the State.
And, as they know how to lobby, there is no doubt as to what the result will be.
Too bad for the jobs in France which the company has nothing to do with. A company that originates from farmers is always ready to split when their corporation makes losses in the market, especially foreign markets...
That's precisely right because their lobbying has not worked, only the order has been canceled.
If the company had got a deadline extension or developments for MARPOL, there is no doubt that the project would have succeeded.
Then, to know whether it is good or not, and how BF are going to comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice if "le Monde" looked into this!
The company Brittany Ferries is run by Breton farmers.
Those who burn the tax and social security offices.
They want aid from the State.
The fact that they will not get it seems quite normal to me.
And, well, given that it is 30% more expensive to use the French flag on a boat than it is for any other civilized flag, yes, it is normal to expect a little bit of help from the State.
Or the other option is for us to learn to tolerate the British monopolizing the market.
That's the choice.
An everlasting problem with the French, who consider their maritime facade to be a destination for tourists and not an area of activity where people who are different from the average Parisian sometimes live.
This difference has a daily cost, lack of investments, and short-lived desires.
One of the reasons why Brittany has to regain its sovereignty.
Exactly, and then they will create a Breton flag and have their own crew, which is made up solely of Bretons born and bread.
With that, it is certain that they are going to reduce costs significantly...
Of course.
Sadly it's what we've come to expect from the BBC.
They're always hated all things prog, so it's hardly surprising they've chosen to overlook Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the spirit of 70s Genesis than that of any of the other members of the band.
Hackett was to Genesis what Malcolm Young was to AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important he was to the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To be fair they hardly mentioned gabriels solo work either.
I hardly think that the BBC can be accused of "hating all things prog", given that they've just aired a 1¬Ω hour documentary on one of the greatest ever prog bands.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about Genesis the band, not about the members' solo projects.
As for Hackett's solo career being "closer to the spirit of 70s Genesis", I don't agree.
Hackett is no more entitled to go on the road, play a load of Genesis songs that he had varying degrees of hand in writing and claim an affinity to Genesis than David Gilmour is entitled to pull together a load of half-finished demos and call them a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I don't think Steve Hackett is asking for more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
Banks' first solo album A Curious Feeling is absolutely brilliant, and very much in the spirit of 70s Genesis.
They have overlooked Hacketts solo career because it, lets be honest, sucks.
Yes they are one of the greatest prog bands but would the documentary have been made if they didn't have their poppy commercial success in the 80s?
I have yet to see the BBC do a feature length documentary on bands like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have just as interesting a history but lack the mainstream appeal that Genesis has.
Good points.
Though I'd say the BBC have 'always' hated the fact that they used to LOVE progressive music back in the day.
Person with vested interest shouts "bias": of course he does.
More of the Jonathan King interview on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to repeat one horrible act by committing another horrible act (including, sometimes, acts against innocent people), then it is a brilliant success.
There will always be a big difference between a criminal who has been sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal committed his act because of his misconception of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so with the fairest and wisest vision and reflection in society.
That is to say, there is no excuse.
They cannot be defended.
Yes, we understood your point of view the first time.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
You have to be different from the average person to enjoy violence.
That is what the criminal does due to his misconception of things.
But that is also the byproduct of pain, hatred and the conviction and punishment from relatives of the innocent victim: a misconception which will never prevail over those who decide, wisely and based on sound and fair reasoning from their pedestal, on the death of another person.
But, in an attempt to balance the analysis, we could, all the same, argue that being sentenced to death was, usually, savagely violent, and they enjoyed it, and it was generally given to people who were friendly and who bore the costs of it all for nothing.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain fade along with the death of the person who was the killer, sometimes the torturer, of their loved one, and someone who haunts them at night.
Let's not undermine their relief.
Thanks √âmilio for this thought, I find it very fair.
Strong and moving article.
With regard to Marc Asnin, he is proof of great intelligence.
That of the heart.
Without doubt, it is the most fair thing I have read in a long time.
However, you would think from reading stories of passed times, old things, that the inhumanity of the past would be an excuse, well, the dates that stick out are 2009, 2011, 2012...
I don't really think Philip Roth is that great.
Same goes for the other two 'Great American Novelists' mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all vastly overrated.
I thought you were off the white stuff, dude.
What gives?
Roth is great, far greater than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably greater than the tedious Bellow, who did get the prize.
Perhaps the Nobel judges that year decided that if you have to have a US laureate, you may as well have a [mild] racist.
Munro is very great, too.
They all produce 'genius novels' like it was some sort of literary genre.
His namesake Joseph however....
Which ones have you read?
How many DeLillo books have DeLillo dismissers read?
I didn't finish Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
The short stories such as 'Human Moments in World War III'?
White Noise?
The poppier wackier smaller early novels, and their dialogue, are great too.
I don't know if I'll ever finish Underworld.
I just know that if I meet somebody who claims to live in the same word as me and to have read enough DeLillo books to dismiss his talent as a writer, I cannot but help but fear that their favourite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...??
It's a simple question of interests.
It is a joke, "the law", not a request for a definition.
Between the text and the spirit of the text, it seems to be so OBVIOUS that the woman acted in HER own interests, and not at all in those of the institution she was representing. We ought to request what the term "conflict" has to do with this.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope that she pays very, very dearly!
Ah yes, the State services are very practical: they either impede a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not foresee the danger.
Later, we will hear that French workers are not dynamic and are only looking for peace.
It is typical, flood plains suddenly become available for construction overnight just because a large construction program is about to be launched, and not just on low coastlines.
Look at the flood plains near to the rivers.
They said "nowadays, there are no more floods thanks to dams".
We now need to make the reservoirs upstream bigger and cross our fingers.
But that will be because of State services, of course...
Benefit to the land, the whole of the enhancement?
By land.
So, 6 million euros.
Is it clearer now; the interest?
Get the calculator out and you will dream of the life that you would have been able to have instead of Miss Babin, the 1st Deputy of the UMP for La Faute-sur-Mer and the former president of the district planning commission, which grants planning permission!
The 2 victorious elements of Sarkozism are the elderly and real estate.
I am a leftie and not at all a supporter of Sarko, but please, don't play politics or dish out low blows all over the place; we are not fighting each other with stink bombs.
wonder if any of the cops involved in these latest shootings were also involved in these incidents.
USA cops are hardened criminals.
US is a shit hole
So in what shit hole do you live?
USA is not a shit hole.
Yea USA cops are hardened because of the scum they have to deal with on a daily basis.
Of course non of them ever do anything but the cops are "hasseling them because they are racist ".
excuse the pun, but that's a cop out.
Racism is rampant in the US, it's unfortunate that it takes an incident like this to force people to take a closer look at the problem.
your generalization reveals thorough ignorance of the us..
You are the ignorant one here.
Good cops need to denounce racist evil corrupt cops.
TURN THEM IN!
Do the math on that.
that kind of in your face racism doesnt happen here
is this your first time having a conversation?
this is not a conversation, you accuse someone of ignorance when in actuality the cluelessness clearly resides elsewhere - multiple sources (US sources) have noted the ongoing problem with racism in the states (this is not idle speculation).
It's quite probable that you are underestimating the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how high feelings are running on this matter right now.
And thus the line between public service and private security for power and privilege, never very robust, grows ever more insubstantial.
wall street finances the nypd in several ways, hence the treatment of occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some people, and the mistaken naivety of the VA and others shocks me.
And where do you think the investigative journalists find their information?
On the internet?
They go to interrogate the managers, make them talk and stir up secrets.
The fact that the man is going to the Elys√©e is not really surprising.
Then, the thing that counts is cross-referencing, verifying and analyzing.
And in this we know Sarko-supporters have something to worry about.
@Munstead, our current president was elected during a wave of anti-sarkozism, based on ill-founded cases (dismissed case and no sentence imposed) which seem to have been made up by the magistrates (2 referred to the Criminal Court); two journalist friends of Hollande.
If this collusion, which has been revealed between the justice system, politicians, executives and the press, which is not an institution of power, does not shock you, that is because your partisanship is blinding you!
A meeting with Hollande...
And of course, it is just a coincidence and has not been orchestrated. ...
And you think that only Sarkozy's supporters are outraged!
From the bit I managed to read, the VA article suggests that the boot is on the other foot now.
I even laughed, considered how rough it was.
As for the rest, the complaint made by le Monde has little chance of succeeding because the journalists are not "bound" to keep their sources hidden, are they?
The difference is that there does not seem to be a collusion between the VA and those in power, while there does seem to be a collusion between those in power and the journalists working for le Monde to fight against the opposition.
I can't be the only one who is waiting for an explanation from le Monde about this and its dangerous relationships.
We are in the midst of a State scandal, which, in any other democracy, would cause the government involved to collapse.
Hence this editorial in dire straits, which says a lot about the current government's involvement.
It is not a question of the left or the right, it's much worse than that.
I would have thought that sorrell might go quite well with kippers!
This is purely about numbers and driving down wages and creating housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was good because my parents had come here I'd have some reservations about the issue of immigration but it's no reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people on a reason programme on the bbc about immigration was a second generation Sikh who said she felt comfortable about the numbers of people coming in and the changes they were bringing with them, she was paired up with a muslim man who was very unco-operative, refusing even to ladel out portions of soup simply it was associated with the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship even though she assured him he did not have to pray
** 'who said she felt UNcomfortable about'
As we all know left unchallenged the UK will continue to go to the right - anyone that draws a line in the sand to challenge this has to be admired even if he is an ad exec :) Good on you!
More too the right?
Where have you been living?
If this Country was anymore left it would be communist.
In your view, what did New Labour do that was particularly left wing?
The liberalisation of a country, constant NHS this NHS that, mass immigration immigrati( in their words to rub the rights noses in it), benefit culture, the age of self entitlement, political correctness killing freedom of speech.
I understand that Labour is centre left and not communist, that was said in jest, my point is that they socially engineered a very large percentage of the population to be dependant on the state.
Very left wing if you ask me.
Spout your prepared lines as much as you want, but what I asked you for were specific examples of left wing policy, or a left wing agenda being pushed by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With respect that is not what you asked, you asked what, in Daniel Johnson's view did New Labour do which was particularly right wing.
He told you his view, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you were asking for.
Yeah - it's much more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK‚Äôs most powerful advertising executive, conflates the situation of his parents with that of the economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was perfectly right to do so.
France for the French!
We fought 40 to 45 to wind up in another dictatorship, one of money.
We will play happy economics while chucking out these technocrats...
Some would say we need to renegotiate the treaties.
Agreed, let's renegotiate, and if the word "democracy" still means something in Europe, that is what should happen, isn't it?
Curiously, the commission isn't addressing the unfair financial competition between countries and companies.
That has to be a negotiable amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU only has one objective, and that is to make the entire railway sector market-orientated.
In the end, it means that the whole of France will no longer be served by the railways.
Many countries have already fallen victim to such a withdrawal and it will only get worse.
Sacrificing everything, including the future of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa, does not seem like a good idea to me.
The EU is a real problem, which will need to be dealt with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to get all of the SNCF's accounts straight.
The French State resigned a long time ago.
The regions have the impression that they are paying for nothing, but not the means to force the SNCF into respecting its commitments.
Yet using public money without any waste is essential these days, as public resources are under pressure.
And the huge needs.
I don't really understand very well what the TER's competition is!
Does he still have a drink problem?
If so he really shouldn't be working as a scout leader?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to separate out the problems that existed within the marriage and that you are, not unnaturally, still trying to resolve the hurt and anger now it has been over for five years.
Obviously, having an alcoholic ex living in such close proximity and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is galling and very difficult.
That said, it would seem sensible to me to begin a process of separating out your life from the complications that he has left behind.
They seem to be doing this but it seems hostile.
As you are all in such close proximity and complications seem likely to continue and new ones arise have you considered a proper time limited 'plan' of 'escape' so you can separate out your own life and future.
The financial problems are pernicious but with a sympathetic mortgage company, a good solicitor and some pressure from the Courts they can be resolved.
He sounds vindictive and persistent.
What about a Family Case Conference to get it all out in the open and some support for him to get him back working and paying maintenance.
I think this gets to the heart of it.
Your life is so much bigger than the part you shared with your ex.
Really good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they'd like to do, even if that means meeting the new wife.
Tell them that you'll support anything they decide to do.
Warn them he may not keep his promises about contact and ask them to consider how they'll feel about that and how they'll best deal with the dissapiontment if he fails to keep his arrangements.
Try for their sake to maintain some connection to their father.
If they see you're doing this for their benefit, despite your own reasonably held resentment about how he's treated you, then they will respect you.
They'll never lose their love for you and if you do everything to facilitate a continuing parent/ child relationship, they will know who to thank when they get older.
I'm of the belief that children eventually can see where the faults lie, if they're left to see it for themselves.
Come on, a bit more effort, you're almost there, Godwin.
It's over quickly, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, the short term economic interests are powerful, it is David against Goliath.
Furthermore, with globalization, the country that makes the lowest social, fiscal and also environmental tender instantly has a competitive advantage, and the others have to follow suit.
Everything that politicians research is growth, THE growth.
We need international teamwork, but before then...
It is not the climo-skeptics that produce C02.
It is everyone. Those who warm themselves up, those who use air con, those who fly or drive, those who live in housing that had to be built, and those who buy industrial products that need to be manufactured and transported.
It is not the climo-skeptics that have stood up against ecotax, but the truck drivers.
No politician is a climo-skeptic, and Arnold S consumes a lot more than I do.
But no one is saying that climo-skeptics produce more CO2 than everyone else.
Environmentalists also travel to conferences.
The thing is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
We also need political action (other sources of energy, a reduction in the dependency on cars etc.).
And politicians act within their parties and for their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous pledge made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 during his travels to the Philippines.
The Terminator just reused the expression.
But, oh well, maybe it is just funny to say that the expression came from the Terminator.
"Greenhouse gases are harmful", there are 30 definitions of greenhouse, and all of them are different.
Therefore, we don't know what it is, but every good apostle of the AGW dogma seems to know what it is about.
No one knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long will it be before someone blames this on immigration?
I blame it on the bankster who took all the money.
Does the Liberian in Texas count?
You are Rick Perry and I claim my $5
I blame the Liar Dems.
Or the Con Dems.
Or Liarbour.
Whatever, those people whose fault it is.
Population displacement could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or sub clinical cases jumping in a car or plane to flee the epidemic just moved the infection faster than can be imagined.
Sex with monkeys any better?
Think it's a virus?
I don't advise asking for an antibiotic prescription.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Oh dear indeed!
Don't use the word immigration, you'll scare the horses!
The UK is dependent on immigration to pay for all our old age pensions, to look after our old, empty their bedpans, bury the 30,000 each year that die each year with the choice of hypothermia or starvation, (don't forget your woolly hat and jumper, means you can keep warm, turn the heating off AND have that cheese sandwich).
Don't be fcuking stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and onto the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or was it done on purpose?
That's more comfortable...
There you go, that's how public money is being spent, so that a tiny minority of people can have a good time in space, doing somersaults and purring while messing around in front of the television cameras.
Reality TV has not invented anything, and the authorities are surely waiting for a baby to be conceived up there so that it arouses everyone's passion and pleases media coverage of the western monarchy, which is used to tabloid motherhood.
Maybe we need to bring them back down to earth so they can see that we work here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we do not send men or women to space so that they can do somersaults or to fool around, but rather to work.
And the work is very useful for humanity in general.
And that applies to everything.
Many things that improve our daily life have come from space research.
So, yes, money well spent.
Can you name one thing that improves our daily lives that has come from space research.
It is just a huge waste of money.
The ballpoint pen, which uses air (to write on the ceiling, for example)
To pay your bills?
To take part in making the umpteenth useless product?
Or to suggest a way of making more money for investors?
In short, working for the sake of working does not mean anything and is actually a sign of vacuity.
Ah, yes, the latest high-tech toy.
Behind the tiny minority of people who go to space, there are many hundreds and thousands of others who are working to make it possible.
Do you know, some people work, many of whom for private companies so that cargo can be transported to the station.
if you think about buying a plastic gun....
But what about those who are not currently thinking about buying plastic guns but have the potential to do so in future?
They may be the most dangerous of all.
No because the plastic sword was kept as decoration in a private home.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try and fool people into believing it is a real gun for the purpose of a crime.
Plastic swords may be tacky decorations but that's about all.
An extremely dishonest article, would it have strained the writer/editor to have pictured the "sword" in question instead of generic "plastic sword" pics?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the significance (if any) of the writing on it was?
Typical bad reportage, focus on the "its just a plastic sword" and not the inspirational jihadi text written on the thing.
The sword - a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar - is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
Dirani's family are Afghan-born Shiite Muslims, however, the terrorist groups seeking to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslim.
I wish people wouldn't joke about plastic knives being harmless.
In trained hands, they can still be deadly.
Even little take away knives and forks can cut and poke through flesh.
Thanks very much for that, so if its a common decoration then it supports the ridicule the author is putting on it.
No reason to try to make it "ha, ha, plastic sword" at all, the facts as you have stated them actually support his case.
I have seen these decorations in Muslim houses on occasion, or drawn onto the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And it's all falling into place now...
I've witnessed the middle eastern-looking guy at Kebab Stop handing out plastic knives to all-and-sundry all night long!
I really like the conclusion.
All of these marvelous innovations, often technology related, make many people believe that it is a right or a necessity to take advantage of them, but there is an upfront cost, and worse, a staggered price (subscription, electrical consumption) which takes its toll on budgets.
And not being able to take advantage of the new technology leads to frustration.
For example, making use the Energy Solidarity Pact (Pacte Energie Solidarit√© - PES), which enables you to insulate the attic of your home for ‚Ç¨1 if the house is lived in by a couple on a low income (the cost of the work is in fact paid for by the energy providers!).
Simply efficient, but misunderstood, even if more than 3000 houses have been insulated in this way this year!
This PES is interesting.
But never heard it said.
How can you make use of this and how does it work?
Information for 60 million consumers, test showers for their water economy and it is advised that faucets and toilets are fitted with water saving gadgets.
The study found that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) i.e. a saving in water of 50 m3 per year, all with the same amount of comfort.
There is no crisis in terms of demand, it is a crisis in terms of the system, which no longer produces enough surplus (it would then have to redistribute by increasing revenue in real terms) so that the surplus pays for the increase in expenses that you categorize as "unavoidable expense".
In other words, fuel poverty is "just" the other side of the coin, and the fact that the economy is no longer growing as quickly as they would like.
It should be noted that the neo-classical economic theory is completely incapable of answering such a question because, as far as the theory is concerned, there are no intrinsic limits to economic growth, and there is nothing to stop economic growth from getting stronger and stronger, decade after decade.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows all physical transformations to take place.
In the same way that production is fundamentally a form of transformation, energy is what allows the slightest amount of economic output (goods or services).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
That means that any increased constraint on obtaining energy (incorrectly called energy "production"), even by increasing the cost, is a constraint, in turn, on the level of production (except for improving energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency also requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not that expensive).
In short, there is a very strong link between fuel poverty and the fact that we are, or are not, increasing the "production" of cheap energy.
And very official public data, for example, from the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only get worse in the years and decades to come (the IEA, in its recent reports, clearly states that in 2008 we reached a peak in the production of conventional oil, meaning cheap oil.
Yet oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very strong energy density, the ease with which it can be transported, manipulated and stored, and the range of its possible uses etc.)
Three points, great stuff regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we got nothing so evens itself up.
Get tae France!
Vote No on the 18th.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As has been remarked before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Indeed, well done to them.
Although many English people do enjoy laughing at the Scotch when they keep failing, there is no denying that they bring a bit of colour to tournaments on the odd occasion they actually qualify, at least until they get knocked out in the first round.
It's especially fun if we get to play them;)
England are starting to worry me.
Because, now the 'golden shige generation' are being decommissioned they might actually have a reasonable team with all these youngsters.
Ferdinand , D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the starting XI, why change a winning formula?
The only English footballer in my drunk opinion who has been 'world class' genuinely so, is David Beckham, a ponce, maybe, but I think if he ever tackled an over weight spuds like me, he would crush my entire being.
People forget about his athleticism, speaking of sporting athleticism, Wayne Rooney....?
I never laugh at the scotch.
I tend to find myself staring wistfully into its warm colours towards the end of an evening....
The only English footballer in my drunk opinion who has been 'world class' genuinely so, is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to overlook that he was, at his peak, a really, really good player.
Surely Juppe would find it difficult to ask for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not sure that he would get it if he asked for it...
You mean that people are coming to have a good laugh?
As for the rest, I would be surprised to hear that B Debre, for example, only lives on MP allowances...
I personally wonder what he has to say in his conferences.
How can we reduce the deficit?
How can we return to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker within the scientific domain, whatever his level of scientific knowledge, even if he has been awarded the Nobel prize, would think of asking for money.
Conferences with such content are free, or close to free, most of the time.
And I can assure you that these young people, who are genuinely working, and the results they present in their conferences - for free - are genuine.
In a time when budgetary restrictions are being placed on research, bringing these two figures together is enlightening.
Research conferences are paid for by the labs!!!
That's saying something...
It all became clear to me.
They are watching the sun.
So, N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the UMP's ethics
I have the impression that we are criticizing him for earning money???
I am far from being one of his fans but criticizing him for badly (or deceptively) running his campaign, OK.
But, giving conferences seems to me to be a completely legitimate thing to do.
Just to add to the comment by Nina, let's remember that his travel is paid for by the taxpayer.
Epidemiology rule 1: Isolate.
All UK & US flights to / from Africa should have halted weeks ago.
Human life is more important than political correctness.
It's in Spain, GB, Texas & other possibles.
At what population infection density do the politicians find enough spine to make the correct call?
So if I want to get from Africa to the UK I fly to Spain, then fly from Spain to the UK.
If ebola gets a lot worse in West Africa I can see them banning all flights and ships into the UK.
We would still need to ship in goods though...
What a shame that the international media panic about ebola is not used more to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises facing west africans.
We are ALL threatened.
In every corner of the earth, male, female, This is such a sad piece of journalism, such a weak headline to grab onto.
I could go through every paragraph and substitute Men in some other (equally relevant) context : Women are the primary care givers - read - Men travel between communities , etc, etc.
So much more intelligent comment could have been made about how, why and where we all can contribute to better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches and differences in gender roles that could actually help combat ebola in West Africa.
Let's get with it and think and write, not just beat a drum.
There is a moment for everything.
If you are not capable of offering good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just sit and think before you write?
While I would rank female genital mutilation as a form of decapitation - an equally barbaric form of terrorism, its survivability making it only a different form of torture, pointing out its temporary suspension as a "silver lining to a very dark cloud" beggars belief.
BTW - I can see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which may to some offer "validity' of opinion, but in this case obviously it does not necessarily make for any better perspective than the average activist in the street.
And I thought the Guardian was 'growing up" as a global resource of journalism - moving along in the 21st century from its original founding precepts.
Who in the editorial team is letting this get through to publication?
Money doesn't matter to a locally, or any other, elected person.
I have always read that public sector services are increasing their numbers, and I have never seen an article in which they are given a chance to comment or attempt to explain why.
That would, of course, be legitimate.
There will be, without doubt, both lies and truths, and we will have to separate the grain from the chaff.
The Court of Auditors is expensive and all you get out of them is economic nonsense.
It is safe to say that they have never had to manage the people in rue Cambon.
The CTs don't have a deficit, they need financing, which may refer to, and only refer to, the investments they make.
By using very vague concepts, the press, such as le Monde, is playing into the hands of obscurantism.
Debt is beneficial because it funds investment and collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly funds operating costs...
And as there are more officials than are needed (to make beautiful roundabouts for example) this causes a growing burden that cannot be reduced (compulsory burden until they die, because work for life and retirement), and these communities reduce investments.
We, therefore, have to abolish the status of civil servants prior to the decline of allowances.
And also make mayors aware of their financial responsibilities.
It is fabulous, those who intercommunicate would have had to be accompanied by a reduction in the workforce, and yet the opposite is taking place, proof that adding in certain levels is not effective unless others are removed.
How do you manage large regions properly as if they were small when we are living in the age of the TGV and cars?
The age of the horse, when these regions were created, has long gone, now is perhaps the time to act.
No, it seems they would prefer to stay locked in, or even worse, stuck in the administrative backdrop!
Try being stopped, it's not too hard to explain what it's like, and this is the situation the Fifth Republic has come to be in with its providential men.
This all really started with P√©tain.
And then it continued to lead to the series "breathless" which arrived in a timely manner.
Why don't they just go and live in a 250 million dollar apartment in Monaco above a cinema and leave all that suffering behind?
Europe is built also on a graveyard, it will be a long and painful process.
When will these people learn to look after themselves.
Don't both with the, "It's all the white man's fault" replies.
"bother" not "both"
I sincerely hope you're being sarcastic.
I was in my earlier post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That is what happens when one is in a hurry to be firs.
Whether you are being sarcastic or not, there is a point to be made.
It's now widely accepted that modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North Eastern Africa around 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period around 150 thousand years ago they were able to travel North into the Middle East and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is history.
The current Minister of Defense declared a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So, he lied.
Without a doubt he is the only one in the government who is staying on course.
From now on, we know that we can't trust him any more.
Resignation!
In 2017: conversion to a comfortable town house made with gold cupboards for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving out of the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val de Grace was a symbol in the past, medicine for the affluent classes and their families, the "Grand V" care and three tiers of medicine.
We are going to save some money and the military are going to treat the baby's flu elsewhere...
Did you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all walks of life?
London Wasps?
Feel sorry for their Wycombe/London based fans.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They dropped the "London" bit last season.
It's just "Wasps" now.
A franchise by any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles eh?
Makes a change for a football team to be using the grounds of a rugby club instead of the other way round.
Also the away trips for Tigers and Saints will be a lot easier.
No it doesn't.
We at Stockport County had the misfortune to be acquired by Sale Sharks, and end up having to rent our own stadium from them once we had regained our independence.
I was about to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the pitch, despite having access to other facilities, did is no favours whatsoever.
I love supporting Coventry City.
It's just one good news story after another.
there's always the option of Coventry United now
It must be galling for a fairly well-supported team, who until not too long ago were in the top flight for over 30 years, to have their stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of CCFC's recent problems but this must be a real slap in the face.
Not a follower of club rugby myself, and to be honest don't really know anyone who is apart from a couple of Wasps fans at work.
Surely they and a few thousand other people in the South East will either follow them from afar or have to upport another team now?
A beautiful article for the home, and some good popularization.
But who is worried about it?
Well, why aren't ALL IT systems based on these concepts???
Because a huge amount of programs already exist (cobol, java), and because not all systems need them, and because there is no magic wand....
And because, for the majority of IT systems, bugs are not really that important, what is important is being the first person.
The works of G.

But these sell.
Real time IT has become a key sector in many domains, and there are not many people who know the intimate details of these processes.
I have not used an Olive Garden in about 15 years.
It became poor value for money.
I'm sorry for the people who will lose their jobs but it beats closing the business.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices which are known to be popular.
Reduce costs and prices.
Already far too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask them to hold the salt at Olive Garden in the future.
Seems to be all about, Lets wring some more profit out of this, nothing about Lets make the food more healthful and better value.
What fools they take us for.
Oh yes, make sure people dont get too many bread sticks.
And lets outsource the soup, it's better mass produced anyway.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, makes up for real ingredients.
Better add some monosodium glutamate too
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible but it makes a significant improvement to the taste of the final product.
It's not just the taste of the salt, it also affects how the pasta cooks.
The final product is so much better.
There is no food without salt.
Everyone should consider alternatives to corporate cuisine.
Are family owned restaurants available and do they provide a reasonably priced and tasty meal?
What has happened in the USA is sad actually.
An everyday accident at work that took a turn for the worst.
A promising young thief in training, following his father's career in prison for murder.
A man who has spoiled everything and brutally interrupted this birth calling.
I hope he is sentenced to 10 years in prison, which seems to be the minimum sentence.
Where else would we go?
Completely agree!
How funny!
The urge to have a go is obvious, and it's difficult to excuse, but is also blameworthy, all at the same time...
Indeed, the urge to have a go is hard to excuse.
That's why I am sympathetic of the 15 year old kid to a certain extent.
During the trial the kid's dad complained about never seeing his son again, but never once asked for forgiveness from the relatives of the lad who he himself had killed.
Who is the real victim in this story?
What are you getting all mixed up in!!!?
The kid's dad was sentenced for what he did.
With regard to the stupid stray bullets, the accused and culprit knew full well that bullets are dangerous.
The kid did nothing at all to the accused!
I hope he pays for the crime for which he is responsible!
10 years, that's a bit much in my opinion.
Having had the intelligence to fire towards this youngster to make a noise?
It certainly did make a noise!
If you get the chance go for a holiday in the Mosul valley and stay in one of the small wine grower's B&B.
Have done this twice now, fantastic wine, scenery and food.
Plus if you are there during the numerous wine festivals held by each town, even better.
Sorry Mosel valley, rushed spelling
Nice to see a little justice done to German wines.
A rather important point is that German vintners traditionally use only one variety of grape, which means they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some of the younger generation are now experimenting with several types of grape, along the lines of France, Italy &c.
Not only the Mosel region is to be recommended - Franconia, the Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden are all well worth a visit.
An interesting region in France is Alsace, this being a sort of cross-over between Germany and France.
The wines are very much in the German style (or perhaps it is the other way round, whatever).
Germans prefer beer.
They traditionally drink wine after the meal.
Knowing the world's liking for dry whites with the meal, they now offer plenty, with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9degrees.
But their traditional wines estate-bottled are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Volrads spatlese with lobster thermidor next time you're round the chippy.
See Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had a restaurant.
Hugh Johnson's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide beautifully illustrated.
I appreciate that there will be new Guardian readers coming to wine anew, but this is a rehash of every single piece about German wines in the paper since the old King died.
Every so often there's a piece about how German wines are just about to happen, new Baden drys will now go with food, the reds are surprisingly vigorous, but most of all they're not those nasty liebfraumilchs that people drank in their youth (um, I genuinely don't think that's still true or resonant, unless this is being addressed to the over-40s - whom, as I say, will have seen all this before).
Closing the Val de Gr√¢ce would be a huge mistake and a sign of the pathetic state of which the French administration is part.
It is a crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the side for my great-grandfather and great great uncle who did their studies there.
In a democracy, public health has to be put to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these arguments among ministers, who do nothing but scratch each other's backs and make decisions behind closed doors, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is correct.
We will have to do what they did in Soylent Green: euthanasia at the age of 70.
What's more, we could resell the meat. That will feed our poor active poor (sic) since they can no longer be put on to the market.
In reality, find a job for the unemployed, a real job, and you wouldn't have deficit problems any more!
For older people, the time has come to pay a little bit more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The ones in work, close to death, will not be able to survive this demographic transition all by themselves...
So, geriatrics, of course, but think about it differently, rather than as a hospital model from the glorious thirty.
From now on, the maximum growth rate of 1.5% (this has been the case for the last 30 years) for the next 50 years is something that is going to force us to reevaluate the entire post-war model!
The Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in the field of medicine in France: a certain rigor and discipline which is best known within public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we are all really fucked.
We are fucked anyway because all the other hospitals are not on a par with it.
The scandal here is that presidents and other members of the elite look after other things rather than public hospitals.
The answer lies more in increasing the amount of services offered to the public in other hospitals rather than holding on to a two-tier health system.
The Val is a center of excellence for French medicine and, of course, a symbol.
Closing it would be a mistake, yet another sign of France moving closer towards mediocrity.
No talk of its military status, which absolutely must be preserved.
"The daily cost of being hospitalized", the hospital management unit, is decided by the minister with the local supervision of the Regional Hospital Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Well, I mean, obviously the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to get a better paid job than the one he had back home.
In almost all countries around the world, a child born in that country with two non-citizens parents is almost always a non-citizen.
Australian goes further than most countries in making the children of residents Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticised for not meeting some impossibly high standard, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why is this???
It seems to be an unfair double standard.
Send Abbot to ME, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to stop all the persecution and abuse and war that cause people to flee their countries and seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people coming on boats then solve the problems that generate this traffic.
Nothing to complain about living in Sri Lanka now.
The civil war lasted for 26 years, tens of thousands were killed by both sides.
This is what happens in civil wars.
However, the war finished 6 years ago and the place is getting back to normal
All starting to make sense now, nimrod..!
Odd that David Cameron UK Prime Minister didn't believe that little furphy when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbott....
Cameron decried the war crimes and the abuses that were still occurring.
Several European countries have since suspended deportations of Tamils with connections to the LTTE, finding them to be at risk of torture on return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines on assessing asylum claims in December 2012, and recommended that persons with certain links to the LTTE be regarded as being at risk on return.
The year [2013] saw an escalation in attacks by militant Buddhist groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were conducted in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr Nowak has gone crazy will all this news.
In fact , this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have an health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't haven been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah ah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is now even less: they told us that Ebola was killing people so quickly that it is impossible for there to be a wide-spread epidemic (there is a lot of scientific literature on this topic, with models and everything).
Then they told us that the risk of contracting the disease from the people they have brought back is zero.
Strange, the more they reassure us, the more scared I am.
You should read the newspapers for fun if you want to believe the risk is zero.
Slim, very slim, but not zero.
Well, it is a scientific fact, the more quickly a virus becomes fatal (in general), the lower the chances of it spreading because the death of its host causes its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and quick death) can happen sometimes, e.g. the Spanish influenza.
Other than that, it is general quarantine that will save humanity. ..
Is there not something obscene about the clear, good and virtuous medical advances made in the west, but to the detriment of thousands of ill Africans, whose occupation, bravery and virtues we know nothing about?
Of course, that highlights the work carried out by NGOs and encourages us to help them, but repeating the news is terribly biased.
freedom of speech, so beloved by conservatives
the suspension was about keeping doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers in arms attacking Australians‚Äô freedom of speech and privacy.
I bet they never thought their conservative leanings would lift their rights to freedom of speech.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one who won't next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less available health professionals in the face of a potential health crisis.
A practice run for when the issue really gets out of hand.
There are not enough doctors working in regional areas around Australia as it is.
Tony Abbotts refusal to be involved with the "war" on ebola, illustrates his philosophy to medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Future Fund, set to reach $20 billion by 2020 will, no doubt, just be a budget emergency slush fund.
Using the pretext of worthy medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at some later date, transfer these funds into general revenue.
Hope Australian voters can see through this clever ruse.
Tony Abbott is more clever than we give him credit.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Medical Research Future Fund.
However, it's a loss to the sick, a loss to the elderly and a loss to low income earners.
It may be very clever, but it's not fair.
Well he did have an excellent tutor in the lying rodent and his Future Fund from Telstra.
If its not fair then lets show Abbott who is clever.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine was "the former personality", lovely....
I noticed that as well, quite a harsh comment.
If only that could dissuade her from talking about herself all the time..
The worst fate for a politician at the end of their career: not being recognized on the streets.
Hello, she was not recognized in her hometown of Toul, which was enough to get rid of her.
How exactly is "provincial" a good thing!
We live in horrible times, Miss Morano.
I am, of course, against the wearing of a burka, but that is not the issue.
The message behind this story is Sarkozism through and through: the tiny, modest people having the power of a minister, confusion between the function of government and how it is run (if he could, Sarkozy would come back with his tonfa on every road traffic accident just to show that he is the guardian of public order); rudeness and presumptuousness to the maximum.
I suggest we give Morano, Sarkozy and all of these "former personalities", who have become idle, the right to carry a firearm and a badge of honor, so they will have all the time in the world to exercise their self-proclaimed role as upholders of the law.
Who is Nadine Romano anyway?
Indeed, the main lesson learned from this whole thing is: even the police have made a fresh start with Sarkozy, and maybe they will not regret it.
He really needs to stop before this gets embarrassing for him.
I envy the officer who ignored Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
same for bob, in this case
I do not agree, thanks to her, we are having a good laugh...!
Nadine; if she didn't exist, we would have to make her up!
It is so easy, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blond wig.
Hats off to you on that one, N.
Morano obviously has no regard at all for the police officer stood in front of her, who, without doubt, would have had to grovel to her and be like "yes, Madam; of course, Madam; straight away Madam; tell me Madam, which way do I have to run in order to catch this covered up woman immediately".
"In one case, Australian Super Hornets pulled out of an air strike on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too high....".
Americans are not bad at it, but still I think Isis will surpass them or already did, in Iraq someone was at least counting bodies now no one do.
When it comes to civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing comes close to the west's war machine.
I disagree, UN ( includes non westerners) imposed sanctions between both Iraq wars is said to have squeezed the life out of millions of Iraqi's, children and elderly and vulnerable adults especially .
Most of the anti- war protestors I knew argued for continuation of sanctions rather than unleashing the 'war machine' .
Were you a sanctions preferable to ordinance and boots on the ground kind of guy too?
A very good point - the UN has taken some incredibly callous and ill-considered actions over the years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and do little to hurt the elites - no doubt a reason why they occasionally get the nod from the so-called Security Council.
You might remember the insurgents wasted no time marking their main enemy as they saw it, in the recent Iraq war.
That was the attack on the UN Mission HQ they had set up only 5 days earlier in Baghdad 2003.
They hit that place hard and twice over and I would imagine with some cold satisfaction.
As brutal and as callous as that bombing was, I was taken by surprise at how shocked people were that a UN mission was targeted the way it was.
Good point, I did forget that.
So, add another half a million to the death toll from the western nations (at least with the recent trouble in the Ukraine the economic activity was aimed directly at the people they were intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures for sanctions-related deaths are for children under 5, and these are very suspect because Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors in.
It was obviously in his interest to inflate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimates extra deaths for this age group are between 200,000 and 400,000, but nobody really knows.
As for extra deaths in other age groups, any estimates are no better than guesses.
Since pre-sanctions deaths of under-fives were about 10 times worse than the UK, for examploe, it is likely that post-sanctions deaths would be heavily biased towards this age group.
Clearly this is something to be worried about, but also gamete donation in general.
We have to stop pretending that people are pure spirits, and that love is the only thing that children need, and that we can have them with people we do not know; someone who neither the parent nor the child is likely ever to know, and with no consequences to them.
One of our founding myths is the Oedipus, 60% of French people make a family tree.
Knowing one's origins is essential and misunderstood.
Rather than pretending that it is clear, and using far-fetched arguments, you have to explain to us what severe problems can occur to a child who is adopted or conceived by the donation of gametes.
If you find out that the parents who raised you did not have the gametes from which you came, you can get over it, in my opinion, because they have not committed any crime.
Recent developments in ART (uterus transplants, for example) are at least as questionable as reasonably controlled surrogacy.
In my opinion, the real question seems to be: does the frustration of wanting to have a child justify these actions? And that has nothing at all to do with marriage.
Straight to the point.
It is clear that we need to be worried about surrogacy. What sort of stupid question is that?
Of course, it is sad if you cannot have children when you want them.
That is a problem that my spouse and I have had to face.
But, nevertheless, it is not as bad as being born disabled, or becoming so; catching a serious illness, or losing all of your children in an accident etc.
Of all the worries we have in life, this is not one of the worst.
It is frustrating just like many other things.
It doesn't stop you from living.
And we can always take care of other people's children!
In a society that no longer accepts any form of disappointment, where a child becomes a consumer good, surrogacy is unacceptable in my opinion.
Wanting a child is not just a passing fancy for which we could use another person who is willing.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
