New Questions Over California Water Project
Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels.
Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California.
The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit.
On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well.
On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.
However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification.
"It's a shell game," said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director.
I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.
The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply.
Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there.
Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile.
The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval.
On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, "the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources."
After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, "This is to be expected" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district.
He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman.
Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project.
Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them.
"Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels.
It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.
Business Groups Appeal to China Over Cybersecurity Law
A coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products.
Signers include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.
The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Tianjin chemical blast: Deadly disaster marked one year on
Zhang Mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the Tianjin blasts
China's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.
John Sudworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching.
But not in China.
While a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of Tianjin, elsewhere the tributes are being muted.
The Communist Party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors, as well as family members of the dead, are being warned not to speak to the foreign press.
But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan won't stay quiet.
"On this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Mr Zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade, stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions.
"The call came in at 10:53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates," he says.
It would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene.
Other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot.
All of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored, way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management.
The fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.
It then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
The resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene.
Those reports never came in.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud I fell into a state of desperation," he tells me.
I knew what it would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night, eight never came back.
Many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event, with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away.
The total cost of the damage was put at more than $1bn, including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed.
A total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters.
Eight bodies have never been found.
An official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption, political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden.
The storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place.
More than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain.
The disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life.
The bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero, there is the other uncomfortable picture.
That of the firefighter as victim, sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable, man-made catastrophe.
Zhang Mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.
He will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades.
What I want to tell them most is this: I've been to visit your parents and they are fine.
Leave your parents to me.
I am a member of your family now.
I will fulfil your filial duty.
Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season
Scotland's grouse shooting season will begin later, with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year.
Several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions.
Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the Edinburgh festivals.
But animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the "brutal slaughter" of the birds.
The organisation's director Harry Huyton said: "The effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices."
It is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel, unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in Scotland.
But landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy.
The SGA's chairman, Alex Hogg, said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a "rich seam of employment" in uncertain times.
He said: "Compared to many other European countries, Scotland does not have an embedded 'hunting' culture and chunks of the population don't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country, economically."
Mr Hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe, Tattoo and Hogmanay combined.
He added: "There are real concerns for employment in rural Scotland at the moment, particularly in oil and gas, so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow.
We want to work with the Scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.
RSPB Scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors
Many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the SGA said the industry had made "significant strides in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the "Glorious Twelfth."
However, the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years.
The wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed.
Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."
Ms Cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags, to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity.
The Scottish Moorland Group accused the RSPB of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the Monadhliath area.
Rio Olympics 2016: Bryony Page wins trampoline silver for Great Britain
GB's Page wins silver in the trampolining
Bryony Page became the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal by claiming silver in Rio.
Page, 25, was beaten to gold by 0.425 points as Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan won a second successive Olympic title with a score of 56.465.
World champion Li Dan of China took bronze, while Britain's other finalist, Katherine Driscoll, came sixth.
I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.
I'm just so happy," said a clearly emotional Page.
I had no idea it was a medal but my performance was the best I could have done, that is why I was so happy, that all the training and hard work had paid off.
I am so happy I got to share the final with Kat, one person would have been history and we got two.
Prior to winning Olympic silver, Page's highest career finish in an international event was fifth at the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.
Trampoline made its Olympic debut in 2000 and this is the first time British women have reached the final.
Reaction to the medal.
Team GB's Nathan Bailey, the only male entrant in the men's trampoline on Saturday, was ecstatic.
Two-time Olympian gymnast Hannah Whelan was quick to heap praise on Page's achievement.
Page secured a first class honours degree in Biology at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate winning rugby sevens gold medal
A 12-year-old boy runs past sugar cane fields on a half-mile journey to the nearest television set in order to watch the game
Extraordinary scenes of celebration have erupted after Fiji won its first-ever Olympic medal.
Banks closed, shops shut and revellers took over the streets of Suva dancing, singing and cheering.
Fiji claimed the gold medal after defeating Great Britain 43-7 in the rugby sevens final at Deodoro Stadium.
Thousands of people across the island nation had stopped what they were doing to watch the history-making match.
Fiji celebrates as the country wins its first ever Olympic medal
Many supporters dressed in Fiji colours and rugby jerseys, carrying the national flag to cheer on the team.
At the final whistle blew, excited revellers took to the streets cheering and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the busy streets of Suva and got out with Fiji flags to join the celebrations, not paying much heed to the slight traffic jam they cause," the Fiji Times reported.
The celebrations will definitely continue into the weekend and the week ahead.
League of Ireland Premier Division: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McEneff netted two first-half penalties for the visitors at Finn Park
Derry City have moved up to second in the Premier Division thanks to a thumping 5-0 derby win over Finn Harps.
Aaron McEneff put the Candystripes in control with two first-half penalties, both given for fouls on Lukas Schubert.
Nathan Boyle fired home early in the second half and Schubert hammered in the fourth before Keith Ward's late lob completed the Finn Park rout.
Derry go a point ahead of Cork City and the teams meet at the Brandywell on Monday night in a crunch encounter.
It was Derry's first win over their north-west rivals in three meetings this season and they were rarely troubled by a disappointing Harps side.
McEneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after Ciaran Coll's challenge on Schubert, although the foul appeared to be outside the box.
There was no doubt the second spot-kick, with former Candystripes midfielder Barry Molloy bringing downing Schubert and McEneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break.
Boyle produced a clinical finish from a Dean Jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart.
City keeper Gerard Doherty had a quiet night but he made a fine save to deny David Scully in the host's best opening of the game.
Schubert flicked the ball past Coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by Ward's clever chip over Harps stopper Richard Brush.
It was Derry's biggest win of the campaign and perfect preparation for the showdown with Cork.
Probe after mass failure of Inverness College UHI course
An entire class of 20 students may have failed a Higher Media course run by Inverness College UHI.
Most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university.
Inverness College UHI said quality assurance processes were in place, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) was investigating.
A spokesman for the SQA said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had "performed as intended."
Twenty students signed up for the Inverness College UHI-run and marked course.
Many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online, but also had to make frequent visits to the college in Inverness from where they lived in places such as Lochaber.
A father of one of the students said that, following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work.
He told BBC News Scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at Inverness College UHI last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.
The situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school.
But her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now "in limbo" and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
Diane Rawlinson, principal and chief executive at Inverness College UHI, said: "We take exam results and student success very seriously."
This is evidenced by the excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both Further and Higher education.
As we do every year, we are undertaking a review of all published results, comparing them against those projected for each student.
In the case of this particular course, the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported 'significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award' and confirmed that 'assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set'.
SQA are currently investigating this matter at our request.
A spokesman for the SQA said: "We are happy that the 2016 Higher Media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject.
Many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the A-C attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers jailed for samurai sword 'bloodbath' in Kilmarnock
Jason Bryden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife and nunchucks
Two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drugs-related robbery in East Ayrshire turned into a "bloodbath."
The victim, Jason Bryden, 38, was repeatedly stabbed during the attack at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.
At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.
His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out "a merciless, relentless and savage attack."
He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Dunlop added: "You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.
Jason Bryden may have been a drug dealer but he was a son, a father and a friend.
He was butchered by you.
After both men were jailed, Det Insp David Moran, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark caused the death of Jason Bryden."
To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.
The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.
The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.
The sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man.
Neighbours said they could see the Clarks attacking Mr Bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming.
Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the trial: "This was a sustained, frenzied attack on this man."
Afterwards, the scene of the killing was described as a "bloodbath."
In addition to the stab wounds, Mr Bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault.
He died in Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital three days later.
Both brothers denied the killing.
In evidence, James Clark, who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder, said: "I didn't mean it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who has 23 previous convictions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by Mr Bryden.
Man jailed for shaking and killing his baby son
David Sinclair admitted killing the child at his home in East Kilbride in 2012
A man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of rage because he would not feed has been jailed for seven years and three months.
David Sinclair shook four-month-old Joshua in a "momentary loss of control" at their home in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical experts.
Sinclair, 34, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bracadale told Sinclair: "You assaulted your baby son by shaking him, causing the injuries which killed him."
You must have known at the time you had shaken him, but you did not disclose that.
It was only after extensive medical investigations you admitted what you had done.
Your wife believed in you.
She now feels she had been misled by you and can no longer support you.
Lord Bracadale described the effects of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for all concerned and added: "Nothing can bring Joshua back."
The court previously heard that that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his wife Kirsty had gone swimming with Joshua and then shopping in East Kilbride.
At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded "shocked."
He told her: "Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away."
He then hung up and dialled 999.
The infant was rushed to Hairmyres Hospital where he died.
Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally, close to the time of death.
One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: "This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life."
Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair was "extremely remorseful" for his actions.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tutton appears to question Yulia Efimova
GB's Tutton misses 200m breaststroke bronze
Great Britain's Chloe Tutton appeared to criticise controversial swimmer Yulia Efimova's presence in Rio after the Russian finished ahead of her in the 200m breaststroke.
Efimova, who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban, took silver with Tutton fourth.
"I would've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games," the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer said afterwards.
I couldn't help who was here.
I'm not happy with it, but that's how it is.
Efimova in second place didn't even know she was in the games until three days ago.
I don't want to see people taken out of the sport, but I don't think that's quite right.
She shouldn't have been in the race and a 20-year-old from Britain should have had a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at Rio 2016 to beat Efimova into silver.
China's Jinglin Shi won bronze, just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed Tutton.
Her British team-mate Molly Renshaw, 20, finished sixth.
"Being fourth is a bit gutting, no matter who is in front of you," Tutton added.
It's a great experience and I'm a bit disappointed to come fourth.
I'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream.
But just to get into the final is a great experience that I'll take on with me for years to come.
It was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time I'll get closer.
Tutton finished just 0.01 seconds outside the British record in the women's 200m breaststroke final
'Everyone should have a second chance' - Efimova
Efimova, who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to compete at Rio.
She was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled that athletes cannot be banned from Rio on the basis that they have been previously sanctioned.
CAS considered my appeal and I won.
If someone dislikes it and has a different opinion, they can go to CAS," she explained.
I am not for doping and I have never used it.
The second case was completely not my fault.
Everyone should have a second chance.
When you drive and you are just issued a ticket, no-one puts you in jail.
Ben Proud powers to 50m freestyle final
Earlier, Ben Proud set a British record to reach the men's 50m freestyle final.
Commonwealth champion Proud, 21, swam a time of 21.54 seconds to qualify fifth fastest for Friday's final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is pushy and rude
India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a conspicuous presence at Rio's Olympic Games, frequently spotted in the stands cheering on Indian athletes and taking selfies after their events.
But he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of Olympic officials with unruly behavior, repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked, the Press Trust of India reported.
Vijay Goel, pictured in July, has defended his behaviour.
On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if the behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held.
"We have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals," Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee wrote in the note.
When the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff.
"Should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior, the accreditation of your Minister for Sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the Olympic Games withdrawn," the letter continued.
The leader of the Indian delegation called the matter "a non-issue being made an issue" and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, chalking it up to a "misunderstanding."
He tweeted, "To my knowledge, we have been following all rules & regulations.
We are committed to the spirit of Olympics & back our Indian players.
Otherwise it's been a gloomy Olympics for India, with zero medals so far.
Bummed-out fans on social media noted that Michael Phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as India has won in its history.
Several prominent contenders have already been eliminated, including shooter Abhinav Bindra who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
He placed fourth this time.
What a waste of money and opportunity," author and columnist Shobhaa De said in a sardonic tweet.
But some bright hopes remain, with competitors foraging ahead in boxing, golf, tennis, track and field and, yes, badminton.
The lone Indian woman gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the vault finals on Sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution "Vault of Death," the Produnova, attempted by few other gymnasts.
For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low medal count has always been a source of consternation.
Analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this.
The national obsession is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for Olympians - Karmakar's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter.
Parents have historically emphasized academics over sport.
And the sports' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges.
In Sochi, India's three winter Olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country, carry the flag or wear the insignia.
They competed as independents.
Injuries force turbulence-rocked Boston-Sacramento JetBlue flight to land in South Dakota
A JetBlue plane was forced to make an unexpected landing Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429, from Boston to Sacramento, landed in Rapid City, South Dakota shortly before 7:30 p.m. local time.
The airline says the injured were transported to a hospital for evaluation.
JetBlue says it sent personnel to assist the injured, and a replacement aircraft was flown to Rapid City to take the rest of the passengers on to Sacramento.
DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana
The answer sadly is: unlikely.
And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.
Up until today, there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana, at the University of Mississippi.
In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.
While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.
Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door.
In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.
Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.
That is the predicament of medical marijuana.
Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.
Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research.
Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive.
There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place.
Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press.
This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.
Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.
Then, after years of bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock.
Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself.
Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.
The problem, however, is that last word in its name: "abuse."
According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine.
Abrams makes an important point.
Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.
Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years.
That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits.
The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."
That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture.
The road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.
While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.
The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.
In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.
For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.
Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.
By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.
Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself.
And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.
With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts.
The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.
That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump 'a blonde Berlusconi'
The Bloody Beetroots is known for electronic dance music
The musicians say Trump's dominance of the media is similar to Berlusconi's
"You know, we used to have Berlusconi in Italy and to me, Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi," Rifo, who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN.
The Republican presidential nominee and the Italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities, their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media.
As the Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bech in the 2013 song, "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian town of Bessano del Grappa outside Venice in 1977, which is around the time punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" are tattooed across the musician's chest.
"English is not my main language so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said from behind a black mask, which he is known for.
I try to explore and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo urged Americans to watch "Videocracy," a documentary which explores Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media.
The documentary is about "how Berlusconi used to drive Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump has had a similar effect on America.
"You see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants," he said.
Trump, to me, looks like something that is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million drugs bust
Two Turkish men convicted of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years.
Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of the Class A drug were discovered inside the MV Hamal about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.
The 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in Europe.
Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal
The massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the Tanzanian-registered tugboat, which was sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter HMC Valiant.
Sahin, 47, was sentenced to 22 years while Ozmen, 51, was handed down a 20-year term at the High Court in Glasgow.
Judge Lord Kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was 'not only significant but massive' and drugs trafficking had a 'devastating impact' on people and communities.
He said: 'You were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship, in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries.'
He told the ship's captain Sahin, he was 'not at the top of the drugs tree' but had played an important role in the offence, while second captain Ozmen's role was 'to some extent a lesser one'.
Officers boarded the Hamal following a tip-off from French customs body DNRED, and once it was docked in Aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, with an estimated street value of £512 million.
MV Hamal was boarded by the Royal Navy last year.
Three tonnes of cocaine was onboard
Tonnes of the Class-A drug were crammed in the ship's ballast tank when it was raided
The ship went from the Bosporus to South America before being stopped in the North Sea
The entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew's quarters, with the opening cemented over.
Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between April 21 and April 23.
The men, both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school, continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury's verdict.
Charges against four other men were found not proven.
Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said the married father-of-two was a 'glorified mule'.
He said: 'Someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs.'
Someone who was able to captain a boat.
In regard to the drugs hierarchy, Mr Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down.
The sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane
Police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes
Sahin was approached about captaining the Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr Crowe said he is 'devastated' about missing out on milestones for his daughter, nine, and son, 13, and 'just wants to go home to Turkey'.
Both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in April 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval.
Ozmen's lawyer, Di Moore, said he is 'desperate' to see his family but knows that will 'remain impossible' for the foreseeable future.
Speaking following today's sentencing, Scotland's Crown Agent prosecutor David Harvie said: 'The international drugs trade does not respect borders, and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead.
'Scotland's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals.'
Drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat, including under the floors
This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by officers
Mr Harvie added:'The Hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from French authorities, and swift co-operation from the Attorney General in Tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded.
'Our investigation then stretched from Guyana, who provided access to crucial shipping records, to Spain, who gave us crucial information on the ship's stop-offs in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together.
Despite strong intelligence that the Hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs, it could not be boarded in international waters by the UK authorities without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted.
Sue Patten, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: 'Acting quickly and precisely, the CPS criminal justice adviser in Tanzania was able get permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence.
Under international maritime law, the UK cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so.
Without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser, there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeijn captures the decaying 'Orient Express' train
Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn snapped these photos of an abandoned train in Belgium
Images show the train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and compact engineer's room
It has gained a reputation as an Orient Express carriage, but it belonged to Belgium's national operator
An urban explorer has captured these remarkable photos of the decaying remains of a passenger train that was once one of the finest ways to travel.
With their glory days long gone, the train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, snapped these eerie images, which show the abandoned train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and floors and compact engineer's room.
The train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, attracting urban explorers
Those trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under that legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The locomotive was used by Belgium's national rail company around 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the rails, the last train service operating under the Orient Express name was from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, bringing an end to a celebrated history.
The Orient Express famously operated between Paris and Istanbul.
When it started in 1883 - run by La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits - it was known as the Express d'Orient.
It became the Orient Express in 1891 and by the 1930s operated scheduled services throughout Europe.
It's not to be confused with the privately run Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Very few Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits luxury carriages still exist.
This snap shows the compact engineer's room, where equipment is rusting, gauges are still installed and wires are exposed
Romeijn said the engineer's room was 'kind of claustrophobic and the noise of the engine must have been tremendous'
The abandoned locomotive and carriage have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeijn told MailOnline Travel: 'I really could feel how it must have been used in its heyday.

Make-up artist Katelyn Galloway transforms into Arrested Development's Buster Bluth
Her impressive make-up skills, reviews and transformations have earned the Texan YouTuber Katelyn Galloway an army of fans.
But her latest transformation, into Buster Bluth from Arrested Development, is pretty incredible by anyone's standards.
In a three minute video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Ms Galloway slowly and steadily transforms herself into the hapless, hook-handed character.
She even uses some audio from the show at the end of the clip, in an eerie albeit brilliant tribute.
The talented make-up artist begins her video as her regular blonde, female self.
Then, via clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly morphs into the balding, bespectacled 'motherboy' that is Tony Hale's Buster Bluth.
Ms Galloway does this by the likes of coloured contact lenses, shading and contouring around the nose and eyes, as well as painting Buster's face onto her head.
Clever ways: Via clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly morphs into Tony Hale's Buster Bluth
She also takes on the personality and mannerisms of the cult TV character over the course of the video, tucking in her chin appropriately.
The clip, shared on YouTube, has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and commenters have been quick to laud the make-up artist's skills:
'You are extremely talented,' one person wrote underneath Ms Galloway's post.
She also takes on the personality and mannerisms of the cult TV character over the course of the video, too
'I love how you stay in character while you're doing these,' someone else added.
Vlogger Katelyn Galloway had previous viral success with her transformation into Parks and Recreation character, Ron Swanson.
She has told her YouTube followers that she hopes to create weekly make-up transformations in the near future.

Lancashire father banned from children's school after wearing T-shirt with swear word
A father-of-two has been banned from his children's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive T-shirt.
Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley, in Lancashire, says he 'accidentally' wore the top with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it'.
But despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the T-shirt inside out, the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds.
The single father, who had been a governor for four years at Park Primary School, in Colne, Burnley, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police.
Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive T-shirt to his children's sports day
Mr Burnley has accused head teacher Sarah Midgely of overreacting.
He said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the T-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete.
The dad, who has now quit as a school governor, said: "It was a mistake, and an oversight on my part.
I was not thinking about sports day and rushing when I put it on.
Towards the end of the event we were having a father's race and the head teacher noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter.
But the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already apologised.
"The headteacher then phoned me and said I was barred from the school premises," added Mr Burnley,
I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested.
Any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction.
Mr McBeth, who is the editor of an online magazine called Love Mini, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term, because of the ban.
But this prompted a phone call from the school and social services.
The t-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles's character Lister from the cult BBC comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic lines -'Let's go out and t**t it.'
He commented: "I told them I was not there because they had banned me from the school.
I then got a phone call from social services asking why I had not picked my daughter up.
The school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.
Mr McBeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice.
He says he was also warned he could face a fine of £500 if found trespassing.
Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said this matter is now closed
Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr McBeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school.
This matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in September.
Burnley councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard," he said.
Councillor Jonathan Nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion.
Mr Nixon added: "He was stupid to wear the T-shirt and he apologised at the time."
Lancashire Police confirmed they were called by the school, but did not attend.
The former VEF factory buildings near Liberty Avenue have recently been renovated - since several IT companies are based there, the area has already begun to be known as a local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF territory, including Berzaunes, is also under development.
The LU Academic Centre in Tornakalns is in the 2nd stage of project development, and construction will cost 21 million euros.
The Latvian University announced their purchase of the academic centre in Tornakalns, Riga, in the 2nd stage of technical design, construction and architectural supervision, according to the notice on the Procurement Monitoring Bureau website.
Procurers negotiated procedures without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be signed with the partnership of the LNK Industries Group, which is committed to contributing 21,186,560 euros to these works.
As the LU explains, the University started receiving European Union funds in 2014.-In 2021 the planning period, for project planning and implementation, will continue to the next round of the Academic complex - the design, supervision and construction of the Science centre building, according to the conceptual design and specifications for construction.
The basic functions of the Science centre building are similar to the 1st stage of design, and the Natural Sciences centre building and its functions, within the most important technical and technological parameters, are similar to the existing building, academic staff and students.
The tender conditions were attached to SIA's Sestais stils sketch design, and information about the Latvian University Academic Centre Tornakalns vision of development was given to all potential suppliers in the tender, including the Latvian University Academic Centre's planned object list, indicating each specific object name, the estimated object area, the planned facility commissioning year and other information.
At the end of 2015, SIA Sestais stils previously developed the Latvian University Academic Centre in Tornakalns building complex spatial meta corrections, during which were specified Academic centre location of buildings and their inter-connectedness, as well as organisation of transport in the meta area and its surroundings.
A tender has been announced for mowing grass on road verges.
VAS Latvian road maintainer announced a tender for the mechanised mowing grass road verges in Latvian regions and near Riga, informs LAU.
Procurement is subdivided into 9 lots: Aluksne, Daugavpils, Jekabpils, Jelgava, Rezekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga districts road maintenance.

Ombudsman: Doubletalk over mandatory health insurance model with an additional financial burden on citizens brings no good at all.
Any doubletalk over mandatory health insurance, which would impose a direct and considerable payment burden on citizens, brings no good at all, considers the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Jansons, today met with the minister of health Anda Čakša to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Jansons told reporters that the health minister's proposed funding model is sustainable and would develop the health care system to make it more patient-accessible.
He noted that in this case it is necessary to talk about additional funding for health care, which is currently insufficient.
Jansons also highlighted that any doubletalk over mandatory health insurance, which would impose a direct and sizeable payment burden on citizens, brings no good at all, especially if it quotes the Dutch model.
Jansons said that the Netherlands devotes 11% of the gross domestic product to their health care system, while Latvia - only 3%.
So the Government and the Parliament should be responsible enough to understand that one should move on from the freezing point, said the Ombudsman and added that, otherwise, the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.
Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and noted that the main concern is that patients need to be able to see a doctor, which in turn means that the health care system needs additional funding.
While the minister pointed out that with the planned additional 35 million euros next year it will be possible to carry out only the most urgent things concerning oncology patients and obstetricians salaries.
Thus, VM has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional 41 million euro allocation to health care, to reduce queues to specialists and to examinations.
"It's a matter of priorities, whether we have the funds or not," said Čakša.
This amount does not include the increase in doctor's salaries.
Commenting on the fact that doctors are not enthusiastic about VM bringing to the government all three options of the health care financing model, including the one requiring additional payment from patients, Čakša said that by pushing through all three models, the government has the possibility to choose.
Jansons also added that by pushing through all three models, it is possible to clearly show that Latvia is not ready for the additional burden on citizens.
As reported, VM will defend the health care financing model which does not increase the overall tax burden, however, calls for diverting part of the social tax to health, according to the summary of the conceptional report "Change of the Latvian health care system financing model."
At the same time the ministry stated that the best health care financing model will be selected as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Locally grown watermelons are now ready to be picked.
Watermelons yielded well this year, acknowledges Grobina county Medze parish Arāju owner Roland Dambis.
Watermelons can now be bought at Liepajas market.
A number of early varieties have started being produced, but later tubers also grew well, according to the regional newspaper Kursas Laiks.
"This year watermelons are growing better than last year," says Artis Kusis, a grower of the large berries in Rucava district.
Also, in terms of the weather this summer was much more favourable than the previous one, which was cold and windy.
Liepaja theatre starts their guest performances in Riga.
On August 12th and 13th, Liepaja Theatre will visit Riga City Theatre, offering viewers both the "Spēlmaņu nakts" (Latvian theatre awards) nominated performances, and fresh intrigue - Liepaja theatre director Herbert Lauksteina's solo performance, as representatives of the theatre have informed the portal "Delfi".
On the evening of August 12th, the audience will be shown the drama "The Elephant Man" staged by director Laura Groza-Kibere.
It's the story of a real historical person - John Merrick - an inhabitant of Victorian London who due to his congenital disease deformed crippled body, was nicknamed the Elephant Man.
The title role is played by the actor Egons Dombrovskis, who for his performance in the the role of Merrick received the "Spēlmaņu nakts" nomination for "Actor of the year".
As the critic Normunds Akots described the performance, Merrick is a ""heart-skipping" role, the kind of performance that can not be repeated".
On August 13th, viewers will be presented a staging of "Portraits".
The performance received six "Spēlmaņu nakts" nominations, including "The largest performance of the year".
Directors created a kind of portrait gallery performance, with equal weight given to all roles, so that each of them is both at the centre and forms the backdrop.
It is as if the play consists of many mini performances, which at the end merge into a whole.
It is the observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between real emotion and cold-blooded calculation, brilliantly revealing how people change in various situations - each of the characters is sometimes a wolf who is greedy for their own gain, attacking the people around them, sometimes a sheep that is eaten by someone else.
In the Small hall on both of these dates will be played Liepaja theater director Herbert Laukstein's solo performance "The man who shuns the lift" with Galina Polishchuk directing.
This is not necessarily a sad but a humorous story about how one mans only friend turns into a lift.
Despite the cemetery theme, which dominates the show's visual imagery, the dominant mood of the performance is, however, bright and even optimistic.
"The man who shuns the lift" is not about loneliness and the fatality of old age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Even if it seems, as if it's not about anything" wrote the critic Liga Ulberte about the show.
Tickets for all performances can be purchased at "Biļešu paradīzes" offices and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: my life is not a TV series, it's real life.
Olga Zelika is already waiting for me- the owner and investigator of the "Riga Detective Agency".
She laughs loudly and gives the impression of being a very positive person.
Dressed in white trousers and a white jacket - a very elegant woman who overturns all my preconceptions about what a woman-detective should be.
She is waiting for me with champagne, which I kindly refuse.
I told her, that I had come to talk to her, because I found it interesting to see a woman doing such an unusual job.
It has always seemed to me like a man's work.
Olga has a higher legal education - a Master's degree
At one time she worked in the criminal police.
She realised that she wanted something of her own, and founded her own company.
She had acquired enough knowledge to do so.
"I really did not want to go back to the police", says Olga.
They have a routine.
There, in the Criminal Police, we researched cases, gathering information.
We were working with suspects.
"This year we are celebrating the ten year anniversary of "Riga Detective Agency''.
She invites me to the anniversary celebrations: "There won't be any drinking."
There will only be decent people there.
Asked about her business, Olga says: "This kind of business is very specific."
The first five years I had team.
Then I came to understand, that it's sometimes dangerous to work in a team.
This is a business, where if there is anybody who isn't working in a professional manner, you can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, then we are the second.
The situation is not completely straightforward.
Many people have tried to shut us down, because they were cheating on their spouses.
As if people thought they could do that!
Many people come and ask, if we can attach listening devices, which will attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
The detective business is a serious one.
"It's information collection", says Olga.
If according to the law a crime has taken place, I must notify the police.
We drink our green tea and laugh - it's good to have a drink, and chat about things.
I had a client, whose husbands constantly beat her.
Of course, she was looking for protection.
We also have security.
Her husband was a maniac.
At the beginning, everything was all well and good, but then it began.
"That was the worst one", Olga says.
The psyche is broken, and you are treated like an animal.
It can all end badly.
God forbid, with suicides.
It is very serious.
At some point, people turn into victims.
"Many women try to get away from their family but then go back", she says.
I refused the last order.
"That was the first time in my life", reveals Olga.
There was some kind of strange situation.
The woman was married, she had a son.
"Her husband beat her son and turned him into an invalid," Olga recalled.
I believe that a woman has a maternal instinct, and must protect their children before anything else.
When it all happened, she came to me asking to help her get free from that man.
There are people who are obsessed with revenge.
The worst thing is that the mother turned a blind eye to it.
I can not understand this.
Her child is now disabled.
Once we could not find a corpse, and the dog was very helpful.
When it comes to drugs, we would not get anywhere without the dogs.
"To my understanding, there are normal people, and then there are those, who are not mentally well", she says.
Of course, there are always cases of cheating.
Or a family breaks up, and we must collect information.
It needs to be established, which is the guilty party.
The latest theme I've come across is that of girlfriends cheating on other girlfriends.
It's interesting, because it used to be men that got jealous, now it's women.
Even the best of friends have fights!
Some women steal 100 or more thousand euros from their friends.
Women have to be careful when going abroad, because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent but much too trusting", Olga believes.
There have been instances when couples have gone abroad, in order to get married a second time.
That isn't lawful.
Olga says that she was once with a man who looked like Jesus Christ.
Tall, with long hair.
When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head injury.
He came back from the hospital as if he was a completely different person.
"I had to leave him", Olga remembers.
It was like being in hell, it was terrible.
When asked what is the most unusual thing she has encountered, Olga says: "Every case is different, but the worst cases, are those where trust is abused."
When a woman steals from her friend.
Borrows money, and does not give it back.
If you have a legal education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"It's one thing to feel like a detective, but actually being one is a different experience", says Olga.
Situations where distrust arises, can get out of hand, because women are often not ready for a settlement.
They are not prepared to accept the result.
They have not foreseen this situation, because they are not ready to lose their family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls, who have a taste for money, use rich married men.
One man, who had his wife followed, said it could not be that she does not have another lover, as his previous wives had also cheated on him.
"He had been married three times", recalls Olga.
It must be the mans problem, if all his wives cheat on him.
Olga tells the story, of a case when a woman left a man taking with her all the children, and she asked him if he had ever lifted up his hand against them.
I usually hit them all the time, he replied.
In such cases, I decline to take on the case.
I find it interesting how cases are solved - are photos taken and shown to the spouse, if there is evidence of cheating?
Could you please describe what usually takes place?
"In parallel to detective work there is the matter of personal data protection", says Olga.
That is a provocative matter.
One law allows you to do anything, the other- nothing.
For personal interests, we are allowed to take these kinds of photos and videos, but they are not allowed for public viewing.
If the court receives such materials that do not comply with the law, then major problems may arise.
To become a detective, education and experience is not enough, you must also be mentally healthy and meet certain criteria.
We do not take fingerprints, the police deal with that.
I tell my clients - forget about TV serials, this is real life!
In fact, when I worked with the police, I had to use dogs, and they really helped.
"When it comes to drugs, we would not get anywhere without the dogs", Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in regards to murder investigations, but I do not like to take on such cases.
They are very serious cases.
Now there are more and more male clients, because women tend to make fun of men.
It used to be different.
Now women go out and have fun, while the men sit at home with the kids.
"Of course, respectable people suffer the most", according to Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He tells us - stop worrying, and start living.
We all know the saying, if somebody slaps you on one cheek, turn to give them the other, but this isn't what you should do!
This has to be said, even though it's unpleasant to hear.
You shouldn't be acting like this.
You shouldn't fear to lose something, that's stopping you from living your life!
You shouldn't become a masochist, and yet we do this to ourselves.
Yes, my first case was directly linked to a cheating husband, when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that her husband was lying to her.
She was constantly ringing and asking, what he was up to now.
"I now ask all clients, if they are prepared to accept the situation where they find out that their husband really is cheating", Olga says.
This isn't entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you need to take responsibility.
It's not a play, or a TV show, it's real life.
I am also a specialist in Reiki.
It's a passion of mine and a part of Japanese medicine - using your hands to heal others.
It's a very interesting field.
Why did I choose to start practicing Reiki?
It started with the large amount of adrenaline I had to deal with, I needed a way of calming myself down.
Reiki not only soothes, but restores energy, lightens your spirits.
"People leave my office positive and happy", says Olga.
Her office wall is covered with Reiki symbols, and Olga says that they are not created with a brush, but with your fingers.
I did not really start to study Reiki, until a book about it literally fell into my hands.
I saw that as a sign.
However, this is very personal.
Find out more about Reiki here.
Olga also sings.
This is her hobby.
We all want to be creative.
I've played guitar since I was 11.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I am positive and smile, but it's necessary to rest, to recover.
Others find refuge in alcohol, but it's Reiki that saves me.
Alcohol helps you to lose yourself.
The police use it a lot, because work is so stressful.
"It can cause aggression, and unpredictable actions", she says.
I'm interested in sports and Reiki.
Aged 15, I used to play tennis.
Then I loved riding horses.
I disconnected in nature, wrote things, thought I'd like to write a book.
In detective work there's a fine line between work and your life.
"It's the kind of work, that you don't need to let into your life", she says.
When asked how to reconcile work and private life, Olga says, "The person I love the most in the world lives in Italy."
We have very strong feelings about each other.
It's probably the realest love of my life.
It's enough for me to think of him, and I already feel better.
Detectives aren't usually trusting, but he has accepted my work.
As it happens, I separate work from my private life.
However, I don't feel trapped in this business.
Reiki has given me direction in my life.
When I was a child, I saw more than others did.
Thanks to Reiki, I have opened up my intuition.
There are many detectives, but few of them really make a living out of it.
In any case it's a job where you work with your mind, and it can be hard to relax.
You also need to be able to rest.
"Otherwise you cannot renew yourself", Olga recognises.
The worst case, which I ever took on, was the story of Constance.
I worked a year on that case.
The husband made a complete mockery of his wife.
I made sure that the child and mother left for England - far away from danger.
There was no other choice.
We must not pity ourselves.
We need to find a balance.
We shouldn't do that.
We must be thankful for every day that we have.
We must thank God.
Every day we must say three good things to somebody else.
We must do a good days work or devote the day to ourselves.
We shouldn't baby our men.
That's a big mistake.
We need to understand that next to us is a man, not a child, and we need him to care for us.
If it's not a good situation, you need to leave.
You can go to church, that's something that has helped me a lot.
There's no need to be fanatical, but do what you enjoy and what helps you.
Nothing is going to change, if you don't change it yourself, you have to go away and change your own life.
Under no circumstances should you put yourself and your children in danger.
Don't sit and wait for something to happen.
People were created to do good deeds, and help one other.
If God created us, then we have a purpose and have not been born into this world for no reason.
Don't sit around as if you have nothing to do!
How best to prepare for a family photo session.
Summer is still in full swing, yet creeping up on us is the new school year, which families tend to want to immortalise with photographs.
So that everybody looks happy and beautiful in the pictures, it's worth thinking in advance about how to prepare for the photo session.
"Ihappymama" tips are provided by large family mum Alexander Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You must try taking pictures in nature, because it's so much more natural and harmonious.
It's much more difficult to get children to relax and have fun in a photographers studio.
It's a good idea for the whole family to choose a single style of clothing, preferably in the same range of colours.
For example, Aleksandra says that she chooses the outfits of all six members of the family so that the clothes have no more than three colours and have as little writing as possible on them.
Don't forget about having a good time.
Have fun, joke around, play together, but in no case should you shout or get angry at the children if they forget to follow instructions.
The following advice comes to you straight from a professional photographer!
You need to know exactly what you want to immortalise during the photo session, and be able to tell the photographer about it.
For some, it will be beautiful, neat children and a perfect-looking family picture, for others - "life is the way it is", namely the desire for pictures to represent real, genuine emotions, or as the photographer describes it - "fleeing backs", " averted eyes", or a "snub nose".
Of course, sometimes people want the "two in one", but that doesn't happen often.
In any case, when attending a photo session, it must be understood that it's only a couple of hours of your life, and the less tension there is the better.
Be yourself - not the strict mother who works, cooks, looks after children and so on, or the modern busy dad, who is constantly talking on the phone.
And don't be hiding away in your shell.
Be a family, remember how great is to hug each other, smile at each other and share a joke.
And then the photographer's task will be to capture those moments of real emotion.
If you have chosen a photographer, then trust him.
Refrain from asking 250 times to see the picture, listen to her advice in regards to clothing, and where to take the best shots.
Choose and iron all the clothes you need in advance of the photo session, so that you don't have to deal with that on the day.
Plan your route and think about how much time you will need to get to the location of the photo session (especially if the session is going to take place in the studio, and time is limited).
If you have small children, then choose an appropriate time of day for the photo session, so that you're not having pictures taken when the baby would usually be having a nap.
And of course, do not forget to bring the kids food, biscuits, water and their favourite toys (only use toys and sweets in extreme situations).
Let Dad know, if for example he might have to take off his socks, but advice articles don't usually write about these kind of things, and only photographers know where the real problems lie, says Marina.
Don't drink a lot of water before the photo session, and try to sleep well the night before.
And perhaps you could organise some kind of fun activity to do after the photo session.
Go to an amusement park, eat some ice cream, have a go at roller-skating - do whatever your family enjoys the most.
You'll have both great pictures and fond memories of the day you spent together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: raising the minimum wage - a wave of a magic wand or a brake to the economy?
The issue of raising the minimum wage in public debates has an almost sacred cow status: either support the increase, or mention some unimpressive, general phrases.
In view of the economic stagnation with a significant increase in risk (just barely avoiding a technical recession), we believe it is important to emphasise that raising the minimum wage would not be a magical wave of a wand to reduce income inequality, approaching the level of Western European wages and fulfilling the state budget.
On the contrary - if the minimum wage raises too much, it causes more harm than good because its being raised reduces the competitiveness of enterprises and employment, particularly in sectors and regions with low income.
At first glance, it appears that, despite the number of minimum wage increases in the post-crisis period, the Latvian minimum wage is not so high that raising of the usual few tens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses - it is only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries, the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture emerges if we compare the average salary in the country (%) - with the Latvian minimum wage (44%) which is higher than the EU average.
Since the number of Latvian minimum wage recipients is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6% [1]), by volume a similar minimum wage increase would affect more companies.
According to the Latvian Bank's business survey, one in five Latvian companies said that the increase in the minimum wage in early 2014 was an important or very important factor in increasing the prices of products.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage increase was partly financed by consumers (that is, Latvian residents); secondly, the price rises to more than one company meant a loss of competitiveness both domestically and abroad (that was promoted by an increase in imports and limiting exports).
Weaker competitiveness and declining production volumes for almost every fifteenth Latvian company was important in the laying off of employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleventh company responded that raising the minimum wage was an important factor in them having to limit hiring new recruitment.
It's worth remembering, that in 2011 -2013, the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if after the raise of the minimum wage in 2014, every fifth company noted a large improvement in productivity, it does not mean that a similar result could also be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase in a row could in fact deplete productivity options).
Another important result is - the minimum wage rises due to a number of companies were also important in increasing compensation for employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the minimum wage had a significant effect even in those companies where none of the employees received minimum wage.
In recent years, the minimum wage increase in all three Baltic countries exceeded the nominal labour productivity (real productivity + inflation) growth.
Henceforth, with labour productivity growth an unfounded minimum wage increase (even though it be at a low level in euro terms) will adversely affect the competitiveness of companies and employment.
When assessing the merits of lifting the minimum wage, it is not sufficient to use solely an economic analysis.
It should also be considered, whether raising the minimum wage will be "tolerated" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is the most commonly used.
The Latvian Bank survey shows that the highest concentration of employees earning minimum wage is in small enterprises (number of employees from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013 the industrial and service sectors had more workers earning minimum wage (16% and 19%) than the sales (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two-thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its future growth can be rather detrimental, reducing the demand for labour (ie, maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the shadow economy.
There are signs that in 2014 - 2015 the sizeable increases implemented in the minimum wage (up by 27%) was a disincentive to growth in Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only Latvian region where the unemployment rate in 2015 was higher than in 2013.
It should be noted that in Estonia and Lithuania, there is no region which has so significantly lagged behind the average wage when compared to other countries.
For example, in all regions of Estonia the average salary in the country is at least twice the minimum wage.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Taurage region, but even there the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average wage (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).
Public discussions from time to time have called to lift the minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lack economic justifications, and it is not feasible in either the short or the long term.
First, such a high percentage of the average wage, or even one so close to it, is not seen in any other EU country.
Secondly, it would lift the minimum wage above the average wage in a number of sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcies and mass redundancies), in sectors such as clothing, leather goods production, fish processing, food services, as well as veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average salary in the private sector of Latgale.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to 400-410 euros per month, as the Ministry of Welfare is currently offering, would make the Latvian minimum wage (by % of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If the nominal productivity increases by 4%, while the minimum wage is at least twice the rate, it will clearly have a negative effect on the competitiveness of companies and employment.
Such negative effects will be most prevalent in sectors and regions where the current minimum salary is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that a substantial increase in minimum wages cannot currently be afforded, means that other mechanisms are needed to support low-wage recipients.
Immediate effect can be achieved by raising the personal income tax-free allowance (as much as the budget allows).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality attainment of education, as well as poor health (which often occurs without going to the doctor for medical services in view of the high cost and a long waiting list) are the real causes of income inequality.
The survey obtained responses from 521 Latvian companies in regards to the January 2014 minimum wage increases.
The survey was issued by the European System of Central Banks Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent companies with a workforce of no less than 10.
This also explains the low proportion of workers with minimum wages in construction.
Yesterday 11 fires were registered in Latvia, according to information from the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
The largest fires were reported in Ogre county Ogresgala parish, where a fire of 80 square meters destroyed an unlived in single-storey house, and Dzelzceļmalas Street in Jekabpils where a fire burned down a sawdust-filled shed of 30 square meters.
On Thursday firefighters also responded to calls about fires burning waste, tires, two cars, buildings, walls and ceilings, sheds, a roof of a residential building and unattended burnt food.
In 24 hours, the service also participated in 21 rescue operations.
The number of deceased, injured or rescued people were not reported.
Overall, yesterday the VUGD responded to 38 calls, of which six were misleading.

Russian Vice-president secretly meets in Riga with ZZS ministers.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Deputy Arkady Dvorkovics last week visited "The Seagull" fish processing factory, with the participation of the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Transport Minister Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Janis Duklavs, reports internet portal "skaties.lv".
As reported by the portal, none of the parties informed or notified others, but Reizniece-Ozola confirmed the existence of the meeting, and shifted the responsibility for negotiating such a secret meeting to Duklavs.
In turn, the Minister explained that the organiser was the Russian Ambassador Alexander Veshnyakov.
The Finance Minister explained that during the meeting they discussed the lifting of sanctions for fish processors, as well Russia continuing to "pump" from the Incukalns gas storage.
Dvorkovics explained that it was not a government matter, but one involving energy companies.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not involved in the discussion.
Duklavs based this the ground that he had not seen the need for it, since "the Foreign Minister is taking leave", writes the portal.

Huffington, the legendary editor, leaves "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Huffington, the influential US media holding "The Huffington Post" co-founder and editor in chief, announced her departure from the company after 11 years.
"The Huffington Post", established in 2005 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, presents daily coverage of both serious political and economic journalism, as well as internet sensation entertainment news, and is considered a pioneer in the development of media at a time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, set up in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions at a time when Twitter did not exist, but Facebook was gaining popularity among students in public colleges.
Not long after the Republican Party Representative George W. Bush's re-election as US President, Huffington did not hide that their media journalists represented liberal values, and used this viewpoint when creating news content.
Now Huffington has revealed on Twitter that after leaving she is going to start a new business - she plans to create the "Thrive Global" startup, which will deal with workers' health and overwork issues.
It's not yet known, who will replace the "The Huffington Post" editor in chief.
While she was in control of the portal, she refused to allow anonymous comments, with Huffington stressing that freedom of expression is for people who can stand behind what they say, and who do not hide behind anonymity.
In the summer of 2015 the editor decided to publish news about the US presidential candidate Donald Trump in the entertainment section.
Indeed, at the end of 2015, indicating that Trump rhetoric is dangerous for the US public, details about the odious candidate were again published in the political section.
It reported that in 2011, US Internet media group AOL decided to acquire the rapidly expanding news website "The Huffington Post", which at the time of the transaction was visited by nearly 25 million readers a month.
The transaction amounted to 315 million dollars.
In turn in 2015, the telecommunications giant "Verizon" bought AOL for 4.4 billion US dollars.
Also, "Verizon" in 2016 bought shares in the internet business "Yahoo".
As a consequence of these transactions "The Huffington Post", once a powerful and independent media, became a small part of a giant corporation.
At present, the famous brand of media content is available in nine international editions, with their total monthly unique visits measuring 81 million.
Explosions in Thailand kill four people.
The Thai resort town of Hua Hin and the southern provinces have seen nine blasts in the last 24 hours, which killed at least four people and injured dozens, reported the authorities on Friday.
In Thailand's southern region Suratthani province on Friday around eight o'clock local time, two explosions occurred.
One bomb exploded from a pot in front of the building of the marine police, killing the municipal employee and injuring a male citizen, announced Suratthani Province governer Wongsiri Promchana.
"I think it has to do with the bombings in Hua Hin," said the governor.
The second explosion occurred in front of the provincial police station.
On Friday morning in the south of Thailand two explosions hit the popular tourist island of Phuket.
On Friday morning in Hua Hin two bombs exploded at the bell tower, killing one and wounding three people.
As reported, on Thursday evening shortly before midnight in the resort town of Hua Hin two explosions blew up, killing one woman and injuring 19 people, including foreigners.
The murdered woman killed in Hua Hin on Thursday was a national of Thailand.
Three of the 19 injured were in a serious condition, and seven of the wounded were foreigners - four women and three men.

Police rescue a baby from overheating in a car; parents threaten legal action over the broken glass.
Riga municipal police yesterday saved a baby from a hot car, while the child's parents threatened policemen with legal action for knocking out the car window, LETA was informed by Riga Municipal Police (RMP).
Yesterday an agitated man ran towards the patrol, who reported that at the Spice shopping center parking lot he had noticed a car in which an infant had been inside for half an hour without any sign of the parents.
Arriving at the scene, the eyewitness pointed out the car, which was parked in the sun.
In the front passenger seat was a child seat, with the infant.
The sun was shining directly onto the child.
The baby was crying loudly and breathing intensely, their face was red and sweating.
Considering that the owners of the vehicle were not there, it was immediately decided to knock out the cars rear glass, so as not to compromise the baby's health and life.
The baby was removed in their seat from the hot vehicle, and doctors were summoned.
The child's breathing was shallow, their skin was red and hot, so until the arrival of the medical team, the police put a cool compress on the baby's forehead.
The medical team and the child's parents arrived at the scene almost simultaneously.
The infant's father, seeing his vehicle with a knocked out window, became aggressive and refused to let medics near the baby.
Discussions were started with the parents, and it was explained to them that it is illegal to leave a child under the age of seven on their own.
In addition, the child was left in conditions hazardous to their health and life.
After the interview the doctors examined the victim and found that hospitalisation was not required.
However, the parents categorically refused to give any explanations about what had happened and threatened with legal action for the knocked out car window.
During the negotiations, there were no indications that the parents were drunk or could otherwise be harmful to the baby, so the nearly four months old infant was returned to their care.
A file was sent to the Children's crime prevention department, whose officers will assess parental responsibility.
RPP notes that even if it is not very hot outside, the sun can heat up the inside of a car very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left inside of the car, it can be life-threatening.
LPF members may be required to suspend Pone.
Members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) will in the near future be able to request the suspension of the current federation president Kaspars Pone, LETA learned from the Federation's former vice president Janis Dzenis.
Dzenis says that, taking into account recent days criticism of Pone and his activities in the federation, a number of LPF members have signed a letter asking to convene an LPF general meeting, which is the highest institution of the federation, having the power to decide on any issues raised by the LPF general meeting.
Federation members are not satisfied with Pone's management style, while his presence at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, to which record-winning Latvian Olympic swimmer Alone Rybakov's coach Germanam Jakubovski was not allowed to go, is considered to be an unethical and unworthy presidential action.
Woodpecker noted, that LPF members, as well as the Secretary-General of the federation, Aivars Platonov, have carried out great work in the development of the federation and sport, but Pone's contribution to the federation is not considered to be useful.
Dzenis, who for a long time worked in the federation, explained that in the federation there had been a noticeable attempt to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Consequently, federation members may be required to amend the LPF regulatory statutes, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Dzenis explained that there had long been dissatisfaction with Pone's work at the federation, but recent events had served as "the last straw" for federation members, resulting in them making the decision that action needed to be taken.
The former vice president of the federation stated, that Pone's activity reduced the ability of coaches and the judges' council to carry out their work.
Dzenis explained that in order to ensure a faster decision-making process in the federation, the LPF members in a general meeting, made decisions on the amount of power that should be allowed to the management board, composed of Pone and two vice-presidents, in their leadership of the federation.
However, as Dzenis acknowledged, Pone deceived the federation members.
Federation members trusted Pone, believing that in this way the federation would be able to make decisions faster.
"He betrayed the trust of the members, since practically speaking he took power into his own hands by taking an unethical step", stated Dzenis.
"A person who should be acting as an example for other sports representatives, should not have such an attitude", stated Dzenis.
Dzenis believes that Pone tried to satisfy his own ambitions by being president, which is not an honourable attitude for the President of the LPF to have.
Longtime LPF general secretary Vladimir Maslovskis told LETA that the federation's letter would be presented next week to the LPF general meeting will be held in a month's time.
In his opinion, the general meeting must "discuss all the outstanding issues," and decide on further action.
On Friday Pone had not yet been informed that members of the LPF were planning to convene a general meeting, which may decide on his dismissal from office.
I know nothing about the organisation of this meeting, so I have no comment to make.
With regard to the fact that members are not satisfied with my work, up to now only one example has been mentioned, in regards to the aforementioned coach Jakubovskis, who has expressed his dissatisfaction.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribakova had not yet approved participants, he approached the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) with a complaint, calling for Latvia not to send any athletes.
"In this case Jakubovskis lost the role of team senior coach, because his actions did not correspond to the interests of the LPF", said Pone.
He also stressed that so far he has not received any criticism from the LPF general meeting of members, who evaluate progress.
"On the contrary, I have received news that the quality of work of the federation has improved", said the LPF president.
Pone also explained that he has not gone to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics to have fun, but to work.
Most Latvian people do not understand what being the President of the Federation entails, and what his duties are.
People do not understand that we are in these positions voluntarily, and, for example, in contrast to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOC) leaders, we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we must ensure that sports federations have sufficient funding, since the LPF receives only 10% of the required amount from the government.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with the International Federation and representatives of various international programs, including with international sponsors.
"We have also entered into negotiations and are working on one of the stages of the 2018 World Cup taking place in Riga", said Pone.
As shown by data from the portal "Firmas.lv", in 2015 LPF income totaled 249,444 euros, an increase of just under 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
Approximately 40% of this amount last year went towards earmarked subsidies, the amount of which, compared to 2014, increased by around 10,000 euros.
As for members, joining and other annual fees to the LPF accounted for around 43% of revenue, or 109,442 euros.
Donations and gifts to the federation last year accounted for a further 35,532 euros.
Last year, the federation expenses compared to 2014 increased by around 70,000 euros, and in 2015 as a whole 263,876 euros were spent.
The largest expenditure was not related to cash payments to persons or material costs, nor salaries - in the report, 215,733 euros is identified as "other expenses".
20,549 euros is listed as cash payments to entities, while wages accounted for 14,684 euros.
If the federation concluded 2014 with a positive balance, then the LPF ended 2015 with a negative balance.
As reported, the Ministry of Education (IZM) requested clarification of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for the LPF President Pone's participation in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, to which Latvian swimmer Rybakov's coach, Jakubovskis, had not gone.
None of Thailand's Latvian nationals were affected by the recent explosion, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (ĀM) update on the social site Twitter.
The ministry indicated that in accordance with the information currently available to the Latvian Honorary Consul in Thailand, no Latvian nationals were involved in the explosion.
LETA already reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls for travelers to keep track of information about political and security developments in any country they visit, as well as to ensure the safety of the place they stay in, indicating that in Thailand there is a high threat of terrorism.
The Latvian Foreign Ministry advises to avoid places where people gather, to be particularly careful and observant when you are in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
The ministry advises travelers who are currently in Thailand's resorts or planning to go there, to communicate with tour operators or airlines, in order to confirm whether the travel procedure will be implemented as planned.
The Ministry also invites travelers to regularly keep track of information about political and security developments in the country, as well as to ensure the safety of the place they are staying at.
The country still has a high rate of terrorism.
In view of the fragile security situation in the country, the Foreign Ministry recommends not to visit the Thai-Cambodian border, as well as provinces on the Thailand and Malaysia border - Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Songkhla.
In an emergency, the Ministry advises to make immediate contact with a member of the Consular Department who can be contacted twenty-four hours a day by phone on +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail at palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also strongly recommends buying life and health insurance policies before travelling abroad, which will insure you in the case of illness or death while living abroad, as well as registering at the Consular Registry.
Messi, however, will not leave the Argentina national football team.
Football superstar Lionel Messi after a brief moment of reflection, however, decided to return to the national team of Argentina, announced the player himself on Friday.
In July, the Argentina team failed for the second year in a row in the Copa America tournament finals, with the crucial match re-emphasising the superiority of Chile.
Immediately after the loss Messi announced that he would retire for the national side, but then it was reported that he would return to the team.
"I was seriously considering withdrawing from the team, but my love for Argentina and the team is too great", said 29-year-old Messi.
Spain's Granda Barcelona striker Messi playing for the national side scored 55 goals in a total of 112 games, which is the all-time best performance.
Along with the adult team Messi has not been a great success, although in 2014 Argentina became the world vice-champion.
We called him the world's best footballer five times.
Chinese men Zhen and Zelin win a double best in the Rio 20 km walking distance.
Chinese walkers Zhen Wang and Zelin Cai won a double best on Friday in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in the 20 kilometers walking competition.
Zhen was crowned as the Olympic champion, and completed the distance in one hour 19 minutes and four seconds, finishing 12 seconds ahead of Zelin.
The bronze was won by Australian walker Dane Bird-Smith, who lost to Zelin by 23 seconds.
The home team's favorite Caio Bonfim broke the Brazilian record, but he missed climbing onto the podium by 5 seconds.
Four years ago Zhen won a bronze award in London.
In the same race he won two silver medals at world championships.
Judo coach Baskin: Nikiforenko is not a true heavyweight.
Latvian judo coach Oleg Baskin honestly admitted, that Arthur Ņikiforenko had almost no chance of beating the heavier by far Ushangi Kokauri, Azerbaijan athlete at the Rio Olympics.
Practically there was only a minimal chance, if he was able to catch him out with some techniques or grappling.
We had already anticipated the result.
His training was correct, he fought well, but his opponent was stronger.
He knew his opponent well, since Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice, and both times Arturs lost.
He was however heavier.
Arthur had been artificially moved to the heaviest weight category in order to get into the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already taken, so Arturs entered the heavy weight category.
Arturs with a 100 kilogram weight fought against a judoist who was 140 kilograms, and who had already won serious tournaments a couple of times.
In general in the heavy weight category there are very few moments were luck comes into play.
In the lightweight categories the fight can take all kinds of directions, but in the heavy - it's very rare.
When asked whether Nikiforenko would be better to fight in a one step down lighter weight category, Baskin answered in the affirmative.
I think yes - it would be better to put Arthur in a fighting category of up to 100 kg.
That's his real weight category.
He's not really a heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to oust Maduro, the question is if they are willing to fight for it
Two out of three Venezuelans want to revoke President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seems to be whether or not they are willing to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there is "no time" for the recall vote to take place this year - securing Chavismo's grip of power until 2019 - people in Caracas went about their day as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals," said Rafael Deyan, a 36-year-old office clerk taking a break in Altamira Square on Wednesday.
Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against Maduro's regime.
Yet now, when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energy.
"I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons," said Deyan.
Others, more informed, are willing to mobilize in the future but admit Venezuelans are less motivated.
Electoral board president Tibisay Lucena's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reyes, 60, told Fox News Latino.
So on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: motivating people to go out to the streets and protest.
Until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase.
But when it comes to protesting against the government's maneuvers to block the effort, turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low.
"Some people are focused in making food lines, while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014," said Cipriano Heredia, a lawmaker for the opposition.
After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government claim President Maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage Venezuelans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor.
If he were ousted this year, however, he is mandated to call for a general election.
The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a statement Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people.
"The remaining steps for the realization of the Presidential Recall Referendum need to be pursued clearly, concretely and without delay, and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country," it read.
Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, said change is not likely anytime soon.
"I think that there will not be a referendum this year, unless the social unrest and protests grow much more," he told FNL.
He said that in his view Lucena and the government are breaking the law, but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people don't protest loud enough.
The opposition has called for a big rally on Sept. 1st in Caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day.
The government will feel the pressure," Heredia said.
But Salamanca thinks that the situation can't wait that long.
"They should have a quicker and stronger response to Lucena's announcement because it practically kills the referendum," the expert told FNL.
Congressman Heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner, but other groups prefer to have more time to organize.
The opposition has to be careful now.
If people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition," said Salamanca.
The referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country's electorate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activated.
Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017, Chavismo will be hurt.
But some are not that optimistic.
Our party wants political change this year.
"If the government closes down the electoral path, we will have to explore other legal options," Heredia told FNL.
LNSC director A.Pukitis is temporarily suspended
On August 12th, Lielvarde county council held an emergency meeting in which a majority supported Lielvardes County Sports Centre (LNSC) Director Ainars Pukitis suspension from work duties, while an inspection of the service is carried out.
In the near future they intend to clarify the circumstances, which the municipality wrote involved a gym attendant.
Namely, during a visit to the gym, an LNSC customer received a head injury.
Lielvardes County Sports Centre was alleged to be at fault.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and the client's possible further legal actions, a Commission was established by Vitas Volonta, Vice-President of Lielvarde Regional Council.
Its mission is to carry out service inspections of the sports centre, and present a report by August 16th this year.
Next Tuesday is planned a re-convening of an extraordinary session of the City Council, to decide on further action.
It should be noted that at the time of the relevant accident, A. Pukitis had been on vacation.
The Sports Centre Acting Director, from Friday for the duration of the trial period is Deputy director Oksana Grimaluka-Nazarova.
Ogre is celebrating sports for seniors.
Today Ogre Sports Centre Stadium held a Sports Festival organised by Ogre pensioner society.
Seniors met up at Ogre Sports Centre Stadium for Development of Sport Work organiser Sanita Taurina, who had prepared a special programme for the sports festival participants.
This time individual results will not be evaluated, but the sports festival participants will be divided into four teams.
"Each participant will add their effort to their team and see the result", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will undergo four tasks - basketball quick shots, Eiffel Tower construction together with a memory game, floorball agility skills, and summer skiing.
In order to be successful in all four festival programme activities, participants had to carry out warm-up tasks - "Unity circle", "The purse Dance", "Parachute", as well as three relays - Riding a horse, catching a frisbee and badminton.
All tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and Sports Festival participants carried them out with joy, smiles and funny comments in support of one another.
Special excitement was caused by the summer skiing, which was held by organisers wearing costumes.
Races were closely followed by Ogre Sports Centre volunteers, who led the tasks, recorded the results and did not ban the giving of helpful advice.
Ogres pinecone symbol was present throughout the event, which helped to inspire Sports Festival participants.
Ogre seniors showed that they were quite athletic, attractive and in good shape.
Green team member Peter Zeps took one minute exactly to throw a ball into the basketball ring eight times, only one effective shot behind his team-mate John Staudzs.
Ogre pensioners are active.
Organised bus tours are always full, dances are attended by about 300 people.
"Twice a week we meet at the Family Support Centre in rooms where we can play novuss, table tennis, and use the training machines," says Ogre Pensioners' Association chairman John Staudzs.
At the end of the Sports festival all participants received Ogre Sports Centre's thanks for their participation, but the greatest benefit they gained was exercise in the fresh air, a good mood and spent time together.
Premier League 2016-17 previews No19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian writers" predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction but the average of our writers" tips)
Last season's position 14th
Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 1,000-1
Until last week it looked like a case of new season, same old West Bromwich Albion: 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic Tony Pulis.
But then Jeremy Peace sold his 88% stake in the club to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, the archetypal safe pair of hands, was immediately made the bookmakers" favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired.
The landscape has undeniably altered in the Black Country - and not just at The Hawthorns, but a few miles north-west in Wolverhampton, too, where new Chinese owners wasted no time in relieving Kenny Jackett of his services.
Pulis, however, has been given reassurances by Lai that his job is not in immediate threat, and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture.
"I have no wish to change the club's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree," he said upon taking over.
I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term.
First and foremost, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier League and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division.
I believe it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.
Such is Pulis's record, the first aspect should not be too problematic.
The next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides.
To progress from last season's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front.
Only Aston Villa, tailed off at the bottom, scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes, by some stretch the division's worst.
They failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions.
Of their 10 victories, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0.
Predictably, a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces.
Little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at The Hawthorns, perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with Villa in late January, when the visitors looked the more likely.
On the flip side, only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves.
Those defenders are often underappreciated, not least Jonny Evans, who is said to have Arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis.
The Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Championship and it would take a hefty fee for Albion to sell.
Ben Foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield.
Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32, and Claudio Yacob is underrated.
Irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of Saido Berahino's future remains unresolved.
Bids from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected under Peace's ownership but the former remain keen and Mark Hughes is happy to be patient.
After last season was close to a write-off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through.
The striker is undoubtedly talented but with, as Pulis mentioned more than once, people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable.
Albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former England Under-21 international go but their £15m move for Diafra Sakho broke down days before the takeover, with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season.
It places a lot of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomón Rondón, who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals, especially if Rickie Lambert continues to be as ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anichebe and Stéphane Sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect.
Pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts - in the final game of last season, a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, is unlikely to become the norm.
He will return to the tried and tested but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.
The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season, becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the Premier League, and is also highly rated in the England underage system.
Matt Phillips, a £5.5m signing from Queens Park Rangers, will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign.
It is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one.
"All over," Pulis told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be strengthened.
Every position that you look at.
The back players, midfield players and front players, we have to strengthen.
The targets have been there, we know what we want.
Getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged, mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process.
The season could be defined by how they start, with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
By that point the pressure on Pulis will have eased or become insurmountable.
And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK rescue deal closer after trustees back pension changes
The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company.
The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of £15bn and a deficit of as much as £700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.
The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.
However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.
Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified.
Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to £300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control.
Johnston said the trustees accepted it "would not be realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit.
Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms.
Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government.
Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable."
Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded.
"We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on," Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India.
There is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.
The pension trustees" willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel.
The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.
Johnston added: "The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.
CBC commentator confuses Michael Phelps with Ryan Lochte for whole race
An Olympics commentator working for Canadian broadcaster CBC suffered embarrassment on Thursday night when he confused Michael Phelps for rival Ryan Lochte.
Elliotte Friedman mixed the pair up for the duration of the 200m individual medley final, which Phelps won to claim his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
As Phelps streaked home for the win, Friedman believed him to be Lochte, Phelps' compatriot and long-term rival at the top of world swimming.
Friedman shouted: "Finally, he's going to do it!"
Ryan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps in this event!
Phelps might not even make the podium.
Phelps, however, won while Lochte trailed in fourth.
In the immediate moments after Phelps touched for gold, CBC's broadcast fell silent.
Friedman, admirably, admitted to his error immediately.
I apologise, I got my lanes mixed up.
Phelps with the gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism has been widely praised after the mistake, owned up to his error once again in the hours after the event and apologised to viewers on Twitter.
I'm sorry everyone.
I blew it.
"No excuses," he wrote.
Phelps, meanwhile, broke a 2,168-year-old record for the most all-time individual Olympic titles with the victory.
The previous record was held by Leonidas of Rhoses, who is believed to have won more Olympic titles at the ancient games than anyone else.
Russian hackers accessed data from the former Commander of NATO forces.
Hackers published General Philip Breedlove's lists and data about one of the Soros foundations works.
The same hackers who some time ago could have been implemented in the US attack on the Democratic Party emails and conversations that they published, could be to blame for the new series of attacks, reports the "Bloomberg" agency.
According to the acquired information, these cyber attackers hacked the former European NATO Force Commander General Philip Breedlove's correspondence and the "Open Society" Institute of workshops that are part of the projects supported by millionaire George Soros.
The attackers posted the information they obtained on the website DCLeaks.com.
There they posted correspondence and data on the "Open Society" Institute's activities.
It is reported that hackers had access to the fund's computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that they are the same hackers who carried out the attack on the US Democratic Party's computers and who are run by Russian special services.
US intelligence already warned Congress top officials about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
The news agency "Reuters" reports that they have information that at that time a number of politicians told special services - cyber attacks coordinated by two Russian intelligence or controlled organisations controlled by them.
But congressmen have not been able to pass on this information to victims of cyber attacks, because it was classed as secret.
The scandal of the attacks on the Democratic Party's computers began after around 20 thousand e-mails were published on the internet, written by representatives of the party in the US presidential election campaign.
Party candidate Hillary Clinton said that the leaking of those letters was organised by the Russian special services.
Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorism.

Parking at the happiest place on Earth should be easier the find in the future.
Disneyland has released details of a long-proposed parking structure, a transportation hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern end of the theme park resort.
The project, located east of the resort near the 5 Freeway, includes a 6,800-space parking structure and a transportation hub where buses, shuttles, taxis and other vehicles can drop off park visitors.
A pedestrian bridge over Harbor Boulevard connects the resort to the parking structure and the transportation hub.
The structure, along with the 14-acre Star Wars Land expansion project under construction, is part of a $1-billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year exemption on an entertainment tax.
Construction of the project, dubbed the Eastern Gateway, will begin next year.
The parking structure will be built on Disney's Pumbaa parking lot, which has about 1,300 spaces.
The transportation hub will replace a commercial property that the theme park purchased in 2014.
The project is expected to open in 2018.
"The Eastern Gateway is part of our substantial investment in Anaheim, which will provide additional guest parking and help to alleviate congestion in the resort district as we continue to expand the Disneyland Resort," Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown said.
On Saturday and Sunday please be aware that the embankment will be closed.
"This has been the situation every year, and people already know that these days we must expect a different flow of traffic," says the deputy head of the municipal Andris Ameriks.
However, the costs for holding the Riga Festival will amount to about 500,000 euros.
"Including the events held at the port, which haven been supported by advertising - including 24hr basketball, the regatta and the big evening event - costs amount to approximately half a million euros", says Ameriks.
Riga this year celebrates its 815 year anniversary, and cinema has been chosen as the festive leitmotif, since it is 120 years since the first screening of a film was held in Riga.
This memorial sign will be opened tonight near Līvu square, and in Vermanes Garden "Saklausi kino" (Listen to cinema) will be held.
The film will be shown at Riga Central Market, Grizinkalns at the "Splendid Palace" cinema.
The main festive events will start at the side of the River Daugava tomorrow, but from the evening of November 11, the waterfront will close to vehicle traffic.
"Valsts nekustamie īpašumi" ("State Real Estate") have broken their contract with RBSSKALS employees, while performing the conversion of a tobacco factory.
This means that the New Riga Theatre removal and reconstruction of historical rooms in Lacplesa Street will experience delays until at least the next summer.

President Vejonis is replaced by Exprimeminister Dombrovskis in the "Krastu mača" politician's match
"Krastu mača" organiser Edgar Jaunups reported on the Latvian State Television broadcast "Morning Panorama" that the basketball court "Krastu mača" will take place over 24 hours.
One game will last an hour, and altogether there will be 48 teams with more than 600 participants.
"Krastu maču" was started by the "VEF Riga" team, who will present their own next season players.
By contrast, "Krastu maču" traditionally has a team of politicians competing in the game.
This year the Latvian ex prime minister and current European Commission's vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis will return to the game, who last year released the game and who has played in five out of a total of six "Krastu maču", said Jaunups.
Dombrovskis will replace the Latvian President, Raimonds Vejonis who was the politicians team captain last year.
Dombrovskis team will face the people of Riga with Riga Deputy Mayor Andris Ameriks at the forefront.
Liepaja home insulation requires consent by two-thirds of inhabitants.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and specifically talk about the technical condition of the building, and such an opportunity exists to receive support and rearrange the buildings, it is quite silly not to use it.
One of the most significant changes is that EU co-financing can be obtained this year by any apartment building, the only condition is that it has to have an insulated façade.
Previously, funding could only be used on a terraced apartment building.
The biggest worry for house managers can arise at the organisation of the apartment owners meeting.
A major problem that is currently delaying the process is that it requires 67% of apartment owners consent.
"The previous programme only needed 51%," says SIA "Liepajas house keeper" (LNA) Project manager Tom Cirulis.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure that number, because such a large amount of apartment owners do not come to the general meetings," says the "APSE House Service" company's Project manager Gints Locmelis.
The largest house maintenance service in Liepaja - "APSE House Service" and the LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plans by the new programming period in 2020 to have renovated at least 50 multi-family homes.
They do not exclude the possibility that at the beginning of the work it will be hard to convince people to vote for the renovation, but with each new project implemented, public attitudes should improve.
I also had to get a bank loan, I needed 76% of the domestic population.
"I had to talk, explain, what will happen - but I managed to get those signatures," says an elderly inhabitant of the most energy-efficient building in Latvia, Vita Iesalniece.
She agrees with Janis, who also lives in a heated building.
Well, it's not what half of them think, and the other half can't agree with them.
"No, of course it is important that everyone agrees with the whole event," says Janis.
Such regulatory changes were proposed by representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that, with 51% of votes, the banks are not able to raise the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the last programming period.
Most commercial banks require two-thirds of apartment owners signatures.
As one of the recommendations of the house managers the Ministry of Economics of the European Union Fund Head Anda Lagzdiņa mentions, there is the possibility of introducing the people with existing examples and the various benefits that would result from renovating buildings, such as energy saving.
In his youth, Aaron had been very angry with the world for his mother's death.
The capture of the potential suicide bomber in Canada was worthy of a thriller.
Everything began when Canadian police received an intercepted video recording from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal Canadian police received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a so-called "martyrdom" video recording, which is a recording of a nameless man who is clearly in the last stages of preparation for an attack.
"And he is preparing by creating home-made explosive devices," said Canadian Police Deputy Chief, Mike Kabana.
On the video recording, a man wearing a black mask speaking in English and Arabic threatens Canadians and promises to take revenge for everything they have done to Muslims.
After about three hours of using facial and voice recognition software, Canadian police were able to identify this man.
It was 24 year old Aaron Driver.
He was already on probation under supervision for glorification of terrorism and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.
At the court's decision he was forbidden from continuing to do so and also from engaging with any radical organisations.
However, authorities did not until then believe that Driver would present any physical danger to others.
When police arrived at his home in the town of Strathroy in Ontario, the young man had come out and entered a taxi.
At that point, police attempted to arrest him, but Driver, sitting on the rear seat, had already triggered the bomb.
So as not to let him detonate the other bomb, the police started shooting at the young man.
He died from the resulting injuries.
The taxi driver was not harmed.
Wayne Driver, the father of the neutralised terrorist, said in an interview for Canadian television that his son had embraced Islam during adolescence.
It had originally helped him with giving up drugs and alcohol.
However Aaron was a problem teen, who for a long time had been very angry with the world for his mother's death, added his father.
Only today, when I saw the video on the news, did I realise how far he took it.
I had no idea that he was so completely radicalised.
"And I also was not aware that he knew how to speak Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.
Canadian police recognised - if they had arrived a few hours later, the story could have been a very different one.
Radevica will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian athletes
Former Olympian and athlete Ineta Radevica tells LTV from the Olympic studio that Heptathlon athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidina's Friday's performance in the first two disciplines were not bad, considering that the athlete had previously experienced an injury.
Also, during the high jump Laura started with her right foot and not with the left like usual.
Radevica pointed out that it's comparable to someone used to writing with their right hand, suddenly being forced to write with their left.
Therefore Ikauniece-Admidinas result, taking into account her injuries, is not at all bad.
Radevic revealed that though she's not yet had a chance to meet with Ikauniece-Admidina, she has been avidly following her athletic attempts and sympathising with her.
Ineta learned about Laura's injuries recently and expressed support for the sportswoman, saying that athletes should not wrap themselves up in cotton wool, but should prove their character and fighting spirit.
In terms of other sports Radevica believes that Olympic standards are very high, so for a Latvian athlete to be criticised for going to Rio only as a tourist, is incorrect.
She remembered that when she went to her first Olympics and gained 13th place, she was called a tourist, and that made her experience negative emotions.
Ineta will sometimes recall her starting matches, not only her Olympic attempts.
"I prefer to remember my emotions, rather than the results," recalling her sports experiences, revealed Radevica.
She says, that it has always been important for there to be people in the stands emphasising with her, sending her support.
This year however Radevica will go to Rio as a tourist, so that with her presence she can support other Latvian athletes.
She says that she will definitely visit the track and field competitions.
In 2010 Ineta Radevica won the European championships.
In the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens she took 13th place in the long jump and 20th place in the triple jump, but the athlete did not compete in the 2008 Olympics due to being pregnant with her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radevica came 4th place in the long jump.
In Murjani the film "Quantum Code" will be shown, with physicist Kashcheyev in the main role.
The film's synopsis says that In parallel to splitting electrons in the laboratory, he is a dreamer, a family man and an educator, socially active and civically minded, who seeks a connection with the All-mighty.
The films own protagonist told Latvian State Television programme "Morning Panorama" that shooting the film had been an interesting experience.
I learned about how the best films are made, how the sound is recorded.
"And in reality it's an amazing job", says the physicist.
He says that it took two years to create the film.
The biggest differences with the director were about the title of the film.
I was categorically opposed to this title.
There is no such thing as a quantum code.
"It's no secret that, after watching the movie, you will learn a bit more and everything will be made clear," added the LU Associate professor.
Kashcheyev admitted that he likes the fact that the movie premiere was shown in Murjani's open-air cinema in the evening.
It's been organised by the friends of the "Viegli" foundation, and the film will be shown every evening until September 9th.
Thailand Bomb Blasts At Tourist Hotspots Kill Four
A series of bomb blasts across five of Thailand's southern provinces targeted popular tourist destinations on Thursday and Friday, leaving four people dead and many more injured, after the country voted to approve a military-backed constitution.
Two explosions first hit the seaside resort of Hua Hin on Thursday night, before another blast struck on Friday morning.
The town is located some 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The first blast killed one Thai woman and injured 20 people, 10 of them foreigners, police said.
Authorities confirmed that other blasts had targeted the southern cities of Phuket, Trang and Surat Thani.
Two bombs exploded in the town of Patong in Phuket and two more in Phang Nga, another tourist region just north of Phuket.
A total of 11 bomb blasts struck the country over the last 24 hours.
The blasts were not linked to Islamic extremism but acts of local sabotage, Royal Thai Police official Col. Krisana Patanacharoen said on Friday.
"It's too soon to jump to any conclusion," he said.
But what we know for sure is that the incidents are not linked directly to any kinds of terrorism, in fact it's local sabotage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scenes.
Investigation officials collect evidence from the crime scene after a small bomb exploded in Hua Hin on August 12, 2016.
A string of bomb attacks targeting Thailand's crucial tourism industry have killed four people, officials said on August 12, sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators.
There are no conflicts in the country that may lead to terrorists being in the country.
"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not accused any particular group, but the explosions occurred in the same week that Thai voters approved a new constitution.
The three southern provinces of Hua Hin, Phuket and Phang Nga all rejected the military-backed referendum, and the Muslim-majority southeastern provinces of Thailand have faced an insurgency that has left more than 6,500 people dead since 2004.
The blasts came on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit, a public holiday in the country.
Hua Hin hosts the Klai Kangwon royal palace, or "Far From Worries Palace," where the country's monarchy have often stayed.
King Bhumibol Adulayadej is the world's longest-serving monarch.

Porgy and Bess - something we've been waiting for, for a long time!
There are an endless amount of operas that have never been heard in Latvia.
There are also those that are heard only rarely.
However, it seems strange, that since the late seventies George Gershwin's opus Porgy and Bess has never been staged, apart from the solo number Summertime having its periodic appearance on stages (including the summer festival of the same name organised by Inese Galante), and at individual student projects, guest performances and the like.
There are reasons for this - since Latvia is a civilized Western country, it is bound to Gershwin's family heirs ruling and copyright licencing in regards to Porgy and Bess is valid until 2030.
The consent procedure is not simple.
In addition, in creating a full staging, the author stated that all fourteen soloists must be black.
In Latvia, of course, not much is known about the discussions and context of race in America, and it would be hard to respect the composer's request.
As a compromise, four artistic black American singers and their Latvian colleagues helped to brightly voice the Cesis Art Festival's 10th anniversary on August 6th, recreating Gershwin's magical sounds, which intertwine the European classical music tradition with American jazz rhythms, gospel, 20th century style dances and memorable hits, including the poignant Catfish Row with Porgy as a completely gnarled beggar, and Bess's pretty butterfly love story, with a musical quality that deserves documenting in musical history.
Firstly, it's due to the National Symphony Orchestra and conductor Andris Poga.
Despite the complex spatial layout of the outdoor areas for concert performances in Cesis Castle Park, with the orchestra in the side stage next to the stage, where there were soloists and singing (and amazing dancing!) in the chorus. The overall sound was stylistically nuanced, rich in contrast and accurate for the strings, brass, and wind instruments, as well as the piano (played by Martins Zilberts).
Second, the great soloists of the team.
The charismatic dramatic baritone Lester Lynch (Porgy) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire includes both baritone and bass-baritone parts, especially Verdi's operas.
He has sung the role of Porgy countless times, on several occasions playing Crown - in this opera he was like a fish in water, and even inspired his colleagues by conjuring up a fishing village full of poor people with an emotional atmosphere of solidarity.
Latonia Moore in her second Porgy and Bess concert (the first was held in 2012, with no less than with the Berlin Philharmonic and Sir Simon Rattle) revealed herself to have a range of flexible and vital vocal styles, able to combine dramatically toned timbre and fantastic piano in the upper register.
She's not one of today's brightest stars without a reason.
The attractive tenor of Jamaican origin Jermaine Smith, who Andris Poga once saw on the Boston stage, has played the role of drug dealer Sportin'life on four continents.
In it he demonstrates his simultaneous dancing and singing skills as well as his training as a musical actor.
Smith is one of those rare gems, whose voice still seems to be hiding yet undiscovered vocal features as it did 15 years ago, when he accidentally found his opera voice, when he was trying to make his friends laugh.
It's incredible, that even from 24 rows away and in relative darkness, Jermaine Smith's expressive gestures let you see in his hands a bag of "magic dust", even when there is nothing there.
How could the poverty-stricken Bess not follow such a Mephistophelian tempter, who can turn empty space into the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of Crown is played by the timbrally generously endowed Rodney Clark.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloists team Cesis staging was Sonoras Vaices version of Siren - a luxurious upper register, skillful balancing between speaking and singing of the text, according to the changing voice line, vocal acrobatics and drama filled performance both Siren's lament My Man is Gone Now and the stylish leadsinger's prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
Margarita Wilson's voice fit the role of Clara well, but she voiced the iconic Summertime lullaby at the outset a little too loudly and nervously, not expressing its true character.
Colourful and glamorous voices were provided by Mikhail Culpajevam, Richard Macanovskis, and Andris Lapins (especially with the castle-ruin walls scene, with the crab-seller and the strawberry woman Irma Pavera's soprano tessitura).
Bright characters were played by Ilona Bagel, Richard Miller, Emila Kivlenieks, as well as the speaking roles, which Ivo Martinsons standing out in the character of the investigator, with the white lawyer Archdale unexpectedly played by Cesis festival director and actor Juris Zagars.
A historical Kairisa concert performance space was created by the three-dimensional concept of the choir soloists working on steps - mainly on the proscenium, coming and going on the stairs.
It was a dynamic and a rather comical situation, as the Latvian musicians held folders of musical notations in their hands.
Although their presence has quite a prosaic explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes made it difficult to keep up with which role they were playing).
Second, Porgy and Bess has a lot of dialogue, phrases inserted into conversation, rejoinders, which are easier to keep track of if you have the notes in front of you.
The sub-titling machine at Cesis really helped listeners to follow along.
The weather wasn't as good as it could have been, and it rained through quite a bit of the first half of the performance.
However, this did not prevent the majority of listeners from staying until the end, to cheer for the artists.
Nine in the evening is a pretty late start time for a full-length opera, especially if you have a long journey home from Cesis, however, we're lucky to have the opera Porgy and Bess back on the Latvian music scene and, most likely, it will be one of this summer's most prominent musical experiences.
The opera has also visited Liepaja, where it played yesterday evening, though in quite different acoustic conditions.
Man scares children with an axe at a Riga playground.
Yesterday, on August 11th, at around eight o'clock in the evening, the police received a call from the grandmother of one of the terrorised children, who was alarmed at the fact that in Lomonosov Street, in the children's playground, a man was threatening children with an axe.
Law enforcers immediately reacted to the call and arrived at the scene, where they found this man with an axe, who at the time of the event was very much under the influence of alcohol - 3.07 per mille.
It was found that the man, born in 1962, had already threatened children, to try to stop them from crying.
But this time, frightening the children, the aggressive man used an axe which he used to attack children's playground equipment.
The man was arrested.
He is now undergoing criminal proceedings, charged with serious public disorder in the form of apparent lack of respect for society or impudence, ignoring generally accepted rules of conduct and disturbing people's peace of mind.
Such a crime is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or a short-term imprisonment or community service, or a fine and probation supervision for up to three years.
Federation presidents of the Olympic Games usually use guest accreditation.
Sports federation presidents usually visit the Olympics venue for a few days and use guest credentials, which can change names, so that during the competition they will have several owners, LETA learned from the Latvian Olympic Team (LOV) spokeswoman Marita Vilcina.
On Wednesday an uproar resulted after the statements of Germana Jakubovska, the coach of the Olympic swimmer Alone Rybakov, which revealed that at the last minute, the Latvian Federation (LPF) head Kaspars Pone decided to go to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, while the coach had to stay at home.
Later it became known, that Pone arrived in Brazil with coach accreditation, which the president himself expressed surprise at, because "now I'm not allowed access to anywhere".
As Vilcina reported, only two federation presidents lived in the London Olympics athletes village - Pone, as well as the head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS) Guntis Zalitis.
Olympic athletes live in the village, as well as officials, including, for example, coaches, doctors, and an administration delegation.
Therefore, it's likely that Pone had had coach accreditation in London, as well..
"The other federation presidents arrive as guests, and they have interchangeable accreditation - they're here a couple of days and then it's used by someone else," said Vilcina, explaining why the federation presidents don't usually live in the Olympic village.
Pone arrived in Rio de Janeiro in late July and will leave Brazil on August 13th, so most likely he will be there for longer than all the other national federation presidents.
Significantly, the Latvian athletes swimming competitions last for one day only - August 10th.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports in the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, and LETA's calculations show that six or seven federation presidents will go to these most important competitions, which are held every four years.
Zalitis will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) president Hugo Japins will be at next week's BMX competition, the Latvian Windsurfing Federation president Ansis Dale plans to fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16th, when Katie Birzule's competitions will have come to an end, and the Latvian Fighting federation president Dzintars Urbanciks - a day earlier.
Also, the president of the Shooting Federation of Latvia Karlis Kreslins is planning to attend next week, when the shooter Dainis Upelnieks competitions will already be over.
The Latvian Judo Federation president Raymond Rublovskis did not arrive at Rio de Janeiro, at least during the Latvian athletes competitions, though it was planned; the Latvian Canoe Federation currently has no president; the weightlifting Latvian society is still experiencing conflicts and its athletic international competitions apply to the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, Latvian Volleyball Federation president Atis Sausnitis and Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to travel to Rio de Janeiro.
Vasilyev judges Latvian women to have the most natural breasts.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasilyev has been visiting Latvia frequently in the last year.
Most recently, he judged the "Miss and Mister Latvia 2016" finals contestants and found that the Latvian beauties, in contrast to the Russian representatives of the fair sex, could boast more natural breasts and lips that are not improved with silicone and botulinum injections.
In a conversation with the "Evening News" Alexander Vasilyev talked about being for many years the jury president of the popular "Miss Russia" beauty contest.
That is why he eagerly engaged in the judging of the "Miss and Mister Latvia 2016" participants.
Asked the difference between Latvian beauty pageant standards and similar competitions in Russia, Vasilyev stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: "the Russian beauties have a fuller bust, unlike the Latvians."
However, the Latvian girls are beautifully dressed and coiffured, and boast a natural beauty rather than plastic surgery accomplished miracles.
We therefore particularly welcome the Latvian beauty pageant participants with their natural beauty.
In connection with his professional activities in Latvia, Vasilyev has big plans.
Currently, the fashion historian has a collection exhibition "Domesticated nature" on show in the Decorative Arts and Design Museum.
Also, in Ventspils Livonian Order Castle, can be seen the Vasilyev exhibition "Wedding gowns 1860-2010".
Vasilyev loves Ventspils so much, that he spent a couple of days enjoying the hospitality of the city and going for walks along the sea.
I really like Latvia.
Especially now that across Europe there is the threat of terrorism, this is a real corner of paradise.
"Spending time and relaxing in Latvia is a pleasure", says the fashion guru.
In addition, on 23 November, Alexander Vasilyev will reveal a private fashion museum in the Old Town.
Please help!
Please donate towards the treatment of our son, brother, and grandson.
As Rinalds' family, we are grateful for the amazing people who surround us and God, that we have the chance to save Rinalds, but, unfortunately, there is currently no opportunity to fully cover the medical costs by our own means.
Rinalds Grinbergs is an 11 year old boy from Tukums, who in late July was diagnosed with brain tumours.
This year he graduated from the fourth class in Milzkalnes primary school with a note of excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.
It seemed that everything he tried at, he succeeded.
A healthy, lively, tenacious, diligent and active boy.
Always smiling and happy.
July 26th will stay in our family's memory for the rest of our lives.
The last couple of weeks he struggled with nausea, headaches, but doctors blamed it on a stomach virus.
At the beginning, it seemed that must be the case.
Because who would have thought that such "innocent" symptoms were really a warning of the unthinkable.
On July 26th we received the diagnosis - Rinalds had a growth on his brain.
Fluid was rapidly accumulating in his brain, but all Latvian doctors would be able to do to help would be to make a bypass operation to divert excess fluid, since a direct surgical operation on the tumour was practically unavailable.
They were also unable to determine whether the tumour was benign or malignant.
The only treatment that the state would pay for: start a course of radiation, and see what happens.
It was like being in a nightmare - they wanted to experiment, and see what the result would be.
Luckily we got a chance to show Rinalds test results to a doctor in Spain.
He is vice president of the World Association of Neurosurgery, and one of the world's leading neurosurgeons.
He offered to carry out the operation, since as it turned out, he needed to be operated on immediately.
The tumour was putting tremendous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications was too large.
They also needed to quickly determine whether the tumour was benign or malignant, in order to plan further treatment.
They didn't need to think about it for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to rescue their son.
And with fantastic speed, on August 8th Rinalds together with his mum Evija arrived in Spain and was operated on August 9th.
It was a very difficult surgery, that lasted for more than 6 hours.
The operation took place at the "Santa Elena" clinic.
They succeeded in removing most of the tumour, relieving pressure on the brain, and obtaining samples for analysis.
Rinalds was soon up from bed and like a typical teenager, asked for fries for dinner.
Now he is just waiting for the results from the oncology analyses.
Thanks to Dr. Araezam and the people in charge of the clinic, who understood the situation and the need for an urgent operation, without full payment for treatment prior to surgery.
They trusted that the remaining amount will be paid, and only requested the first 10,000 euros as a deposit, before going through with the operation and saving Rinald's life.
The parents managed to raise 6,000 euros by selling equipment, and they were able to borrow from relatives and friends the rest of the required amount for travel expenses, accommodation, and the hospitals first installment.
But we still need at least 24,000 euros to pay for the first phase of treatment in Spain and return the money that we have borrowed for the first payment.
Please help us to pay for this operation, that was so important for Rinalds health.
Each euro will help towards covering the cost of the already carried out operation, and to be able to successfully continue Rinald's treatment.
Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What's Vladimir Putin Up To?
It's difficult to judge the truth of these claims.
Ukraine denies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evidence.
An open-source analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, found some indications of a firefight on Saturday, but little to back up Moscow's grander claims.
Russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends, particularly within the fog of Ukraine's still-ongoing conflict.
That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all false.
Ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power Crimea, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations.
An attempted attack in Crimea is not out of the question, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot.
Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday - before the supposed attack occurred.
These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense.
A disturbingly familiar Russian escalation
Some reports indicate that Russia's troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation.
Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim.
Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation.
That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to "protect" ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack.
He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force.
What is Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?
Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention.
Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion.
But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended.
"It's highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive," Mr. Galeotti said.
Rather, "We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension."
International peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant.
By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink.
"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength," Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September.
"And the only real strength is to say, "I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to." "
Positioning for a bargain with the West
Mr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process.
What does this actually get him?
For one, it allows Russia to continue asserting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australia's.
For another, it positions Moscow as having a veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control.
It may also serve Mr. Putin's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria - on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally - as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation's economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports.
Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists.
But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office.
Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable.
But Mr. Obama is seen as "looking for resolutions, not conflicts," Mr. Galeotti said.
So there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia's weaker neighbor guessing about what's coming next.
An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
It was 2014, not 2013.
With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds to Fight Zika
The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month.
That would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time, as locally acquired cases of Zika infection increase in Miami.
As of last week, 7,350 cases of Zika had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Ms. Burwell said that 15 infants had been born with Zika-related birth defects.
The virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
The local spread of the illness in the continental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government's response.
Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made a campaign stop in Wynwood, the Miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted Zika cases, and pressed Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus.
President Obama and congressional Republicans have been at odds for most of the year over Zika.
In February, Mr. Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding.
Republicans balked, demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go.
Lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent.
Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of a Republican measure that would have allocated $1.1 billion to fight Zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for Planned Parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus, which can be sexually transmitted.
The deadlock prompted the White House in April to shift $589 million in Ebola funding to the Zika effort, about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use.
On Thursday, Ms. Burwell said that her department had used most of that money, and that it would be gone by the end of August.
"The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays," Ms. Burwell wrote.
Democrats seized on the announcement to berate Republicans for failing to provide additional money for Zika.
At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, to bring Congress back to advance such a measure.
"Every possible option is being exhausted, and now we're going into the National Institutes of Health, which is supposed to be a priority," Ms. Pelosi said.
Aides to Mr. Ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the Obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the Zika issue.
The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a Zika vaccine on 80 human subjects, and hoped to begin a second phase in "Zika-endemic countries" in early 2017.
But without more funding now, officials said Thursday, the research would halt in its tracks.
Ms. Burwell said she would transfer to the Zika efforts $34 million in N.I.H. funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another $47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies.
That money will come out of a variety of accounts, including $19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction.
Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to "severely curtail many of their critical efforts" against Zika without action from Congress.
In the last four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related syndromes.
Thai Leader Links Attacks on Tourist Sites to Constitution Change
The head of the Thai junta urged his countrymen on Friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.
Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were "bad people" opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum," he said in an address to the nation.
The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and injured dozens.
The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related.
Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, one of the few bright spots in Thailand's economy.
At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Hua Hin.
"Whatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable," said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
These attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in Hua Hin on Friday.
The police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.
They have portrayed the attacks as "local sabotage," not terrorism.
The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism.
The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most injuries occurred.
The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.
The junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote.
The bombings were "clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries," he said.
Last year, a bombing at the popular Erewan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tourists from China.
Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week's bombings "hurt the hearts" of Thai people.
"Why now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?" he said.
We have to ask why, and who did it.
Golden Reaction: What Simone Manuel's Historic Moment Looked Like
Just coming into this race tonight, I kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just being in this position.
But I do hope that it kind of goes away.
I'm super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport.
But at the same time I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it's not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title black swimmer makes it seem like I'm not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I'm not supposed to be able to break records.
That's not true because I work just as hard as anybody else and I love the sport and I want to win just like everybody else.
The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in Bogotá, leaving as his suicide note a Facebook post quoting Pink Floyd's "Goodbye Cruel World."
His death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled Colombia this week, as the effort to expand L.G.B.T. rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation.
After his death, Mr. Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship.
A year later, Colombia's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia's gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage.
This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling.
The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry.
Ms. Parody quickly debunked that.
While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules.
"What we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts," Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday.
The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group.
A coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed, accusing the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity.
To complicate matters, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an accord on gender and L.G.B.T. equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics.
They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister.
Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms.
"Part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet," she said.
This is a tough stage and a very lonely time.
She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students.
As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark an seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said.
"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she said.
While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day.
"To me, it's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential," Ms. Parody said.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing.
Keeping the Vote Cybersafe - The New York Times
In "U.S. Seeking Ways to Keep Hackers Out of Ballot Box" (news article, Aug.
4), Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the Obama administration is discussing giving extra protections to the nation's electoral system.
This change may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
The diverse nature of the cyberthreat, and the recent revelation that outside actors, possibly nation-states, have an increased interest in influencing our elections, make it imperative that the federal government give additional attention to securing our electoral system and possibly deem it part of our nation's critical infrastructure.
Without delay, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer the Department of Homeland Security's assistance, expertise and guidance.
While the diverse and varied nature of our voting infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it, this tells us that the process should begin as soon as possible.
The writer, Democrat of Mississippi, is the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee.
Boy hurt on Pennsylvania roller coaster, week's third amusement park injury
A boy was injured when he fell from a roller coaster on Thursday and he was flown to a Pittsburgh hospital, emergency services and park officials said, in the third accident this week involving children hurt on U.S. amusement park rides.
The child, whose identity were not released, was flown to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Idlewild and SoakZone theme park in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, a spokeswoman for Westmoreland County Emergency Services said.
The 3-year-old boy, who was on the ride with his brother, was conscious while being treated on site, park spokesman Jeff Croushore said in an email
Croushore said the ride, known as Rollo Coaster, would be closed pending an investigation.
Idlewild requires children to be at least 3 feet (91 cm) tall to ride the roller coaster, and those shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.
The ride was built in 1938, according to the park's website, and the state department of agriculture said it passed inspection in August.
A hospital spokesman declined to comment on the boy's condition.
A 10-year-old boy died on Sunday from a neck injury sustained while riding the world's tallest water slide in Kansas City, Kansas.
On Monday, three girls aged 6, 10 and 16 were hospitalized after they fell more than 30 feet (9 meters) from a Ferris wheel when the basket they were in overturned at a county fair in Greeneville, Tennessee, local media reported.
Japanese PM Abe will not visit war-dead shrine on WW2 anniversary: Jiji
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not visit a controversial shrine for war dead in Tokyo on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War Two defeat, Jiji news agency has reported.
However, Abe plans to send a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine to mark the anniversary on Monday, Jiji reported on Thursday.
The shrine honors 14 Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals and is seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime militarism.
Abe has not visited the shrine in person since December 2013, which he said he did to show respect for those who died for their country.
Japan's new defense minister, Tomomi Inada, has declined to say whether she would visit the shrine because it was a matter of conscience.
Inada, a close ally of Abe and a supporter of revamping Japan's pacifist constitution, had made regular visits to Yasukuni in the past.
Masahiro Imamura, the minister for reconstruction of disaster-stricken areas, visited the shrine on Thursday and said he prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity, Kyodo news agency reported.
Ties between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have been strained of late after a growing number of Chinese coastguard and other government ships sailed near disputed islets in the East China Sea, called the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Two suspects held in possible Rio Olympics plot: police
Police arrested two people on Thursday suspected of supporting Islamic State in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Police had arrested 12 people before Thursday's operation, all suspected of collaboration with Islamic State militants.
Brazil's federal police said three others have been interrogated and later released.
The two arrested on Thursday were Brazilians, but police did not provide names or other details.
Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, the government has said the Games made the country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting Islamic State.
Its militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and a U.S.-led coalition has conducted air strikes against them.
The group has supporters worldwide who have carried out shootings and bombings of civilians.
New suspect in French priest killing formally charged
A man under arrest since Monday as part of the investigation into the killing of a French priest last month has been placed under formal investigation, a police source told Reuters on Friday.
The 21-year old suspect is under investigation for collaboration with terrorists and was planning attacks on people, the source said.
The man had been in telephone contact with Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, who interrupted a church service in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, western France, on July 26, and slit the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Father Jacques Hamel.
Both were shot dead by police.
The suspect had traveled from his home town near Toulouse to Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source said.
The young man, who has no criminal record, has acknowledged having spent the night there but told investigators that he had left the next day because he did not had a good relationship with Kermiche and Petitjean, the source said.
Investigators are trying to establish whether Kermiche and Petitjean had accomplices in France and whether they had links with Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.
A cousin of Petitjean was also placed in preventive detention at the end of last month.
Dorus de Vries undergoes medical ahead of Celtic move
Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has arrived in Glasgow as he looks to complete a move to Celtic.
De Vries was pictured entering Ross Hall Hospital ahead of a medical after the Hoops agreed terms with the Sky Bet Championship club.
Parkhead boss Brendan Rodgers is on the look-out for an experienced stopper to challenge current number one Craig Gordon.
But Rodgers has trust in 35-year-old de Vries having worked with the Dutchman during their spell together at Swansea.
He made 51 appearances for the Swans as they won promotion to the Premier League under Rodgers in 2011.
He quit the Welsh outfit that summer to join Wolves and has been at the City Ground since 2013.
He also has experience of playing in Scotland after spending a season with Dunfermline after signing back in 2006.
His East End Park stay ended in disappointment, however, as the Pars suffered the double agony of being relegated from the top-flight before losing out to Celtic in the final of the Scottish Cup.
The keeper has just one year left on his Forest contract and it has been reported Celtic will only have to pay a nominal fee to land his signature.
Macy's to close 100 stores
Department store giant Macy's said on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, it says, has too many stores for the online shopping era.
Macy's regularly prunes its store portfolio, often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush.
But in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations, the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores.
Macy's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change: Many of its stores are located in small, regional malls, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce.
And the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and fast-fashion players such as H&M to buy their clothes.
These factors, along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather, have left Macy's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter, a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenue was $US5.87 billion ($A7.64 billion), down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year.
Macy's said the store closures would probably cost it about $US1 billion in annual sales.
And at one time, such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer's concession of defeat.
Yet the company's stock soared 17 per cent on Thursday, a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for Macy's.
In some ways, it should not come as a surprise that Macy's is slashing stores.
Terry Lundgren, the retailer's chief executive, has said before that the chain simply had too many stores.
Executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores, trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations.
Jeff Gennette, the Macy's executive who has been appointed to replace Lundgren in 2017, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding.
"We recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand," Gennette said.
The company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.
Macy's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed.
The retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores, but will look to close stores that are in weak locations.
The move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators, who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres.
Is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria?
According to new research, drinking from refillable water bottle can be "many times worse than licking your dog's toy" in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with.
The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top, slide-top, squeeze-top, and straw-top.
Each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed.
Your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy.
"Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sq cm)," Treadmill Reviews said.
Slide-top were found to have the highest germ content, with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq) cm on average.
The bottles harboured gram-positive cocci, which can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.
Squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 CFU/sq cm, and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 CFU/sq cm.
"Drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet's dish," the site added.
A far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles, which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 CFU/sq cm.
This may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs.
The germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as "mostly harmless."
"Based on our test results, we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle, both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs," the site said.
We also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
Additionally, water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs.
The site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleach solution.
Religion must either modernise or face obsolescence
In the United States the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the latest polls hold true at election time, America will swear in its first female president in January.
The previous week, across the pond, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from Europe with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.
And young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership.
So is the long and hard battle for women's equality finally over?
Hillary Clinton is poised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sphere women's leadership is still a contentious issue.
Well, not entirely.
In the religious sphere women's leadership remains a contentious issue.
Last week Pope Francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the Jewish Reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s, and the Conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested.
In November 2015, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for Orthodox women's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis.
Not without irony, as Hillary Clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading American Orthodox rabbis opposed to women's ordination launched a series of "hearings" on this disputed subject.
Why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred?
Orthodox Judaism, like most religions, seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values.
This finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society.
Those who oppose women's ordination do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
But the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost.
And the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant.
In The Guns of August, a military history of the First World War, Barbara Tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the "tragedy of the red trousers."
In the lead up to WWI, as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance, it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible.
The British and German armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns.
The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red caps and trousers, marking them out as easy targets.
The suggestion of the French war minister Adolphe Messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance.
The red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.
At a parliamentary hearing, a former war minister, Eugene Etienne, spoke for France.
"Eliminate the red trousers?" he cried.
Never!
"That blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours," wrote Messimy afterwards, "was to have cruel consequences."
Faith leaders grappling with women's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall.
By focusing exclusively on "what is traditional" for their religion rather than asking the crucial question: "What change is necessary for religion to thrive?" they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock.
They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute.
Insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional, but, as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates, it may not be worth the price.

Children from Rojas County learn new skills at camp.
From August 1 to 6 at Rojupe Children and Youth Centre took place a camp called "Rainbow bridges", during which the participants were able to creatively express themselves, participate in sporting activities and learn new skills.
We arrived at the camp on its last day, when the children were having fun painting glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, Specialist on Youth Affairs of Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre, told us that this was one of the activities that the children enjoyed the most.
They also enjoyed their visit to Einārs Kalniņš' carpenter’s shop "Mazbebriņi".
Most of all the children enjoyed the laser engraver, and seeing how a computer slowly applies the original design onto a wooden board.
E. Kalniņš talked about what subjects you need to study at school, if you want to work in carpentry, namely, mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing.
He also pointed out the fact that this profession is more about working with your brain, than with your muscles.
The small workshop receives individual orders, and it is important to plan everything out first.
To get to know each other better, at the beginning of the camp, the participants took part in different games, as well as creating a "coat of arms" together for the camp.
On Wednesday there was held a hike along the sea from Roja to Žocene, along the way were collected natural materials, which were later used for card making.
There were also organised sports games, which were especially important to the participants.
We went to apartment buildings, where we have a sports and recreation ground, to play football and volleyball.
The children love sports activities. We have many boys who play football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sporty to do.
The girls generally enjoy more peaceful activities.
Another day, a nurse helped us to decorate jars, which can be later used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, when children themselves chose who to perform with, with the whole evening devoted to performances.
They also played board games, and everybody could prove their knowledge during photo orienteering, where you have to use a photo as a clue to find an object, and then take a picture of yourself with it.
The task was to pose differently in every picture.
We also coloured mandalas - some enjoyed that more than others did.
There will never be one activity that appeals to everybody - one loves sport, another loves creative activities.
"Now it seems to me that everyone is getting excited about painting glass", explained M. Folkmane.
At the closing of the camp children were awarded with diplomas for creativity, sportiness, and helpfulness - a number of children helped with the running of the camp and chores.
The camp "Rainbow bridges" was established due to the participation of children from three associations - Rojupes and Melnsila child and youth initiatives centre, as well as Rojas county multifunctional centre "Hive".
They are one now unified group.
If the Rojena team invents something faster, we borrow ideas from them; if the contrary, then they borrow from us.
We share our experiences.
This year, the camp involved 30 participants - children who have participated in different activities during the year.
We had already anticipated that there would be 30, and that turned out to be the case", said Mr Folkmane.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It dates back to 2010, when Rojas county social service decided that large families and children from poor families needed summer camps to be organised.
But in the meantime the situation in Roja has improved, and now the camp is intended for residents of the county, who come and work in the youth centres.
The aim is for the kids to spend their free time in a meaningful and interesting way.
Previously two camps were held, each with 20 children, while at the moment due to the fact that the country as a whole has a decreasing number of children, only one camp has needed to be held.
Similar activities are organised for the rest of the year.
Children draw, paint glass, and attended a demonstration by Einars Kalnins, who taught wood engraving, how to build machines from wood, and how to cut different shapes with jigsaws.
There was also a new technique - encaustic painting, which is painting with hot wax chalk.
Teacher Ilze Selkova showed how to use polymer materials, creating pendants and various dishes.
They also made paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseed, and autumn leaves.
We try to use materials that we can find around us.
The youth centre is open in winter from 15.00 to 20.00, in the summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
"In Rude an average of 15 children a day attend the youth centres", says Mr Folkmane.
He emphasises that the majority of support comes from Rojas County Council, who understand the need to allocate funds for children, because they are our future.
Charlton Athletic fan 'can only get season ticket if he signs behavioural contract' and agrees not to badmouth club on social media
Whilst we recognise that everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion, it is not helpful when inflammatory comments are posted on such websites.
The fan, who works in administration, was then told he would have to pick the ticket up in person from former police Chief Inspector Cliff Eager, who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force.
The letter continued: "I need to advise you that the granting of your season ticket will be 'conditioned' and subject to you signing an 'Agreed Behavioural Contract' (ABC) which will request that you refrain from posting derogatory or inflammatory comments regarding the Club or people representing the club in the future on any social media websites, or carrying out any other form of behaviour that could be deemed to be on an anti-social nature."
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after paying for his season ticket, which never showed up and two days later the letter arrived in the post.
Yesterday, he went to the meeting with the club and said: "They told me I had been tweeting excessively and causing other people to tweet as well - which is ridiculous.'
A cycling holiday down the Dalmatian coast
What do you mean, luxury?
I rode my butt off back there," says Colleen, a former US naval commander who has just completed a 25-mile bike ride along the spine of some rugged Croatian island and left nothing out there but a bucketful of sweat and a salvo of salty naval expletives hurled at the hostile hills.
Some cyclists sing hymns or recite nursery rhymes as a climbing aid.
Colleen's friend Patty recommends The Little Engine That Could.
Others count revolutions or just suffer in silence, wondering what it takes to enter the trance-like state of which hardened cyclists speak.
Colleen swears, with more venom than variety.
Cycling a few yards ahead of her is like being pursued by Hugh Grant in the opening sequence of Four Weddings and a Funeral.
Her mission and mine is a week-long "luxury" boat and bike tour of Croatia's north Dalmatian coast and islands, organised by Freedom Treks.
Cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as Croatia might not fit everyone's idea of luxury, but north Dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south, our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week, the brand new Melody.
At the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides Ivan and Ivana to stow, and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins, sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that Croatians call a beach.
In late June the sea is a perfect temperature, all agree: cool enough to refresh, but not cold.
The Melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle.
Instead, most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have made our beds, restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table.
Ivan says stretching is important after cycling, and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with Antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails.
The Melody, at 42m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates, is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser.
She turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to her.
Colleen and Patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from Washington DC: the Over 45 Sport and Socials, they call themselves.
Last year's barge and bike holiday in the Netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in Croatia.
A rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive Facebook postings.
The adventure element of the holiday can be overstated, because our schedule is nothing if not regimented.
"Breakfast and dinner are at eight o'clock," Ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split.
One ring of the ship's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing.
"Good moaning!" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British contingent.
Who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast, while Ivana hands out sketch maps of the day's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles, contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Completely flat is not recommended.
Ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text, switching fluently between English and German.
Some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with, but we are an easy group - Swiss, German, American and British - which divides easily at mealtimes into two English speaking tables, one German.
On the road we are all friends.
Cycling breeds camaraderie, and the only competition is with the terrain, which is to say ourselves.
I can't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic.
We soon tune in to Ivan's wave length.
A stiff climb is an incline, not to be confused with an undulation, which is a good thing.
Hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on: simple but not always easy.
Cycling instructions are always the same: "Single file, keep your distance, and it's not a race.
We meet on the quay at nine.
OK, five past - you're on holiday, I forgot.
Take lots of water.
From Trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the Kornati archipelago, where we ride most of the length of Dugi Otok - Croatian for "long island" - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the Telašćica Nature Park, to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel.
It is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it.
If we paddle, will our legs feel younger and stronger?
At the small island of Molat we turn south again, hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion.
Most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg: olive groves, vineyards, prickly herbal scrub; Mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing.
While we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when Ivan calls a halt, and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals.
The Sport and Socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette, sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely.
"You were nearly a hood ornament there," one cyclist tells another, after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard.
Fortunately they worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads, with Ivana at the very back to encourage and "scoop up," as Ivan puts it.
And if a main road must be crossed we all assemble, dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side, as instructed and not before.
"Do you think Ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children?" a Swiss cyclist asks, as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross.
Our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness.
A city tour at Zadar reveals remains of a Roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster, through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water.
Zadar's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor, in fact.
When Melody sets sail for the lively resort of Biograd in the early morning, the organ's song is no more than a whisper.
Day five is entirely free of cycling.
A boat trip up the Krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Sibenik with its domed cathedral, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local speciality, coral - make for an interesting day.
Lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks
People gather during the annual Catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of Notre Dame de Lourdes.
French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics converge on the shrine of Lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks.
Each year, tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the Pyrenees for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, marking the ascent of the Virgin Mary into Heaven.
This year's pilgrimage comes as Catholics reel from the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamist extremists, who stormed his church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat.
Jacques Hamel's murder came under two weeks after a Tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people.
Many in France are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months.
With tourist arrivals in the country plummeting, authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage would be sharply down.
But fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge.
Around 25,000 faithful are expected, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity.
Many pilgrims say they will not be cowed.
"We're not going to stop living," Christian, a 66-year-old visitor, told AFP, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the face of violence.
"It's important to show that life goes on," said Matthieu Guignard, one of the coordinators.
It's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith, our beliefs, our way of living.
Several major events have been cancelled in France since the Nice attack over security concerns, including a huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European road cycling championships that had been set to take place in Nice in September.
"For the past week, my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations," Fabien Lejeusne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend.
Instead, the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful, he said, reporting a last-minute bookings spurt.
The head of the local hotel workers' union, Christian Gelis, confirmed signs of "increased interest" in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks.
Security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to Bernadette Soubirous, a poor shepherd girl, in 1858.
Around 250 police and two dozen soldiers, including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs, have been deployed to protect the area.
Pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three.
Catherine Simcox, who made a pilgrimage from the north east of England to Lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security.
"By Thursday morning, there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal barriers) with bags being searched on the way in," she told The Local.
"This total freaked my three kids out who are used to Lourdes & it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It didn't spoil my experience, but it saddened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reassured by the measures.
The route of Friday's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of Lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary, it will start and end at the shrine.
Other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above Lourdes to flights, closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on Saturday.
Lourdes attracts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Catholic pilgrimage in the world.
Many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives, who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where Bernadette said she saw Mary, believing the water to have healing properties.
Thierry Castillo, another of the organisers, described this year's gathering as "a bit unusual" given "the threat that seems to have taken root in France."
But "it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experience," he assured.
Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims, admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues "a little overwhelming."
But if it reassures everyone, it's good.
Two injured in Zaragoza shopping centre shooting
Two people have been seriously injured after a man opened fire at a shopping centre in Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.

The opening of the waterfowl hunting season is approaching.
Every year, the second Saturday of August is the opening for the waterfowl hunting season.
This year it starts on August 13th at16:00, so the State Police calls for both the hunters and citizens to be especially careful and follow safety rules.
Waterfowl hunting takes place not only in hunting areas, but also around public bodies of water, and while the weather does not promise burning heat as in other years, it is accepted that both vacationers and hunters will use these bodies of water.
Both hunters and vacationers and people who live near by are called to be particularly vigilant of lakes and rivers and follow safety rules, so as not to endanger themselves or others.
As in previous years, it has been observed that in the first days of the season opening, waterfowl hunters engage in a large number, so this year the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will strengthen their control of the situation.
Law enforcers will focus attention on controlling the movement of arms and ammunition in compliance with the provisions of the Law, as well as monitoring that no one uses alcohol or becomes intoxicated during hunting.
Police recalls when hunting waterfowl, it is prohibited to use semi-automatic guns, with cartridge chambers and magasines of a total capacity of more than three rounds, and draw attention to the amendments of the movement of weapons and special tools law, in particular Article 22 (91) part of which states that persons with long firearms or high-power pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sports, and short stop time of up to two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, have the right during hunting to store guns and ammunition in the vehicle, but they must be placed in the safest possible case or other package containing the ammunition or weapon, which is not visible from outside the vehicle, located behind a locked door and equipped with an alarm device, thus ensuring that they are not accidentally placed in the hands of unauthorised persons.
Police call for respect of the safety and the security of fellow citizens in the hunting season, and if you see any violations of the law or any threat to security, to call 110 immediately to make a report.
In any event of danger, law enforcers are ready to respond to the information provided by residents
The coast of New Caledonia shakes with a 7.2 magnitude earthquake
On Friday the New Caledonia coast shook with a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, seismologists said, pointing out that there is no threat from a tsunami.
The epicenter of the earthquake was at a depth of nine-kilometers, 109 kilometers to the east of New Caledonia in Ilantera at1.26 am Greenwich time4.26 Latvia time, informed the US Geological Survey research centre.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre pointed out that they currently do not have any warnings or recommendations in relation to potential tsunamis in the region.
"Earthquakes in this region, as we know, are not unusual, and this kind of activity in recent times is not unusual", said the "Geoscience Australia" research centre senior seismologist Phil Kamins.
Potentially it could be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia islands, but I doubt if it is so powerful as to be able to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the "Circle of fire" - the Pacific tectonic activity area where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree on the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela have agreed to open the checkpoints at the border, which was closed a year ago on the Venezuelan initiative, the Colombian and Venezuelan presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday.
Border crossing points will be open only to pedestrians.
Starting from Saturday, every day from 8 am until 8pm, five border crossings will be open.
The possibility of borders being opened to vehicle transport will be the subject of special bilateral agreements on security, trade and energy, said the president.
Last year in August Maduro ordered the closure of the border, in a response to the Colombian militant attack on the Venezuelan border patrols.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were wounded in the attack.
In July this year Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice due to a sharp economic crisis - poverty-stricken Venezuelans tried to break through the border, in order to buy basic necessities at shops on the border.
This opportunity was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.

"Facebook" declares a fight against ad blockers.
The world's most used social network Facebook has broadcast a warning shot, leading to believe that ad-blocking, by using special tools, it is not acceptable and all users are going to have to watch advertising.
Special ad blocker popularity is growing, but it means that companies, whose main source of income is from advertising, are suffering from decreased revenue.
Facebook acknowledges that advertising can be annoying, but expresses that users will have to learn to live with them anyway.
However, they will be provided with tools to be able to choose themselves what type of materials appear, reports the BBC.
"As people have more options for control, we'll start sending ads to those using ad-blocking software," said Facebook advertising business vice president Andrew Bosworth.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of ads they see by selecting the brands and the sectors that they find interesting.
"People do not like to see ads that they are not interested in or that interfere with their enjoyment of content," added Bosworth.
Ad blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, of which Facebook has the largest attendance, but the resulting banner exposure reduction just in terms of money is measured in billions.
According to BBC information, advertising blockers are used by about 200 million people.
As reported in the previous business year quarter Facebook advertising revenues were 6.2 billion US dollars or 5.55 billion euros.
It should be noted that this is not the first time that Facebook has been actively involved in determining what network users see in their news feeds.
As one of the last steps Facebook has just started to take action to remove from news feeds, or at least limit "loud" titles, behind which actually lie "empty" messages.

Deputy Medvedev secretly met in Riga with several ZZS ministers.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Deputy Arkady Dvorkovics last week while visiting Riga, secretly met with three of the Greens and Farmers Union (Zaļo un zemnieku savienības, ZZS) ministers in a fish processing plant.
Informal meetings at the fish processing plant "The Seagull", also involved the participation of the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, the Transport Minister Uldis Augulis and the Minister of Agriculture Janis Duklavs, reports internet portal "skaties.lv".
Reizniece-Ozola confirmed the fact that such a meeting took place.
She explained that during the meeting they discussed the lifting of sanctions for fish processors, as well as the Incukalns gas storage.
The meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice took place without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The meeting organiser was Russian Ambassador Alexander Veshnyakov.
An accountant has been detained, suspected of embezzling more than €130,000.
State Police (SP) Economic Crime Administration (ENAP) this month detained an accountant suspected of embezzling 130 thousand euros from a Riga commercial company after working for the company for 20 years, the BNS agency informed VP spokeswoman Gita Gibovska.
Current information suggests that the female is suspected of illegal activity carried out over several years, altogether causing the company more than 130 thousands of euros in losses.
Given that the company officials had not been rigorous in tracking cash flow and trusted their employee, it took them several years to notice the missing funds.
VP ENAP police this month arrested the woman, born in 1963, for conducting fraud.
Criminal proceedings continue under the name of embezzlement, due to the fraud being committed on a large scale.
For such a crime the law provides for imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, with confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently wearing a security tag, which is not a deprivation of liberty.
In Estonia Zika virus antibodies have been detected in nine people.
Estonia analysed nine people identified with Zika virus antibodies, which means that they can be brought into contact with the infection, according to the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
Laboratory information provided proof that this year Zika virus tests had conducted 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
Estonia's neighbouring countries Finland and Sweden have identified their first cases of Zika.
The Estonian Health Bureau data shows that no acute Zika virus infection case in the country has been established and if flu-like symptoms occur, people do not need to take a Zika virus test, but they should visit their family doctor.
We found IgG (immunoglobulin G class) antibodies, showing that the test person was infected at some point with Zika or a similar virus.
"It does not mean that the patient was ill with Zika virus," explained the head of the infectious disease department at "Synlab" laboratory, Paul Naber.
The Zika virus is transmitted by the "Aedes" genus of mosquitoes.
Latvian has a problem with quality automotive purchasing development, said Auto Association Vice president Ingus Rutins in an interview with the news agency BNS .
When asked whether the auto purchasing industry has noticeable problems with dumping prices, Rutins answered in the affirmative.
But of course.
Automobile purchases are distinct from purchasing of maintenance services, where prices are easier to manipulate.
With cars you have to pay a fixed amount, as you are obliged to buy them from the manufacturer.
Nevertheless, there is a problem here, which can be divided into two parts.
Either the purchase announcer is incompetent and does not know how to create a high-quality purchase, and as a result is often unknowingly, "shopped".
"Or very conscious procurement is carried out, in order to receive something concrete, and then all kinds of miracles can be witnessed", stated the Auto association Vice president.
He noted that currently it is popular to talk about moving away from the lowest bid on the most economically advantageous tender as procurement criteria for determining the winner, but the public still have false ideas about these kinds of issues.
Now it is very popular - let's move away from the lowest prices towards the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria should be established in both cases, and when they are taken into account and evaluated, the decision is taken at the principle of the lowest price.
Technical criteria for qualitative procurement should be very accurate and relevant to the market.
In turn, the points do not need to judge anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
You do not need to use points to evaluate fuel consumption, emissions, maintenance services and similar things.
You need to know the car life cycle, mileage, etc., then you can easily assess the overall picture.
"The question then is just about which of the scenarios the client themselves interested in?" explained Rutins.
In turn, the Auto association project manager Peter Rubulis noted that the problems are related to the fact that often one and the same person makes purchases for cars, as well as for work gloves, and food and these purchases are derived from the same sample.
We have brought to the consultation also purchasing of sample spare parts which otherwise was difficult to name as an absurd example.
"The problem is that the procurement compiler very often lacks any understanding of the subject of procurement and simply copies the requirements from somewhere", admitted Rubulis.
Rutins added - the smaller the structure, which announces the procurement, the greater the problems they tend to have.
"Apparently it is precisely because of the lack of human resources and expertise," said the Vice president of the association.

"Die Antwoord" accuses "Suicide squad" of stealing their style.
The South African group "Die Antwoord" on Thursday accused the director of the film "Suicide sqaud", for using their unique style without permission, calling the famous director a "scared lil bitch".
The leading singer Yolandi used the "Instagram" mobile app to write to the films "Warner Bros." director, stating: "yes David Ayer u jockin our style".
As she claims, the film stars Kara Delvigne and Jared Leto told her that Ayer was inspired by "Die Antwoord" during filming.
"But u never asked our permision to rip us off", stated the singer.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja addressed a message on this isue to Ayer, but "when ninja texted u sayin wassup wif dat u said nothin like a scared lil bitch".
Jolanda insists that Ayer borrowed scenes from the 2011 short film "Umshini Wam" intro, showing the South African hip-hop duo.
She also published a video allegedly showing that Ayers Joker and Harley Quins images were borrowed from the two singers' appearances.
But Leto insists that the inspiration for the Joker's image is based on the rock star David Bowie's image.
Yolandi made her claim after the harsh critical reviews the film earned after the premiere.
Yolandi and Ninja, real names Anri du Toit and Watkin Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rap studio recordings, promoting African "Zef" counterculture.
Today's liveliest gypsy swing and jazz guitarist group "The Rosenberg Trio" (from the Netherlands) will be heard for the first time in Latvia this evening, August 12th, at the "Summertime" festival - Inese Galante.

Turkey seeks missing diplomats following coup attempt
Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats who failed to return to Turkey in a recall of personnel following a July 15 coup attempt.
Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Friday that 208 members of Turkey's ministry staff were recalled to Ankara from posts around the world in an inquiry regarding the coup attempt, and 32 remain missing "without permission."
About 18,000 civil servants, military leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended from their positions in Turkey, the government believing their loyalties lie with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of masterminding the attempt to overthrow the government.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's most-wanted list.
Cavosoglu said a U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
The issue has become a problem for the United States in its dealings with Turkey, a NATO member.
The United States has objected to the strong-arm tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup, and Turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with Russia.
Cavosoglu said two Turkish military attaches in Greece fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia but was sent back and two generals in Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He added two civil servants in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one in Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, added Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official familiar with the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer stationed at a Virginia NATO command center requested asylum in the United States.
There are those who have escaped.
There have been escapees among our diplomats as well," Cavosoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview.
As of yesterday, time has run out for those initially called back.
We will carry out the legal operations for those who have not returned.
Olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool
Olympic divers planning to practice Friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Games.
The water suddenly changed color Tuesday, midway through the synchronized diving events.
Officials insisted the water was safe for competing, even after a larger, adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green.
The diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups, though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the start of the women's 3-meter event.
The water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green.
American diver Abby Johnston, who is competing on the springboard, said she showed up for her warmup, only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp" should start trending.
British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in the synchro platform event, also commented on the state of the pool in a Twitter post.
Hopefully that means we haven't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days!
Mario Andrada, chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for competition, clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries.
He conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool.
"We reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes," he said.
In the first day of this water situation, one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy.
This was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools.
We reduced immediately the quantity.
We retested the water and it was totally within the parameters.
Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning.
He said the decision was supported by world governing body FINA.
"The reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in a statement.
Andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool's deteriorating condition.
"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, went longer than expected.
Rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal.
"The rain doesn't help," Andrada said.
He added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning, but conceded that "was not ideal."
He explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels, much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly.
When we went to fix the green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.
We certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green.
Once it turned green, we again made another bit of a mistake.
AP Sports Writers Jay Cohen and Steve Wade in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.
Shanghai, Taipei to hold forum despite cross-Strait communication suspension
Shanghai and Taipei will hold their annual city forum from Aug. 22-23 in Taipei, Shanghai municipal authorities announced Friday, despite current suspension of cross-Strait communication mechanisms.
Senior municipal official Sha Hailin, on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong, will lead a delegation to attend the forum, the Shanghai government announced via its official microblog account on Sina Weibo.
The forum has been held by the two cities in rotation since 2010.
The 2016 forum will focus on exchanges in fields such as health care, smart cities, culture and transportation in a bid to "deepen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, according to the Shanghai government.
The Taiwan side has failed to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which endorses the one-China principle, since new leader Tsai Ing-wen assumed office in May, leading to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office on the mainland, said Friday that the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations can be maintained as long as the Taiwan side adheres to the political foundation of the 1992 Consensus.
"We hold an active and open attitude toward exchanges between cities of both sides," Ma said, stressing that the nature of cross-Strait relations and city exchanges should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan president meets Chinese FM, anticipates closer cooperation
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and wished for closer cooperation while meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who has sided with Africa during the continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development, Museveni said.
The president cited the Tanzania-Zambia Railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of China's generous support even when China was by then not so prosperous itself.
China has carried out multifaceted cooperation with Uganda, ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges, Museveni said, adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to Uganda's long-term development than simply providing aids.
He hopes China can, through various ways, join in Uganda's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks.
He also welcomes more Chinese to invest and travel in Uganda.
Wang Yi hailed the progress Uganda has made in industrialization and agricultural modernization, adding that China will continue to play the role of Uganda's most reliable and ideal cooperation partner.
China stands ready to try its best in helping Uganda pursue economic and social development, Wang said, noting that Sino-Ugandan cooperation is sincere and without any political strings attached as it is based on high-level political trust and time-tested friendship.
He said China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda on construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, and support the east African nation to develop its energy and agriculture sectors.
