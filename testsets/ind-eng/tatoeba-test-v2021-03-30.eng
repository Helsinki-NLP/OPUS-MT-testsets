You just made my day.
Old people are usually very wise.
When Marcus arrived, I was sleeping.
I can't bend my right arm.
I am hungry.
Yoko avoided answering my question.
Tom is very different from his father.
Like father, like son.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom pointed to the floor.
Recently he's become a really nice person.
He is from France.
Tom knows he hears something.
Health is worth more than gold.
I'll be glad to help him.
It's fun to learn about foreign cultures.
When did you start wearing contacts?
Tom won't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I think you've been trying to contact us.
Undaunted, he refused to give up.
I'll try to write about ethnic and religious minorities.
I must have made a mistake.
I ran into an old friend.
The knife was so blunt that I could not cut the meat with it and I resorted to my pocket knife.
He is blind in one eye.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom is forgetful.
Where have you been?
Traffic lights are used to regulate traffic.
Don't let Tom look at these pictures.
This room gets little sunshine.
He is painting a picture.
I shouldn't have run that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I make it a rule not to sit up late.
The smell was terrible.
A sentence is a sentence.
There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
It was not until yesterday that I knew it.
You can buy it at the bookshop.
Let's take the Intercity-Express.
Many thanks.
Yes!
My sister is fond of music.
Tom has always been a very easy person to get along with.
Shall we go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What is wrong with you?
I think I can come over this afternoon.
"It was worth the two-hour wait." "Yeah! I'll cherish this signature for a lifetime."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
I only told Tom what Mary told me.
Where there is smoke there is fire.
You'll never find the way back home, through narrow streets of cobblestone.
Tom certainly wasn't at home when we went to visit him.
Mary is a pretty girl.
That man is driving a car.
A lot of birthday cards will arrive soon.
Read it once more, please.
When is a good time for you?
I am just kidding.
Tom narrowly escaped being hit.
I went, too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The fee includes the payment for professional services needed to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logograms, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
The two cases aren't related.
How could I not see this coming?
What's this called?
I stayed home because it was raining.
That's the right answer.
Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can.
To me, there aren't any fundamental differences between the cultures of these two countries.
He was cheating.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he was absent.
That was probably what influenced their decision.
The rain lasted through the night.
Tom is getting jealous.
Let me drive you home.
Wasn't it awful?
I'll get this bag for you.
The cake is too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
It is our obligation to help.
How did you like the party?
I'm still not ready.
Mary declined an invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He sat surrounded by his grandchildren.
The child soon fell asleep in the bed.
Jim is not yet used to driving on the left side of the road.
He was immersed in the puzzle.
The man passed away a few hours ago.
How about eating out with me?
It seemed like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We found the front door locked.
May I speak to Mr. Sato?
This water is odourless.
Mr. Smith is an acquaintance of hers.
Thank you for your interest.
We've got major problems.
I don't get you at all.
He is afraid to fly in an airplane.
I suspected that he was telling a lie, but that didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice. I have to do this now.
I cannot finish reading this thick book in a week.
Timing is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We had a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
I'm not sure what else I should do.
We've done what we can.
Do you have any further questions?
You'll never be alone.
Walking along the street, I met the lady.
Are you not able to speak English?
We are all equal before the law, but the rich often have a big advantage.
He is certain to succeed.
I like cats.
The meeting finished at nine.
Tom is mentally disturbed.
Could it be that I am crazy?
We had an especially difficult winter.
I should ask, shouldn't I?
Let's find a solution that is acceptable to everyone.
Everyone makes mistakes.
You'd better tell Tom not to do that.
My mother has been dead these ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go get help.
It's six degrees below zero.
Where were they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
Nothing is the matter with the car. It's just that you are a bad driver.
May I see your claim tags?
He was absorbed in reading.
Tom married a girl much younger than himself.
He's a carbon copy of his father.
She has a nice line in self-deprecation.
I may be plump, but I'm vigorous.
He tried to kill himself but it ended in failure.
Do you have a light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I'm reincarnated, I want to come back as a cat.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
She is a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill hasn't come yet.
Laurie is slim.
They suggested to him that he go alone.
Tom is a good man.
I'll call back in twenty minutes.
They swim.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom played a trick on Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students go on to university.
Tom put the pencil down on the desk.
I do not want to talk about it anymore.
Tom lowered his voice so no one else could hear.
Have you seen something?
What are you all looking at?
Does he have long hair?
She greets him every morning as he enters the school building.
I think he is a doctor.
That slope is very steep, better go through the left side.
We didn't actually see the accident.
His mother is worried about him.
What operas are being performed at the Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom was murdered by Mary.
His data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We have a reservation for six-thirty.
We named the dog Tim.
She opened the letter quickly.
Where is the train station?
Tom motioned for Mary to follow him.
It is already eleven.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting dark.
I got tired.
All who knew him admired him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train has just left.
Those folks are insane!
