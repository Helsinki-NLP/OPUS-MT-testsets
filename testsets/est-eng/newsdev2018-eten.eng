Two Powerhouse Women Share Their Secrets for Success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
On paper, the women are from two very different worlds.
New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank.
Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume.
Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel stereotyped by society into specific roles and expectations.
So they launched The Maxx You Project aimed at helping women break those barriers.
Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman.
Corcoran earned straight D's in high school and college, hopped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23.
Ali entered one of the most male-dominated industries and had the added struggle of carving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global icon father.
To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.
So we sat down with the two powerhouses to talk overcoming failure, navigating success and trusting their gut instincts in business and relationships.
What inspires both of you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I'm inspired on a daily basis by my personal goals.
I make it a habit to write down what it is that I want to accomplish.
And I check that list.
I keep myself accountable.
My kids inspire me, of course.
My ambition inspires me.
I want to win at everything that I do in life.
I understand that it takes hard work to reach my goals and I'm prepared to do it.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of my time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Much like Laila, over preparation is my key to confidence, but I don't get my inspiration from that.
I really get my inspiration from just sheer curiosity.
What will happen if I do this?
What won't happen if I don't do this?
That curiosity gets my feet on the floor in the morning, because I can't wait to see what the day brings.
When I don't feel that way on certain days, I pretend I feel that way.
Then I start falling for my own baloney and I get inspired again.
Tell us about a hurdle or a roadblock in your career that ended up making you better in the long run?
Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing that happened to me was when my business partner and boyfriend left me and married my secretary.
I ended the business a year later, but for that year of my life - being the third wheel - it was terrible, because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt shot down, uninspired.
But amazing things happen.
If only you could believe that when you're getting hit, which is the hard part.
But getting back up and starting the business all over again, minus the partner, was a very, very difficult year.
Laila Ali: I would say one of the toughest times I've had in my career was when I was in boxing, I was at the height of my career and decided I was going to get a divorce.
I was divorcing not only my husband, but also my manager at the time and the person who taught me everything I knew about boxing.
I didn't think that I could do it without him.
So I became concerned about the future of my career and had to take the time to step back and say, "Hey, you have all the knowledge and expertise.
You have all this experience in the ring.
You can definitely do it."
So I surrounded myself with a new team of people and continued on with my career.
It was really just getting my mindset in the right place because everything kind of took off from there.
I did what I needed to do and I had to face that fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and my manager and continue on with my career and it worked out.
You felt like you really made it when ...
Laila Ali: I felt like I really made it when I won my first championship title.
It really felt good, because when I entered the sport of boxing I wanted to be one of the best and be undefeated.
And I was able to attain that, not just one championship title, but four.
Barbara Corcoran: The one point that I felt like I made it was my eleventh year of business.
I finally made a profit.
I had close to $42,000 in profit that I was not expecting.
So I immediately went out and I bought my mother and father each a new car; they had never had a new car and I had it delivered to Florida where they were retired.
I felt like the queen of England.
I felt so cool about myself.
I made much better money than that in ensuing years, but nothing ever measured up to the ability to give back to a parent and take them by surprise.
How did you stay motivated to keep working during that 11-year period?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit, because that's not what I was in for.
I just wanted to see how far I could go.
I set my dream, day one, "I want to be the queen of New York real estate."
And I pictured myself just like the Pope with everybody kissing my ring and adoring me.
And I had that little idea in my head.
So when I was running hard, day after day, hour after hour, I never really thought about making money.
I made money by accident eventually.
But any money I saw coming in, I plowed right back into the business.
I don't even think I had discouraging days where I thought, "Oh God, we're not making money."
I just figured something was going to work out.
The worst that could happen is I lose my company and go back to being a waitress.
I made great tips and I was happy then.
I could be happy again.
So I don't think money's a great aspiration for a lot of people that succeed.
They they have other motivations that turn them on.
And money was not one of mine.
Do you have advice for someone who has those big dreams, but the money factor is holding them back?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have the time.
I was building a business.
And so I found myself five different partners, who were specialists not even in the brokerage business, in different neighborhoods around the city, who knew their streets inside and out.
And I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you be my partner."
The lesson here is if you've got the money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have the talent, you can always merchandise your talent to someone who's got the money and make money.
There's two pieces to it: talent and money.
And unless they're together, nothing really big happens.
So I wound up doing very well, as did my partners, over all the years with these great investors that I would have never had if I hadn't had the confidence to get some scrappy person who really wanted to hustle.
You can always get the money if you believe that you have a talent and you know your piece of the world better than anybody else.
Let's talk morning routine: What are two or three things that you do every single morning that set you up for success?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but there are lots of times in my life where I feel overwhelmed, just being a mom, a businesswoman, a wife ... all the hats that we wear as women.
And I came to a point in my life where I really had to establish a morning routine.
I like to wake up and just feel gratitude.
Gratitude for waking up, for my health, for my kids, for my family.
A lot of times in the evening, I'll write down what my goals are for the next day; When I wake up, I look at that list again.
I meditate.
Sometimes I journal.
I always have a cup of coffee.
I always work out first thing in the morning, because if I don't, it won't get done.
To me, it really comes down to your priorities.
Because those are the things that are important to me: my spirituality, centering with the universe and God, and then getting my workout in and putting my health first.
That makes everything else feel easy.
Anything that comes up, I feel like I can conquer it throughout the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I do prioritize.
I just go through my to-do list, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I put down what my A's are.
What are the real priorities?
And I try to be okay with just accomplishing the A's.
What do you do to psych yourself up for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I picture myself failing.
As weird as that is.
I think, "Oh my God, I'm going to fail."
I scare the living daylights out of myself and that gets me running hard.
I picture whoever is going to compete with me, and I'm so fiercely competitive by nature, because I'm one of ten kids and we could never get my parents' attention.
I get competitive.
And I always arrive very over prepared.
Over preparation for me is my confidence builder.
Laila Ali: It's amazing that we're so opposite on that.
We're two successful people and it just goes to show how different things work for different people.
For me, I like to imagine being successful.
I like to imagine the end, which is success.
I envision it, where I can actually see it happening.
Going into the ring, seeing the fight happen, seeing me winning that belt, seeing me back in my dressing room celebrating with a slice of cake, which I always had.
And the same with meetings.
I do prepare though; that confidence comes from preparation, because that fear is in the back of your head of not doing well, of not saying the right thing or having the right information.
That's where the preparation comes in for me.
But I always go in seeing the end result.
Both of you have seen so much success in your own careers.
How are you paying it forward?
Laila Ali: I am so excited to be a part of the T.J. Maxx Maxx You Project, because I feel like this is a way of paying it forward and giving back.
There's so many women that need to be inspired, encouraged to go after their dreams, their goals, their aspirations.
Because we all have that champion within us.
It really is about your mindset and having the tools that you need, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to achieve some of the things that you want to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One of the things that I think I do very, very well is inspire people.
So in being asked to partner with the Maxx You Project, I was thrilled.
I'm hoping to light the fire of individuality and the inspiration that we're seeing here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
A lot of people can start with a dream, and then somewhere along the way, they get lost.
So we're going to try to focus them.
Everything's practical we're teaching.
Business planning, even something as simple as an elevator pitch, all the things that you need to build a business.
What specific advice do you have for women who working to succeed in male-dominated industries?
Laila Ali: I am in one of the number one male-dominated industries, boxing.
And then coming behind my father, who was a global icon and the greatest of all time, was pretty intimidating.
So for me, it was really about finding that talent, that courage, that strength within myself.
The first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could actually get in that ring and be successful.
It wasn't about anybody else, but me in that moment, and there weren't going to be any limits on me, except those that I had on myself in my own mind.
When you believe in yourself and you find your passion, nobody can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: There's a long distance between being inspired and having a view like I did, "The queen of New York real estate," and actually running it over to the finish line.
And there's so many talents you need in that in-between stage, which is every day of your working career.
You don't have to be in the real estate brokerage business to need those talents.
I'm sure in Laila's field, you had to judge the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to stop, how much money you had, what you could enter, what you couldn't enter, how hard you wanted to work.
These are all judgment calls.
And I think I'm going to try to put a little flesh on the aspiration, for these women to really feel like, "Okay, I got it now.
Let me run.
And here are my top three priorities."
If they leave with top three priorities to actually make it happen, I will go home tonight smiling as I go to bed.
What is sitting on your nightstand right now?
Laila Ali: Too much junk.
Magazines, books, a little prayer angel, my journal.
Probably a bottle of water.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightstand has a little green wind-up alarm clock, because I was trying to break the habit of looking at my phone first thing in the morning.
So I got it.
It was adorable.
It has never run.
And it's still sitting there.
And I still have my phone on my nightstand.
What book are you reading right now?
Barbara Corcoran: How To Win Friends and Influence People for the eighth time, maybe the ninth.
It keeps you on the straight and narrow.
I think it's still the best book written in the industry no matter what your dream is because you can't get to any of your dreams without people.
And it resonates as real today as it ever did.
I like to read it every once in awhile.
Gets me straightened out again.
Laila Ali: I'm in nutrition school, so I'm reading a book called Wheat Belly.
It just talks about eating grains and how they affect our bodies.
I'm totally into it.
What is your best tip on navigating success and failure?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the naysayers.
Naysayers come in all different forms.
You have to eliminate them from your brain vocabulary.
Steer clear of complainers.
They suck your energy.
I think of complainers as thieves.
They come in the night, they grab your wallet and they leave.
Naysayers in any kind of a team situation will ruin the team faster than you could blink an eye because people who are at a pity party need other people to feel sorry with.
They suck other good people down.
I'm excellent at avoiding anyone who's negative 50 miles away, because I plan on being positive and getting everything I want out of life and giving everything I can to life.
And so why would I want to spend a minute with anybody like that?
Laila Ali: Be consistent.
So many times, we're like, "We're going to be on the straight and narrow.
We're going to do X, Y and Z."
And people don't do it for long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they make it over that final hump.
So I think that you have to stay the course.
If you're passionate about something, you believe in it, then you have to be consistent.
And you have to put in the hard work that it takes to be successful.
Barbara Corcoran: It's a lot of hard work to be consistent.
You know what being consistent takes?
It takes finishing.
You start it, you finish it.
So many people are good at starts and not so good at finishing.
The most non-citizens in Latvia live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja
Riga is home to 125,344 people who lack Latvian citizenship, Daugavpils to 14,266 and Liepāja to 11,909.
Outside the big cities, the greatest number of people who lack Latvian citizenship live in Jēkabpils (2,347) and Valmiera (1,235).
In early 2017, 242,560 people who lacked Latvian citizenship lived in Latvia.
In 2007, 392,816 people who lacked Latvian citizenship lived in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently said on Facebook: “A quote is a poor excuse.”
Therefore I won’t look back and try to recall what has been done historically to re-program human nature and what results have been achieved.
I won’t judge whether these attempts can be considered successes or failures.
I’ll also avoid excessive references to sources, even though I will proceed from the idea of my most important teacher Toomas Paul: all of my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere, if I could only remember from where exactly.
The most conspicuous state project going on in Estonia right now is the re-education of citizens of the Republic of Estonia – into perfect people.
We don’t raise them like we raise a child – in good faith that the child will become a person.
We raise them the way the ruling class imagines it – what a person has to be like in order to be allowed to live in Estonia and speak publicly.
Censorship is total.
Although the local ruling class changed partially a year ago, some educational methods are just as frightening as the ones of the previous ruling class, the now impoverished nobility – their brutality in no way falls short of the previous ones.
They’re just different.
Latvian beer is the emblematic beverage of our new era of making fine adjustments.
BAC of 0.05% obligatory for government officials
The ruling class doesn’t include only the politicians who are paid salary by the state, but also the self-aware people who engage in politics voluntarily (read: intentionally), wrote opinion provocations after the example of Mihkel Mutt, curse out their peers on Facebook as to how awful people around them here in degenerate Estonia live, picket, boycott, juggle, and sabotage.
They’re willing to live only in an echo chamber (the English-speaker’s word for people who live in a space where they hear only opinions they like to hear, such as their own Facebook friends etc.) but this is not possible in conflicted Estonia.
There’s always someone among us who thinks or does something that is intolerable for the echo chamber folk.
And the war of words breaks out and the flame cannons thunder.
We have very many politicians who know exactly How much a person should drink, whom they should sleep with, how many children they should spawn, how much money to make, went to go on vacation, what to think about, what to eat, how to entertain themselves, when to be sick, when to die.
In very important positions.
If they’re public comments are met by anything other than what they themselves sad, they are furious, insulted, offended hysterical.
The fact that in a number of European countries, people drive around in a car, head full of booze, and this is legal, doesn’t shake their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only allowed deviant behaviour in every municipality, but it’s not compassion and care that is behind zero tolerance, but rather outright evil.
Class hatred and racial hatred – only people like me are the right ones.
The saintly politicians are only able to open their mouth, but neve their heart.
They believe that every “measure” that they make society better with works and is worth trying.
Luckily for them, we have a big enough bunch of claqueurs, stunt men with a deficit of spirit who leap through every window – without feeling any pain.
For that reason, it seems to us that if some clever peasant opens their mouth and is beat emotionally senseless in the manor stable for it, this is in fact reasonable.
Some words that will definitely send us to the manor stable are homo, refugee, woman, violence, get to work, among many others.
If we believed everything that the selfless officials, activists and politicians (such people make up only a small part of all groups, but they are able to shout so loud so that the whole society becomes deaf), talk and write that citizens are not only nasty, vulgar and unpleasant but also mindless, with no brains.
But don’t believe them, don’t force them to tolerate it, don’t prohibit drinking.
People in Estonia drink as much as they want, not as much as the state allows.
Estonian people tolerate much more if they aren’t forced to tolerate things.
Estonian people won’t change their behaviour two months before the elections so that after the aim is achieved they can turn their back on their fad diet and yet again let in and also out of their mouth whatever quickly puts on the pounds in the form of fat on their brain.
Whoever does anything different is not a proper Estonian.
I don’t think that any person can be re-educated.
I believe that people can be taught.
To drink in moderation, to love their family, to be industrious, polite, charming companion not just to their friends but to all of society.
To teach, it isn’t necessary to mete out fines, lay siege to, prohibit, coerce, call to order, make stand in a corner, hurl rotten eggs at people while they’re in the media stockade.
A teacher has to be a role model.
A politician who smokes talks about how harmful tobacco is?
A policeman who speeds when he’s off duty is fining me for speeding?
And then gets caught by a co-worker drunk…
I have this rogue idea that maybe we should try to re-educate the ruling class, too.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
If you drink, drink publicly: On Town Hall Square, before the eyes of everyone.
To force them to exceed the speed limit only publicly – let the rulers’ cars, and private cars, too, all be red.
If you govern, govern as if you were governing yourself.
Maybe the shame will be sufficient if your words and deeds don’t align.
Or will we learn that we ourselves want the most debased to govern us.
Because all of us, people of Estonia, are the people we absolutely never want to be ourselves.
Where to flee from our own selves?
Trump transcript leak likely a federal crime, former prosecutors say
Whoever leaked the transcripts of President Trump's phone calls with foreign leaders to the press likely committed a crime, former prosecutors said Thursday - as lawmakers called for rooting out the culprit.
"The unauthorized release of these documents to the press is a crime," Joe diGenova, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, told Fox News.
The series of acts involving release of notes of the president's conversations with foreign leaders, and these transcripts, are a serious threat to national security.
Based on the leaked documents, The Washington Post reported new details Thursday about Trump's tense phone calls in late January with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the former, Trump reportedly told the Mexican leader to stop publicly saying his government would not pay for a border wall.
The newspaper said the transcripts had notes indicating they had been classified by the chief of staff on the National Security Council.
The Post said it obtained full transcripts, which were "produced by White House staff" and based on records kept by White House note-takers.
"There is a federal statute that makes it a crime, a federal crime, to disseminate classified information to an unauthorized person," Doug Burns, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said in a phone interview.
While some details of those calls already had emerged in February, the release of the transcripts marks a much bigger blow to a White House trying to crack down on leaks.
The report incidentally was published as top figures in the Trump administration are preparing to go before the public on Friday in a show of force to demonstrate their commitment to rooting out leakers of classified information.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina are all expected to brief the public at Justice Department headquarters.
It's unclear whether the Post leak might be investigated by the DOJ.
To prosecute someone for this, Burns said there are "certain elements that obviously have to be shown."
He said "there can be dust-ups over that," citing the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails and the decision not to prosecute.
Those considerations include the markings and history of the document and its exact classification.
If classified, prosecutors would look to see if it was disseminated to an unauthorized person in a manner that negatively affects the interests of the United States.
"If all of those things can be proven, people can very definitely be in harm's way for criminal exposure," Burns said.
"No question."
Speaking of the transcripts of Trump's phone calls, diGenova, who prosecuted espionage cases, said these documents are "generally classified at secret and above."
Claiming the leaks imperil the ability of the U.S. government to conduct foreign policy, diGenova called on the attorney general to institute a federal criminal grand jury to find the leakers.
He also said the phone records of the reporters and editors of The Washington Post should be subpoenaed, something the journalists would surely protest.
On Capitol Hill, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said Thursday there should be criminal prosecution for leaking classified information.
"Whoever leaked these needs to be found out and needs to be reprimanded, needs to be fired," Lee told Fox News' "America's News HQ."
"This is unacceptable and should never happen."
Lee, who practiced law before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said such a leak "is a felony, a very serious federal felony offense."
"Doing something like this could not only and should not only result in termination but also criminal prosecution to the extent there's classified information involved," he said.
Friday's announcement at the Department of Justice may provide more of an overview of what the DOJ hopes to accomplish rather than specific prosecutions at this stage, Fox News is told.
Last week, the president, lashing out against in his attorney general in public, criticized Sessions for not doing enough to find the leakers.
"I want the attorney general to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies," Trump said in the Rose Garden on July 25.
Sessions himself, speaking to Fox News' Tucker Carlson last week, admitted he has not been satisfied with the efforts to investigate leaks, which have repeatedly hampered the president since his inauguration.
"I have not been happy with the past prosecutions and investigations of criminal leaks," Sessions said.
Even some critics of the president have spoken out against the leaks, saying such efforts harm foreign policy efforts.
"Leaking the transcript of a presidential call to a foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking, and dangerous," David Frum wrote in the Atlantic on Thursday.
"It is vitally important that a president be able to speak confidentially - and perhaps even more important that foreign leaders understand that they can reply in confidence."
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also told The Daily Beast the leak is "absolutely" troubling and should be investigated by Congress.
10 underhanded advertising tricks that make food look more appetizing
As many foods are hard to photograph, pictures sometimes use some other ingredient to fool people – for example, glue instead of milk or mashed potatoes instead of ice cream.
The Youtube channel Top Trending looks at what tricks are the most common in the advertising world.
If someone in a commercial opens a popcorn package or takes a hamburger out of a box, a bunch of attractive steam escapes from it.
In actuality, the shot is longer and the hot food doesn’t give off steam the whole time, as the steam comes from the high moisture content, which bread products for example don’t have.
For this reason, little cotton balls soaked in water have been added to the packaging or food, with the capability of absorbing and retaining its share of water.
When exposed directly to heat, they steam longer than a burger or popcorn and the product is made to look as if it was freshly prepared.
Mashed potatoes are a big help for photographers as they doesn’t start melting when exposed to heat or light and doesn’t change consistency significantly like many other foodstuffs.
For example, a creamy filling in a cake or ice-cold seeming ice cream may actually be mashed potatoes.
A little colour and decorative elements and the consumer is fooled.
Glue fills in for milk.
Milk is not easy to photograph either, because it doesn’t necessarily look so white on a photograph.
And foods served in milk quickly become mushy.
Since breakfast cereal or muesli has to look crisp and tasty in milk, glue is used instead – not a single flake will sink through it.
Restaurants often go to great lengths in preparing meat so that the result would be juicy and done to perfection, but not so in advertising.
Yet meat displayed in advertisements seems especially tempting, like if it’s just off the grill.
Often it is pre-fried on a pan or roasted in an oven and then stripes are painted on it in imitation of grill marks.
Working with whipped cream is just as complicated as with ice cream, because it tends to melt.
Luckily there’s a product that is nearly identical to whipped cream in appearance – shaving cream.
Thus it may actually be shaving cream that’s on top of the cake or berries or in the milkshake in the ad.
Even fruit sold in supermarkets may be coated with a thin layer of wax to make them look shinier.
For a photograph, it’s not enough, though, and so deodorant is sprayed on instead to add shine to the fruit.
Likewise, sauces aren’t that photogenic, because over time they become runny or they separate.
This is where wax comes to the rescue, as its bright colours and more stable texture make it possible to take an appetizing picture.
Wax is likely to be used on pictures that show molten chocolate flowing over cake or ice cream.
If you see an ideal slice of cake in a picture, with the ideal proportion of sponge cake to filling, probably some additional layers or pieces of cardboard have been used.
That’s because filling tends to spread out and ruin the picture when the cake is cut.
If pieces of cardboard are inserted into the cake after cutting and sprayed with filling, it leaves a visually more attractive impression.
Cardboard and safety pins are used inside the burger so that all ingredients are put in place so they would stay nicely in place.
That is a burger served at a restaurant never looks like it does in an ad.
Chicken stuffed with paper.
In an ad, a roast chicken looks juicy and plump, but it may not even be cooked through.
To leave the impression of plumpness, the chicken is stuffed with paper, and if necessary it is smoothed with the mashed potatoes beforehand and then sprayed all over with brown paint.
Pancakes are doused with maple syrups especially in Amercan ads, because that makes people hungry for pancakes.
Actually, pancakes absorb syrup and the flowing rivulets of syrup disappear quickly before the photographer can capture them.
That is why each pancake is sprayed with a cleaning product meant for sofa cushions, to avoid rapid absorption.
Often this is not enough and thus golden-brown engine oil is used, poured over hot pancakes and passed off as syrup.
Former soldier jailed for murdering OAP suspected of sex abuse
A former soldier has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years for murdering a man he believed had abused a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy, 70, was found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow in June of the murder of David Farish, 75, at his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire, in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers described the murder as "particularly brutal," with 14 stab wounds inflicted on the victim.
Defence lawyer Brian McConnachie QC said the killing was a "moment of madness" but he described the circumstances as "unique."
Cassidy had been told Mr Farish had sexually abused a woman over a long period.
His lawyer said he went to Mr Farish's home and "befriended" him in the hope of hearing a confession rather than planning to kill him.
Lord Summers said Cassidy showed premeditation on the day of the attack and referred to a social work report that found he had received Special Forces training while in the Army on how to infiltrate groups by befriending them.
No charges had been brought against Mr Farish.
The court heard that, after the murder, Cassidy contacted police and handed himself in.
Mr McConnachie said most people found it "hard to understand" that Cassidy would be capable of murder.
The defence lawyer said: "He had never been in trouble in his life before this incident.
He lived a fulfilling life until what he describes as a moment of madness in February 2016."
Cassidy is said to be in poor health and has suffered a heart attack and stroke while in custody.
Lord Summers said he took into account Cassidy's lack of previous convictions and what he had reportedly been told about Mr Farish as he passed a life sentence with a minimum term of 17 years in jail.
Police Scotland described the case as a "particularly heinous murder of a frail, elderly man in his own home."
Detective Inspector David Pinkney said: "Although this sentence will not reverse his cruel actions, I do hope it will bring some measure of resolution for David's family."
Monday was the last opportunity to suggest a name for a rhinoceros born in early June.
Zookeepers now have a big box full of names to look through to find the right one to announce at a ceremony taking place on the zoo’s anniversary, 25 August.
On the other hand, names can be submitted for young minks until Restoration of Independence Day.
Starting in early August, the entire rhino family can be seen walking together in the outdoor enclosures.
And although the sire Kigoma runs around butting fenceposts while snorting self-importantly, the dam Kibibi doesn’t let it get to her. The young rhino gets valuable lessons.
Although the peak of the birth season is past, a yak calf and two goats saw the light of day on 1 August.
On a warm summer day in Kullimäe, one might chance upon bathing eagles.
Takins – members of the goat family with an unusual appearance – are now in heat.
Thursday was the latest Vivacolor painting day at the zoo.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the elephant dams’ large outdoor enclosure’s fence posts and the elephant sire’s observation deck.
So that they would not disturb the painters, the elephant dams Fien and Draay again spent time in the company of Carl, the sire.
On 9 August, the zoo’s second “classic Wednesday”, the Aavo Otsa trumpet ensemble will perform.
Rhino and mink mugs and other splendid keepsakes are available as souvenirs from the zoo.
The proceeds of the charity sale will support a corresponding species protection project.
At the tiger day held last week, over 1,000 euros was raised through the charity sale.
Good to know: how to calculate the amount of sugar in dairy products?
“Under European Union food labelling standards, the amount of carbohydrates and sugars can be listed on the packaging, which is not however equal to the amount of ordinary white table sugar,” said Valio Estonia marketing director Krista Kalbin.
She said there are actually three types of sugars in dairy products: the lactose in milk – natural milk sugar – the glucose and fructose in fruit – and added sugar, sucrose.
If one remembers a few basic truths, Kalbin says, it shouldn’t be difficult to calculate the quantity of added sugar in a product.
First of all, find out whether it is a milk or fermented milk product.
Ordinary milk and milk-based beverages contain about 5 grams of natural lactose per 100 g of product.
In fermented milk products, part of the lactose has been used up by yoghurt or kefir bacteria as a result of which fermented milk products have an average of 3.5 g of lactose per 100 g of product.
“To calculate the quantity of added sugar, the first thing you have to do is subtract the lactose from the sugar quantity,” said Kalbin.
Now the fructose and glucose from berries and other fruit must be subtracted from the sugars.
“In general, flavoured dairy products contain about of 0.3 g of fructose and glucose in the case of the ordinary 3-4% fruit content and in the case of especially berry-rich products with approximately 15% fruit content, up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams,” said Kalbin.
She says the simple calculation shows that the percentage of added sugar in berry yoghurts may be only half of the quantity of sugar marked on the package.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation is a bit different as the sugar content depends on the production technology.
Comparison of lowest-priced spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna rituals
The consumer guide section of Postimees newspaper compared the most cost-effective packages offered by spas for one person for a single night’s stay on 11-12 August.
“Spa hotels come in different star classes and service selections; so it’s very hard to draw an unequivocal comparison based solely on price,” said OÜ Spa Tours sales director Mario Sau.
Comparing lodging establishments that offer spa options, it turns out that the prices of the cheapest packages vary severalfold and there are options for both more demanding customers and holidayers with more modest preferences.
For example, while a single room for a solo traveller at Värska Spa aquatic centre with buffet-style full board costs 51 euros, including unlimited use of the water park, weight room and saunas, visiting Pädaste Manor on Muhu Island will set one person back 287 euros.
That includes accommodation in a Double Deluxe category room, breakfast in the winter garden of the Alexander Restaurant and a half-day spa package called “Peel and moisturize”.
Selecting and comparing different packages, one should take into account that to get the cheapest price, one should go on holiday with a friend or companion, because staying in a double room is cheaper than a single.
If one desires to holiday alone, in this case, depending on the place, guests are offered special single rooms as well as double rooms with a single-occupancy supplement.
Whereas generally a solo traveller will have to pay an additional fee of a couple dozen euros for single occupancy in a double room, there are cheaper options if one is willing to compromise.
For example, a package including a single room for one night at Haapsalu’s Fra Mare Thalasso Spa costs 86 euros, but if desired, they also offer a lower-cost option of a double room on condition that if that there is limited space, someone else is accommodated in the same room as the customer, with advance notice.
In such a case, the price of the package is 58 euros.
To get a cheaper deal, it’s a good idea to be flexible.
The prices of the packages are dynamic, meaning that they depend on the weekday and vacancies.
“Prices can vary from 112 euros to 248 euros in the case of the cheapest package,” said Triinu Teras, sales and marketing director of the V Spa Hotel in Tartu, regarding their price policy.
She, too, drew attention to the fact that the prices vary at their hotels depending on occupancy and added that in general customers get the cheapest price if they book directly from their website or ask for an offer.
As the summer period is the busiest for spas, it is wise to make timely holiday plans to avoid a situation where the desired spot is sold out.
For example, on the selected package comparison date of 11 August, Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa and conference hotel had only suites and Lahemaa’s Vihula Manor was sold out.
One need not go far to find places for a relaxing holiday: nearly every larger town in Estonia has one or even several spas.
Before buying a package, one should check whether there aren’t any major events nearby, because prices go through the roof then.
For example, the White Lady Festival events take place in Haapsalu from 11-13 August.
During this time, many tourists are in Haapsalu, demand for lodging is high and we have major-event prices during this period.
“Thus we won’t be selling discounted or special offers on packages during this time,” commented the director of Laine, Irene Väli.
Chinese firm that came to Estonia last year immediately posts 100 million euro turnover
The Chinese-owned agricultural produce seller Agritera, which launched operations only last year, attained a turnover of nearly 100 million euros
Close to 2 million euros in profit was earned, Äripäev reports.
The company’s annual report shows that Agritera OÜ, engaged in purchasing and wholesaling agricultural produce, had sales revenue of 100.6 million euros in 2016.
1.91 million euros in profit was earned.
The company was not in business a year earlier.
The company employed an average of 3 people last year. It had no employees in 2015.
Turnover per employee was 33.6 million euros and the average gross pay was 316 euros per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest throughout the year so you don’t need a holiday
Naturally, I had only myself to blame for the fact that I didn’t vacation during this holiday period.
I suppose I was a somewhat necessary employee, but I also guess I was the only one who considered himself irreplaceable.
I myself was to blame for the foolish sense of duty that gripped my chest.
What’s great about the quotation in the headline of this column is that it’s completely true.
And so it was – the new job I started in March of this year has required its fair share of working, but something about the job was so much of a better fit for me that in just three months I recovered to a completely new life, feeling like I was totally rested.
It’s still summer now, a time for going on holiday.
It’s time to make a New Year’s resolution, to take stock of what has happened in life and what direction all this stuff is heading.
“Christmas and New Year’s are the time for that!” someone is bound to exclaim, crossly.
Well, no doubt it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not a good time to think about one’s life and set goals.
All right, I’m speaking only for myself here, but I certainly am not capable of making any change around New Year’s.
It’s too difficult a time for me.
Of course, there’s loads of joy and good cheer during Christmastime: I like knowing that the light is about to return, I like Christmas lights and Jesus himself has a totally congenial outlook, a revolutionary kind of guy.
Still, in spite of that, I generally find myself very weary and sometimes stressed out around Christmas – because that same darkness.
Yes, in leading a vacation-free life, I end up doing a good amount of work, perhaps more than I would in some damned slaughterhouse, and I constantly feel fairly rested.
Mostly, I end up like a hamster on a wheel in the time leading up to Christmas – presents, at least four Christmas parties, a slightly heavier workload…
Factor in the incessant social pressure to feel joy and peace in your heart under any circumstances, and the hardship of Christmas is pretty plain to see.
But a person who is weary and at their wit’s end isn’t capable of taking good decisions, to say nothing of improving on them in the form of a plan.
Such things have to be decided with a more or less clear head.
A person who’s tired will toss up empty but generous promises that are about as useful for laying the future’s foundation as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is meant to change something has to be thought through calmly; it should increase the benefits; it should be a plan.
Unlike a promise, a plan contains not just a goal but also a roadmap for action and doesn’t just break after a few tiny setbacks.
That’s why I say that the best time to come up with promises is right now, in the summer.
You just have to rest up calmly and deduce why you’re so tired (if you are).
If you don’t force yourself to bolt around during your vacation like a calf that’s got out of the pen, a couple weeks is enough to find in your life, some crooked part that needs to be bent straight, and to think about how exactly to go about doing that.
I consider it important to live, as much as possible, so that I don’t need a vacation, so that I rest up on a running basis, not once a year.
In this way, a holiday would be an extra pleasure, not a compartmentalized stop you need to survive, and during which you recharge just enough to somehow get through the next year.
I recommend that everyone make one simple summer resolution – if you have to get up tomorrow morning at a definite time, then skedaddle off to sleep in good time the night before.
I believe that if one in ten Postimees readers heeded my advice, life in Estonia would get markedly better.
I myself plan to follow my own advice.
We already have a four-day work week, but not the kind we want
Open office. Photograph: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Unbeknownst to them, many Estonians already have the four-day work week they crave.
Yet it’s not the kind they would want, reports Äripäev.
It is a product of modern office planning – in other words, an open office.
According to the prestigious management periodical Harvard Business Review, an employee in an office without walls spends close to 1.5 hours a day – almost an entire work day per week – doing nothing.
Yet while a four-day work week usually is taken to mean four days at work and three days off, this sort of forced solution is inferior to it.
Instead of being spent with family or on hobbies or recuperating, the 1.5 hours taken away from working time consists of problems concentrating, interruptions of work, increasing irritation and anxiety and problems, diminished motivation for working.
Strong winds are in the forecast for the third day of the Weekend Festival.
Indeed, the Õhtuleht photographer’s lens caught a seagull in distress, who was trying to defy the wind and take flight.
Due to the windy weather, many festivalgoers have said that sand is getting in their mouth and eyes.
How one man built a $51m theme park for his daughter
A father from Texas realised there were no theme parks where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one.
Gordon Hartman had just got out of the swimming pool on a family holiday, when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan went up to some children playing in the water.
She tried to make friends with them but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they shied away from her because they didn't know how to react to someone with a disability - Morgan has the cognitive understanding of a five-year-old as well as a form of autism.
The incident played on his mind.
"Morgan is just a wonderful young lady.
When you meet her you will always get a smile and she will always want to offer a hug.
But there were so many times we couldn't take her places," he says.
Hartman and his wife Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere she would feel comfortable, and others would feel comfortable interacting with her.
"We realised such an inclusive place didn't exist," says Hartman.
So in 2007 he decided to build it himself.
A former property developer, he sold his homebuilding businesses in 2005 to set up The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a non-profit organisation that seeks to help people with disabilities.
Then he set about creating the "world's first ultra-accessible theme park."
"We wanted a theme park where everyone could do everything, where people with and without special needs could play," Hartman says.
He brought together doctors, therapists, parents and other people with and without disabilities to consult on the facilities.
These were built on the 25-acre site of a disused quarry in San Antonio, Texas.
The park, called Morgan's Wonderland, cost $34m (£26m) and opened in 2010.
Attractions include a fully-accessible Ferris wheel, adventure playground and miniature train.
Visitors regularly tell Hartman it is the first time they've been able to experience such attractions.
There is also a carousel with specially designed chariots for wheelchairs that go up and down alongside the animals.
However, Hartman reveals Morgan was at first wary of the ride.
"When we opened she was too scared to go on it.
She didn't understand why it was going around and the animals were going up and down," Hartman says.
It was three years before Morgan would go on the carousel.
"First she would stand near it, then she'd get on an animal but we wouldn't start it.
It was a slow process but now she loves going on it.
Overcoming something she was scared of meant a lot to her.
Little things achieved in play can make a big difference."
Since it opened Morgan's Wonderland has received over a million visitors from 67 countries and from all 50 American states.
A third of staff have disabilities and entrance is free to any guest with a condition.
"I realised Morgan was one of the lucky ones because she had many of the things she needed.
I didn't want cost to be a barrier for others with special needs," Hartman says.
"We open every year knowing we're going to lose over $1m (£750,000) and we need to recover that through fundraising and partners."
This year, the theme park was expanded with the opening of Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully-accessible water park.
"Fewer people were visiting in July because the wheelchairs got too hot.
So we decided to create a water park next door," Hartman says.
Parts of the island use warm water, which helps visitors with muscular problems.
Waterproof motorised wheelchairs are provided, which run on compressed air rather than batteries.
There is also an accessible river boat ride.
Altogether, the water park cost $17m (£13m).
"Yesterday a man came up to me at Inspiration Island and just held my hand," Hartman says.
"He pointed to his son, who has acute special needs and started crying.
He said he hadn't been able to play in water before."
Hartman says three out of four visitors to the park are not disabled, and that the park is having precisely the effect he hoped for.
"It helps people realise that though we are different in some ways, actually we are all the same," he says.
"I saw one girl in a wheelchair go up to another girl without special needs, and they began playing together.
That was really cool."
Hartman isn't planning to open any more parks, despite receiving hundreds of letters and emails from people who want one in their own area.
Instead he is focusing on providing educational facilities to teenagers with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are a lot of different organisations trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere and we'll continue to work with them," he adds.
He continues to take Morgan along to play at the theme park, where she is now something of a celebrity.
"When she comes here she's a rock star!
Lots of people want to talk to her and take her picture, she's very good with it," Hartman says.
Now 23, Morgan continues to go from strength to strength.
"She talks more now and most of her physical issues have been taken care of through numerous surgeries.
We're so proud of how far she has come."
When Morgan visits she's happiest playing on the swings and in the sand zone, unaware of just how much she has helped others.
"Morgan knows the park is named after her, but I don't think she understands the magnitude of what it represents and how it's changed lives," Hartman says.
"She doesn't realise how she has dealt with things in life has made her a true inspiration."
U18 team head coach Vaido Rego: a playoff game can be decided by one or two baskets
Estonia’s under 18 age category basketball team defeated Poland 68-63 in the European championships division B quarterfinal. The head coach said it was a old-school playoff meeting.
It wasn’t a pretty game.
Both teams had done their homework, and the points didn’t come easily.
The issue of who had the better nerves came into play.
A playoff game can indeed come down to one or two baskets,” Rego mused.
While it was a victory, the first thing a coach looks for is what can be improved.
One can always find something to grumble about.
We committed some bad fouls, our opponent got easy free throws and lived off of them.
That’s happened before for us – when you start defending aggressively there’s the danger of trying too hard.
We’ll draw our conclusions,” said Rego.
He used nine players today. Robin Kivi, who missed a couple games due to injury, was still on the bench
These decisions are made on a running basis.
Kivi participated in the morning practice and pregame warm-up, but he wasn’t hundred percent ready,” Explained the coach.
Tomorrow at 1815 Estonia will meet Great Britain in the semifinal, who beat Bulgaria today, 76 to 73.
The winner of this game will play in division A of the European championships in the U18 age class next summer.
Video: Vassiljev misses high on direct free kick for second time for new club
On its home field, Piast found itself trailing Wroclaw Slask from the ninth minute, but managed to tie the game 20 minutes later.
Vassiljev had a great opportunity to clinch the first win of the season for Piast.
Four minutes before the end of regulation time, the midfielder missed on a free kick.
The match ended in a 1-1 draw.
In four games, Piast has garnered two points and is second to last in the league standings – 15th.
How to keep sex exciting when you’re trying to have children?
It’s thus very important to keep the passion burning even when you’re trying to bring a new life into the world.
Female First gives some tips on what course to take so that sex doesn’t seem like a bothersome duty.
Don’t see it as a responsibility.
This can happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it can take years to get pregnant.
Sex on demand takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel that they can’t enjoy “ordinary” sex at the end of their cycle if they know there won’t be a positive outcome.
This causes strain in the relationship, which may lead to less sex and less sex of course means an even greater probability of not getting pregnant.
Men on the other hand feel that they have to be able to “perform” on demand.
If you know your fertile days in advance, this can support you in planning something romantic with your sweetheart.
It might be a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy one another!
Take the fertile period into account.
From the reproductive standpoint, there’s no point in having sex if ovulation has already occurred, but to get your relationship to blossom, try to have sex just for pleasure on the non-fertile days.
Although there’s no evidence that pregnancy is more certain if the woman has an orgasm, still, don’t forget that!
Keep in mind that every couple is different.
Everyone manages the stress of making a baby differently.
Some men want to know about their partner’s cycle, others prefer not to know, so that they wouldn’t feel pressure to perform.
No one knows better than you what is right for you.
Find your own solution!
Studies have shown that couples who have sex every couple days have the best chance of success, but not every couple can maintain that frequency.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that is best for you as a couple.
IAAF warns cheats will face tough scrutiny at World Championships in London
The IAAF World Championships begin in London on Friday with athletics in the spotlight as rarely before over doping scandals.
These championships will be the first watched over by new body, the Athletics Integrity Unit, which will also monitor corruption, gambling and the faking of results.
"You can't guarantee that human behaviour is such that that won't happen.
So what we can do is say we're going to have best practice, best anti-doping programme you could possibly have at the moment based on information and intelligence gathering and we'll see the outcome following the event," said the AIU's David Howman.
The AIU has allowed 19 of around 190 Russian athletes caught drugs cheating to take part, competing with neutral status.
Watch on demand: Levadia routs Paide city team at home
Levadia has put itself in a difficult position, as in the last round, they were upset playing away by Viljandi Tulevik (Future) and standings leader Flora took advantage of the opportunity, increasing its lead to seven points.
Coming from behind, Nõmme Kalju has drawn even with Levadia.
Paide, which made some roster moves in summer, now senses a keen lack of captain and midfield maestro Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, they have plucked only two points for draws, and they are eighth in the league standings – four points behind Tartu Tammeka and four points ahead of Tulevik.
Paide lost 7-0 to Levadia in their first meeting and 5-2 in the second.
“My watch died, but I didn’t,” actor Raivo E. Tamm quipped with a broad grin at the finish of Ironman 70.3.
True, for the entire full-length triathlon, the smile tended not to quit Raivo’s face.
Moreover, while running 21.1 km, he even got caught up in conversation: “I was chatting with a guy while running, someone passed me and was amazed: “Jesus, you have the energy to talk!”
Raivo, who had energy for conversation, did switch to speedwalking a few times.
At his coach’s suggestion.
“Ain-Alar Juhanson said that it was OK to walk uphill and there was no point in forcing yourself to run, because there are some ascents and in terms of time there’s no difference whether you run or speed-walk,” said the actor, who noted he had taken his coach’s advice to heart.
He was also able to catch his breath during the walking parts and perhaps that is why he was able to give interviews left and right without panting after crossing the finish line.
As if he hadn’t just swum 1.9 km, cycled 90 km and run 21.1 km.
“I think my physical form was such that I could enjoy the race,” Raivo, who started training in January and has so far lost 16 kg, admits with a chuckle.
And as for the interviews, that was my desire, that I would have the energy to give interviews after the finish.
I have been able to do interviews after every race, and I hoped that it would be great to be able to do so after Otepää Ironman.
I thought that it would be good if I weren’t collapsed in a heap after the Ironman.” On quite the contrary to lying in a heap, Raivo presented quite a different picture upon crossing the finish line: hands outstretched skyward and a sincere triumph shining on his face.
There was good reason: It took 46 minutes ad 24 seconds for Raivo to swim 1.9 km, 3 hours and 32 minutes to cycle 90 km, and 2hours and 18 minutes to run 21.1 km.
“My heart now belongs to the triathlon,” Raivo says, who shouted already at the finish that he has married his fortunes to running.
I have already registered myself for the 20 August Gran Fondo – 230 km from Tallinn to Tartu on bike!
So it’s off to training again tomorrow!
Marty Sklar, Longtime Disney Aide and Executive, Dies at 83
Mr. Sklar, who died on July 27 at his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, maintained his connection to the company after his retirement in 2009 (timed for the 54th anniversary of Disneyland's opening).
Last year, at Day 1 of Shanghai Disney in China, he became the only cast member, as the company calls its workers, to have attended the openings of all 12 Disney parks worldwide.
And less than two weeks before he died, he was at D23, a Disney fan convention, reminiscing on a panel about Disneyland.
His death was announced by the Disney company, which did not give a cause.
He was 83.
Mr. Sklar's job editing The Disneyland News was a temporary one, but he returned to Disneyland after graduating from U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its publicity department.
He soon became Mr. Disney's chief ghostwriter for publicity materials, dedications, souvenir guides, speeches, slogans, presentations and short films, like the one that helped the company win approval to build Walt Disney World and Epcot in central Florida.
He also collaborated with Walt and his brother, Roy, on Disney's annual reports.
"It was pretty heady stuff for someone just closing in on his 30th birthday and only six or seven years out of college," Mr. Sklar wrote in his autobiography, "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
But even as Mr. Disney leaned on Mr. Sklar's writing, he assigned him to work on the Ford Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, where the Disney company was designing exhibits and attractions.
Mr. Sklar wrote Mr. Disney's narration for the "Magic Skyway" at the Ford pavilion, with its animatronic dinosaurs and cave men, and was the main link to major corporate sponsors.
It was the start of Mr. Sklar's second phase at the company.
As an increasingly important member, and leader, of the Imagineers, he became even more identified with the legacy of Mr. Disney, who died in late 1966, well before the openings of Walt Disney World, in 1971, and Epcot, in 1982.
After Mr. Disney's death of lung cancer at 65, Mr. Sklar was thrust back into writing when he was told that the company's top executives had not prepared a public statement in advance, even though, as he wrote in his autobiography, "it was no secret Walt was dying."
Mr. Sklar resented having to write the statement that Roy Disney would sign, he said, but he understood that the lack of planning was a sign that Mr. Disney's death had paralyzed the company's leaders.
"The truth is they were all scared as hell," Mr. Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in New Brunswick, N.J., on Feb.
His father, Leon, was a teacher, and his mother, the former Lilyn Fuchs, worked at Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach, Calif., when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had temporary jobs working at Douglas Aircraft, scooping ice cream at a hamburger drive-in and delivering packages for the Postal Service.
But in May 1955, as his junior year at U.C.L.A. was ending, Mr. Sklar received a message to call E. Cardon Walker, the head of marketing and publicity at Disney.
At the time, Mr. Sklar was the new editor in chief of The Daily Bruin, the U.C.L.A. student newspaper.
Mr. Walker asked him to interview for the job of creating and editing The Disneyland News.
The theme park was opening soon, Mr. Walker told him.
It needed him.
Mr. Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
But Mr. Sklar still needed to assure Mr. Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I was on the job two weeks and had to present the concept for the paper to Walt Disney," he recalled in a podcast for the Disney Avenue website.
"If Walt didn't like it, I was out the door, and he'd get a pro to do it.
But the good fortune was that Walt liked it.
I was 21.
It was scary.
I'd never worked professionally."
Mr. Sklar eventually distilled Mr. Disney's lessons (and some from others) into "Mickey's Ten Commandments," a manifesto of theme park management.
Among the commandments: Know your audience.
Wear your guests' shoes, figuratively speaking, to experience an attraction as they would.
Tell one story at a time in any given attraction.
Bob Rogers, an expert in themed entertainment, once called Mr. Sklar "the sorcerer's apprentice" - the role Mickey Mouse played in the Disney classic "Fantasia" (1940) - for channeling the Disney philosophies to three generations of designers.
Mr. Sklar is survived by his wife, the former Leah Gerber; his daughter Leslie Sklar; his son Howard; and four grandchildren.
Mr. Sklar was a devout Disney executive.
He routinely wore a three-faced Mickey Mouse watch (which gave him the times in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a gold Mickey Mouse ring.
And he never forgot all that Mr. Disney had taught him.
When the Disney company was developing a children's area for the California Adventure Park, Mr. Sklar reminded the planners to include activities that parents and children could do together, as Mr. Disney would have mandated.
"I reminded everyone that the reason Disneyland existed at all was because Walt used to take his daughters Diane and Sharon to the Griffith Park merry-go-round," he told The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on the park bench eating peanuts and popcorn while the kids rode alone."
Police takes over 200 people down to the station during Weekend Festival.
In total, over 20 crimes were reported in the city of Pärnu during the days of the festival.
About half of them can be linked to the music festival, besides violent crime, a large number of drug possession charges and two drunk driving charges were registered.
About a hundred of the misdemeanour proceedings opened were related to juvenile use or possession of alcohol or banned substances.
A couple thefts and disturbing the peace charges were also recorded.
Law enforcement took over 200 people to the station for various reasons.
Of them, about 50 were juveniles and the predominant reason for a trip to the station was drunkenness.
Last year there were 50% more juveniles taken to the station.
About 50 people – as many as last year – were taken to sober up.
Pärnu police precinct head Andres Sinimeri said the above figures were as expected considering the large crowd.
As in years past, we made thorough preparations for the weekend this year.
We involved additional forces from other prefectures, police cadets and assistant policemen to ensure readiness to respond rapidly.
Most situations were resolved verbally and communication between law enforcement and the citizens was enough.
“Some wrongdoing probably ended up being prevented, because the police presence was quite visible and palpable in the city, in our opinion,” said Sinimeri.
In his opinion, it was extremely positive that there were so many fewer juveniles who had visibly used alcohol and the young people proved that one could party even while sober.
He praised the security company’s top-calibre team, who took care of security in the festival area.
I thank all of the festivalgoers who behaved in a respectable manner and celebrated in a safe way.
“I also thank local residents who with their understanding attitudes contributed to making a major festival a success,” the police chief said.
Lost articles found over the weekend in the city and festival grounds await their owners at Pärnu police precinct.
The head of the Pärnu service responsible for return of lost and found objects, Annika Pärna, said there were fewer items in the lost & found than last year.
Over half of the items were returned to their owners on a running basis in the police tent on the festival grounds.
The items most frequently lost over the three days were bank cards, identity documents, cell phones and keys.
“There are another 13 cell phones, three wallets, a laptop, a smart watch and several sets of car keys still awaiting their owners at the station,” said Pärna.
101-year-old man skydives
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military decoration to commemorate his skydive, which broke a world record.
At the age of 101 years and 38 days, the man performed a feat that made him the world’s oldest person to perform a parachute jump.
Business group urges cabinet to agree on Brexit transition
One of the UK's biggest business lobby groups has urged the cabinet to stop "dancing around the edges" of Brexit.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) called on the cabinet to come up with a "transitional agreement" to smooth the move to Brexit.
It wants it to bridge the "the Brexit Gap" between leaving the EU and setting up new trading arrangements.
It warned that without agreement, business faces "short-term chaotic cliff edges."
The group criticised the cabinet for engaging in what it called "a range of speculative arguments over transition."
In recent weeks cabinet members have given opposing views on how long a transition period would last and what it would involve.
The IoD report Bridging the Brexit Gap: Options for Transition said: "Instead of dancing around the edges, this issue must become a policy discussion for the cabinet.
This could minimise the growing level of confusion and uncertainty in this area."
However, Gerard Lyons, an economist and leading figure in the Economists for Brexit group this week described concern about a "cliff-edge" Brexit as "alarmist talk" similar to the fear of the Y2K bug threat to computers at the turn of the millennium.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond warned in June: "There is a large amount of business investment that is being postponed until business can see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is."
Allie Renison, IoD head of EU and Trade Policy, said: "The Chancellor is right to worry about business investment stalling.
This is among the most frequently considered changes to deal with Brexit, alongside relocation of operations to the EU.
The latter is especially true for IoD members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering co-location or relocation."
The IoD suggests a range of options including: Doing a deal to extend the Article 50 deal beyond March 2019
Joining the European Economic Area
Agreeing to stay longer under the rule of of EU law
Creating a transitional customs agreement, similar to the EU Customs Union
Ms Renison said: "The IoD has put forward this range of options for transition in the hopes that it sparks a proper debate on the practicalities of how best to Brexit.
Prioritising interim arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of EU exit means the eventual opportunities aren't diminished by short-term chaotic cliff edges."
Russian railway looking into possibility of launching St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin passenger train
A Russian railway is looking into the possibility of launching a St. Petersburg-Berlin train line that would go via Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Railway director Viktor Golomolzin told Interfax Severo-Zapad.
Passenger traffic monitoring shows that from the economic standpoint, it is barely possible to restore Kaliningrad-Berlin train service.
And we are offering another route – Berlin-Kaliningrad-St. Petersburg.
The technical possibilities for this exist in regard to both infrastructure and rolling stock,” said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that there already exist Russian trains that can switch rail gauge and continue travel on the European track gauge.
Golomolzin believes this path is promising, as currently inhabitants of St. Petersburg and all of northwest part of Russia have to go through Moscow and Brest when travelling to Germany.
A route through Latvia is being discussed as a possible variant, Latvian Railways (Latvijas Dzelsceļš) press representative Māris Ozols confirmed to Latvian Delfi, saying that there is currently no concrete decision but that the variant is under discussion.
Latvian Railways and its partners, including Russian Railways, is looking for a possibility to increase competitiveness in servicing passenger flows, so that railway transport could compete with road transport.
Pakistani Hindus fail to find asylum in India
Seventy years after the biggest migration in history precipitated by the partition of the two countries, Hindus are still moving from Pakistan to India.
In shabby camps located on the border between two countries, tens of thousands of people are there before them, people who don’t even have a legal right to work in India.
Thus many have no other choice but to toil away illegally in stone quarries near temporary dwellings – the Indian authorities keep a close eye on the movements of those who have come from the other side of the border.
Most of the arrivals from Pakistan would never have expected such a reception.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
There we worked in the fields, we were farm folk.
Here people like us are forced to split stone in order to earn a living,” said Jogdas, 81.
For us, Partition isn’t over.
Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they don’t have anything,” added an elderly man living in a field camp near the city of Jodhpur.
After India gained independence from the British Empire in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
The partition led to a wave of violence that lasted months, in which at least 1 million people lost their lives due to religious strife.
Amidst the bloody chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled recently established Pakistan; Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite the emigration, Hindus are still one of the most numerous minority groups in Pakistan.
According to various estimates they make up about 1.6% of the country’s 200-million-strong population.
Many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear robbery, rape, and forced marriage.
“The persecution started soon after partition,” said Jogdas, whose family moved to what is now Pakistan a couple months before Partition, due to drought.
There hasn’t been a single day where we’ve been able to live in peace.
I wanted to come back to live among my Hindu brothers.
The nationalist government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to make it easier for those persecuted on religious grounds to find asylum in India.
Last year the government made it possible for immigrants to apply for citizenship in their place of residence; previously the whole process has gone through the central government.
Hindus who resettle from Pakistan to India get the opportunity for expedited citizenship after they’ve lived in the country for seven years.
Due to bureaucratic delays, the process often takes significantly more time.
64-year-old Khanaramji left Pakistan in 1997 and received Indian citizenship in 2005.
But he says many have given up and gone back to Pakistan because they see that there’s no good life waiting for them in India.
The government offers no support.
We’re like lost sheep.
We just try to stay alive on our own,” says Khanaramji.
But even worse than poverty is the scepticism from the authorities.
People who lack citizenship have to endure oppression from intelligence agencies.
They are constantly treated like suspects and Pakistani agents,” he explained.
Singh Sodhal, who started a charity organization in Jodhpur devoted to assisting Hindus from Pakistan, had great expectations in Modi when he came to power in 2014, but has grown disillusioned.
Tensions between India and Pakistan have grown during the Modi administration and migrants bear the brunt.
“Their life is becoming a hell,” said Sodhal.
For many, however, this kind of treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and his two adult sons fled to India two years ago as he had started receiving death threats from his Pakistani neighbours.
“To save our lives we had to flee to India,” said Horoji, 65, whose grandparents where originally from what is now India but found themselves on the wrong side of the border when the country split up.
My grandfather moved to the other side for work reasons.
But he told us to move to India when the time was right because he had a sense the future could prove dangerous for Hindus.
I think it’s gone pretty well for us.
We’ve managed our work and our activities well,” says Pärnu police chief Andres Sinimeri as to how the first two days of Weekend have gone for them.
Sinimeri says that today as well, patrols and first responders are on the streets and talking to people – in other words people have questions and want to know how one becomes a first responder.
Over these two days, the police have had to deal with some brawls and a few drug-related incidents.
“There was also some cases of possession of large quantities of narcotic substances, but we will draw our conclusions once Weekend is over,” says Sinimeri.
Over two days, about a hundred people have been down to the Pärnu police station.
Luckily, the police have not had to solve any extreme incidents.
Incidentally, Sinimeri says that if the skies open up and the rain comes down in sheets, they won’t have much to do.
One Haapsalu police field chief has once said that rain is like having an extra patrol unit.
Pärnu police have set up a staff in the Weekend grounds, with a lost and found and a place to claim lost articles.
Incidentally, the police themselves lost an important gizmo, which good citizens took to the lost and found.

Multi-Emmy-nominated writer and producer Neal Baer has shelled out $4.35 million for a Hollywood Hills West home rooted in the atomic age.
The Midcentury Modern-style home was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and named the Wohlstetter House for original owners and nuclear arms strategists Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter.
Set down a gated driveway, the 2,754-square-foot house has wide sliding glass doors that open to gardens, terraces and courtyards.
The living-dining room has cork floors, a fireplace and movable panels that open to the kitchen.
Three bedrooms and three baths make up the main house.
Also on the property is a detached guest house that overlooks a giant Koi pond and sleeping porch.
The separate structure includes a bath and extra storage.
Albert Wohlstetter was an influential nuclear strategist during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlstetter's analysis of the intelligence failures before the attack on Pearl Harbor was cited by the Sept. 11 Commission.
The Wohlstetters served as advisors to both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile crisis.
They received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work on the television dramas "ER" and "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."
Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane of Deasy/Penner and Partners were the listing agents.
Hattie Ramirez of Keller Williams Realty represented the buyer.
Plane traces perfect outline of itself over the US
A pilot has taken a passenger jet on a zigzag cross-country flight over the US - and even managed to have some fun with the route.
Live flight path data from the aircraft showed that its flightpath was more than just one straight line or arc, rather it was a series of flightpaths connected to resemble a plane.
Flight BOE004 departed from Boeing Field airport in Seattle at around 3.40pm local time Wednesday, according to Flightradar 24, which tracks air traffic in real time.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took a path east across Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before changing course dramatically and flying south-west.
When looked at on a map, the jet's bizarre route depicts the shape of a twin engine passenger jet.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of an 18-hour "endurance" test of the aircraft.
"Rather than fly in random patterns, the test team got creative, flying a route that outlined a 787-8 in the skies over 22 states," a Boeing Company spokesperson told RT.com.
"The nose of the Dreamliner is pointing at the Puget Sound region, home to Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
The wings stretch from northern Michigan near the Canadian border to southern Texas.
The tail touches Huntsville, Alabama," he added.
Boeing's long-haul 787-8 Dreamliner was first launched in 2009.
The aircraft has a maximum capacity of 242 passengers and a range of more than 13,600 kilometers.
While the pilot used radar as a personal canvas, the flight stirred up intense interest among planespotters online.
Some people speculated it was a test flight, while others suggested it could be some kind of odd coincidence.
Estonian children’s clothing styles influenced by cartoons
While in Europe and America, children’s fashions are often influenced by what the children of the royal families or celebrities are wearing, Estonian parents choose clothes for their offspring based on what is happening on the cinema screen.
The young British Prince George is becoming a true fashion guru, on the example of his mother Duchess Catherine.
Like his mother, the prince with his clothes is capable of unleashing a real shopping frenzy, which even has a term of its own – the Prince George effect.
The last occasion was a few weeks ago on the royal family’s visit to Poland, where George wore a 10-euro blue and red striped dress shirt by the Spanish brand Tizzas. Parents caught up by the craze emptied out the brand’s online store in just 24 hours.
There probably weren’t all that many shoppers from Estonia among them, as our parents are allegedly completely nonplussed by the royal family’s children’s duds.
Kaubamaja department store head of communications Anna Ansmitt says that the children of the star couples and foreign fashion trends generally don’t influence our parents’ purchases.
In Estonia, the biggest trendsetters are films, cartoons and also Youtube channels.
And this the most popular products in recent years have been fidget spinners, games with characters from the animated film Frozen, dolls, clothing, dancing dogs or cats, hatching penguins and so on.”
Yet she also says that if desired, it’s also possible in Estonia to dress their kids similarly to European princes or princesses.
Centre Party doesn’t want Savisaar election coalition
The regional heads of the Centre Party from all over Estonia issued an appeal to the public and fellow party members calling them to vote for the Centre Party, not election coalitions.
Above all, the message was meant for those considering whether to vote for the Savisaar election coalition or the Centre Party.
How Princess Diana used her make-up as a weapon
When I think about Princess Diana's make-up, the first thing that comes to mind is the eyeliner.
To begin with, the girlish blue of her youth.
Later, the heavy black kohl of her Martin Bashir Panorama interview, deployed to devastating effect as she gazed up through thick lashes and uttered the immortal line: "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."
Her eyes, huge and moist and outlined heavily in black against her gaunt, pale face, gave her the appearance of a wounded animal.
It was exactly the effect she wanted to achieve.
In private, though, Princess Diana never wore much make-up: not by modern standards anyway.
It wasn't just that she didn't need to - she was a genuine beauty - it was also that she saw it as a bit of a chore; work-related rather than a source of pleasure.
In public, she could be thickly painted.
She once arrived at the offices of Conde Nast, publishers of Vogue, wearing a heavy layer of almost orange foundation.
She apologised, saying that if she didn't make sure her skin had the requisite sun-kissed glow and went out looking "normal," the paparazzi would take pictures and everyone would accuse her of looking "pale," "wan" and "exhausted."
It was for this reason Diana had thrice-weekly sunbed sessions, on a machine she kept at home.
Today, of course, such behaviour would be frowned upon for health reasons, but for Diana they served a useful purpose - allowing her to present a sunny disposition to the world even when on the inside all was dark clouds and thunder.
Perhaps one of the biggest mistakes the Royal Family ever made was in thinking that, by approving her as a wife for Charles, they were getting themselves a pretty little brood mare with nothing but fluff for brains.
The exact opposite was true.
She may not have been top of the class at school, but when it came to image management, she was an A-star pupil.
To Diana, hair and make-up were important insofar as they could be used to communicate a mood or a feeling.
Otherwise, she had not the slightest bit of interest.
Her friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was godmother to her youngest child - remembers that make-up was not something they ever talked about.
"What I do remember," she says, "is how relieved she was on the times we went on holiday together that she didn't have to put it on."
Now, we tend to think of make-up as a way of enhancing a woman's looks, but if you look back across the arc of Diana's life, it's clear she used it as a powerful PR tool.
Those moments when she was most at ease, most herself, are the ones where she is also at her most natural, wearing hardly any make-up at all.
Careering down Loggers Leap at Thorpe Park in 1993 with her two young sons, she is drenched to the skin and laughing like a drain, her mascara pooling underneath her eyes like any other mother on a day out with the kids.
Four months since her separation from Charles was announced, at last she looks defiantly carefree and "normal."
Or zipping out of the gym in those later years, hair slicked back, toned legs encased in cycling shorts, face flushed from her workout, health and vitality oozing from every pore.
Towards the end of her life, when she was beginning to assert her independence and as her confidence grew, we saw more and more of this Diana.
She became involved with the Halo Trust, famously walking through a minefield in Angola in January 1997.
Then 35, her hair soft and natural, her face almost entirely free of make-up, she had arguably never looked more beautiful, or more reminiscent of the bright, hopeful young girl smiling out of her engagement photo 15 years earlier.
Diana was just coming into her prime.
In the early days there was a dreamy, Pre-Raphaelite quality to the young Diana Spencer.
But it wasn't long before the "princessification" began - a process largely orchestrated by the Press and Palace to turn Diana into a sophisticated young lady worthy of her new status.
In part, this involved the handiwork of Clayton Howard, the veteran make-up artist Lord Snowdon often used for photoshoots.
Howard first met a nervous Diana at Snowdon's Kensington townhouse for the Vogue magazine shoot that would produce the official engagement picture.
At this point, in late 1980, Diana was a blank canvas.
Her most sophisticated beauty products came from The Body Shop - Elderflower Under Eye Gel, for example.
Howard used Max Factor Sheer Genius foundation in Honey Touch and a Max Factor blusher stick in Frosted Coral.
On the eyelids, he applied Elizabeth Arden shades Rice and Timberland, with a white frosted eyeshadow on the brow.
Navy Elizabeth Arden mascara and that blue eyeliner, also Arden, completed the look.
And we know all this because Howard created a bespoke face chart for her.
"Diana's eyes are so spectacular in colour that I wanted to emphasise their striking blueness," he later wrote.
The finished result is not flattering to such a young girl: she looks 18 going on 50.
Her brows are too heavy, and her eyes overworked in dull brown.
Most striking, though, is the infamous eyeliner - worn on the waterline, inside the eye - in that ghastly Disney Princess blue.
A fantasy shade for a fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana looks back at us a little unsure.
One of the sources of Diana's anguish was that she never knew where her public persona stopped and her private self began.
This was the start of it.
The person who perhaps had the most influence on Diana's look was Mary Greenwell, still very much a part of the modern make-up scene.
Now an ambassador for, among others, Chanel, she remains one of the icons of the make-up world.
"Diana had the most amazing, beautiful skin and long limbs," she remembers today.
"She was simply gorgeous.
Men adored her.
She was sexy without meaning to be."
Mary first met Diana in 1991, when she was asked by Anna Harvey - then head stylist at Vogue - to do her make-up for a shoot with Patrick Demarchelier, one of the magazine's most celebrated photographers, for the December issue.
Hairdresser Sam McKnight was also part of the team.
This was at the height of Diana and Charles's marriage woes and the beginning of the skirmish for public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone very famous," says Greenwell.
"When we arrived, Diana was just standing there looking gorgeous, sweet and friendly, and so excited to be on the cover of Vogue."
The resulting cover - Diana in a simple black sweater, chin resting on her hands, her blue eyes bright, elegant French polish on her nails, hair cropped short - was a game-changer.
It radiated positivity, individuality and flair.
It was, above all, modern - encapsulating the neat, pared-back aesthetic of the early Nineties and placing Diana in stark contrast to the Royal Family, which was about to embark on what the Queen would later call her "annus horribilis."
"Diana was very relaxed about her make-up.
She really just wanted to look fresh and new," says Greenwell.
Over time she taught Diana to do her own make-up - moisturiser, foundation, concealer to lift the eyes, mascara - and emphasised a healthy skincare regime, encouraging her to take good care of herself and adopt a "beauty from within" mantra.
Diana "did everything in moderation," says Greenwell.
She got plenty of sleep and cut back on alcohol, essential for fresh-looking skin.
The Princess favoured Guerlain foundation, Clarins lipsticks and Wild Rose blusher by Clinique.
But the biggest favour Mary did for Diana was to wean her off blue eyeliner.
"It was just so very ageing for her," she says.
Instead, she used a combination of soft browns and neutral tones, with a brown pencil along the lash line, blended so that all the edges were beautifully softened.
Often she just used a tinted moisturiser and a little bit of bronzer to emphasise Diana's healthy glow.
"Diana used to ring me and ask me to go over to discuss products with her, which I loved to do," Greenwell tells me.
"I think she found it relaxing; her chance to have a few moments to herself."
Luxury brand Clarins was a favourite.
Diana was said to have used their Sensitive Skin day and night creams and their Alpine Herbs cleanser and toner.
She also had regular facials at the Central London salon of beauty therapist Janet Filderman.
Diana had famously lovely skin, but sometimes suffered from rosacea, a mild cheek rash that is often stress-related.
To calm it, she used a combination of natural soothing oils, including rose-hip.
"The thing about Diana," says Greenwell, "is that she had the most wonderful bone structure."
The only part of her appearance she was not wholly confident about was her nose.
As Anna Harvey recalls: "Once, when the papers were saying she'd had her nose done, she turned to me and said laughingly: 'Honestly, if I'd had my nose done, do you think I would have chosen this one?' "
As the advice from Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight took hold, Diana began to grow more confident in her new look.
One of her most memorable appearances - at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1994 wearing the famous "revenge dress," a daring off-the-shoulder, figure-hugging number by Christina Stambolian - shows her starting to crystallise what was to become her signature style in the final years of her life.
Hair short and swept back, up and over the ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her no-nonsense crop a sharp contrast to the very daring black silk dress.
Her make-up is perfect: flattering yet understated, the blue of her eyes emphasised by the black on her waterline.
Never one to shy from bright colours - particularly reds - she wears the high gloss scarlet nail polish, almost certainly Revlon Red, that now becomes a kind of trademark.
A few months later, she flashed her elegant red manicure launching the Child Bereavement Trust at the Royal College of Nursing.
The Princess is the picture of health and self-confidence.
She is also completely and finally in control.
Tanned and toned, her make-up flawless, she projects exactly what she wants the viewer to think: here is a woman who, at last, seems to have both a sense of self and purpose in life, and who, having just turned 36, is at last coming into her own.
It's just a shame that she never got to prove herself right.
Southwest Japan braces for Typhoon Noru
A wide swathe of southwest Japan, including areas devastated by torrential rains last month, on Friday braced for more rain as Typhoon Noru, at one point the world's strongest storm this year, churned closer to the country's main islands.
The Amami island chain, located just south of the southwest main island of Kyushu and some 1,350 km (840 miles) from Tokyo, will be hit by high winds and heavy rains from noon on Friday, with as much as 800 mm (31 inches) possible in the next 48 hours, the Meteorological Agency said.
Noru - which is a Korean word for a type of deer - is then likely to turn north and drench Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which last month were hit with torrential rains and flooding that killed 36 and left four missing, are likely to be spared the worst, an agency spokesman said.
"This is an extremely slow-moving storm," he added, noting this means there is a higher danger of floods due to extended heavy rains in one area.
Noru, at one point a Category 5 typhoon and an unusually long-lived storm, first formed two weeks ago and wandered in a circle around the northern Pacific before heading northwest and aiming for Japan, weakening as it approached.
Depending on how its course changes, Noru could also rake straight across Kyushu and then along Japan's main island of Honshu, but longer-term movements are still hard to pin down, the spokesman added.
There is some terrain that ordinary vehicles just can’t access, no matter how you try.
An ATV is the solution.
Kaitse Kodu! provided an overview of the ATVs in use in the military sector.
Use of such lightweight vehicles with good terrain coverage is nothing new in military structures.
The need for them first emerged during World War II, and serious interest began to be taken in them a decade later.
Simplicity and power
Back in 1956, the M-274, which would be nicknamed the mechanical mule, rolled out of the Willys Overland plants – it was the next generation of a vehicle constructed in the closing years of WWII and meant for evacuating the wounded.
It is a bit odd to call the mechanical mule a next-generation vehicle.
It is hard to imagine a more spartan vehicle.
A platform with wheels, seat and a steering wheel: that’s it, end of story.
It is as if overzealous builders grabbed the blueprints from the engineer’s desk too hastily and started production.
Yet in war, off-roading ability counts a great deal more than comfort.
In this regard, there was no match for the mule when it was put to the test in the jungles of Vietnam.
The lightweight machine, weighing less than 500 kg, managed to effortlessly drive in places where even the Willys Jeep, which had garnered mythological fame for its ruggedness, had to concede, flashing its brake lights.
The vehicles with close to 500 kg carrying capacity were mainly used for transport – both munitions and personnel.
Sometimes lighter recoilless anti-tank weapons were mounted on the mule’s back.
If such a vehicle came under fire, and it did happen, the driver could pivot the steering system forward, so low that the vehicle could be operated lying on his stomach.
The mules were produced until 1970, a total of 11,240 were produced and they were in use by the Army until 1980, when they were replaced by the HMWVs that now reigned supreme.
In the subsequent two decades, ATVs had more of a marginal importance in military circles.
They re-emerged after the Twin Towers crumbled in New York and US soldiers found themselves in a shooting war on the desert terrain of Iraq and Afghanistan.
It was there that the knowledge and realization came about that something was needed to fill the gap between Humvee and infantryman.
As ATVs generally didn’t provide significant protection, they are not the best choice for direct combat duty.
But fast and light vehicles are good for special missions.
For example, reconnaissance or rescue operations.
Currently thousands of ATVs and UTVs are in use by the American military.
Most of them – like the XUV55s purchased for the Estonian Defence League – are similar to the ones in civil commerce, but modified to meet the army’s needs.
Trademarks now wearing the camouflage colours include such names as Kawasaki Mule, Honda Rancher and Foreman, Yamaha Rhino and Arctic Cat and the ever-wider selection of models from the leading military ATV manufacturer Polaris.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year contract with US SOCOM special forces centre for supply of two-seater MRZR2 and MRZR4s and a separate five-year contract for one-seater MV850s based on the Polaris Sportsman, which has infrared and black-out lights and innovative honeycomb tyres that ensure the vehicle remains operable after a hit from a 50-celibre weapon.
Before the MV850 came to market, Polaris managed to supply MV700 and MV800 vehicles to the military.
The MV700 is a militarized version of the civilian-use Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, with the addition of winches in front and back, a two-part fuel tank for covering longer distances, a reinforced frame and undercarriage and some military equipment that farmers and hobbyists on forest roads didn’t have much use for.
Just like the John Deere M-Gators used successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside the Polaris ATVs, it is equipped with weapons rests, a luggage rack on the hood and a number of other elements that are useless on the ranch but necessary in a combat zone.
The 750 kg vehicle is capable of carrying nearly its own weight in equipment – 570 kilograms of gear.
The engine capacity is enough to pull lighter trailers and artillery pieces.
The modifiable shape compartment in the back, the sides of which can be removed, allows baggage to be transported from point A to point B that is even bigger than the small but tenacious bug.
Later, enhanced versions of the M-Gator were also completed: the A1, which is 20 hp more powerful than the original 20 hp M-Gator, and the ensuing reinforced-frame A2, which is even better for transporting and towing weight, and the A3, which combines the positive qualities of the A1 and A2.
Actually, the M-Gators had their baptism of fire in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, when medicine brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they reduced the load on soldiers traveling on their own foot power, transporting their gear that they would otherwise have had to tote on their back.
Where as most ATVs used in military structures are modifications of civilian-use vehicles, there are some exceptions.
The most outstanding of these are the warhorses called Prowler, made by Phoenix International, which have seen successful use in all sorts of combat, recon and rescue missions around the world.
The manufacturer claims these vehicles, which were first introduced and used for special operations, overcome the bottlenecks typical of ATVs in conventional use and also of the ones that have been modified for the army, in terms of handling, ruggedness and safety.
Being similar to an ordinary ATV in terms of build and size, the Prowler is nevertheless completely different in construction and capability.
It is faster, more durable, more stable, and is able to pull and carry more weight than other vehicles of the same type.
For example, in the case of an ordinary ATV, the driver has to constantly shift their body’s position to maintain vehicle balance and use both arms to manoeuvre, accelerate and decelerate, but operating a Prowler is more like driving a car.
Yet at the end of the day there’s no difference whether it’s a Prowler, Gator, MV850 or some other ATV or UTV – the concept and area of use is similar for all of them.
And it’s clear that in conditions where defence spending cuts are generally sought and smaller-scale operations aimed at a specified target is favoured over broad-based conventional warfare, light and agile small vehicles have joined the army in order to stay in service.
Sensitive details of vulnerable children in care released in department bungle
The personal details of children in care, including whether they were sexually active, was accidentally sent to the mother of one of the children in a troubling information breach.
A spreadsheet was emailed to the mother outlining the name, birthdate, location, and specific concerns and alerts relating to all children in the care of a large service provider in a regional Victorian city.
The email revealed where each child was staying.
A 13-year-old boy is listed as being on bail and displaying sexualised behaviours, a 15-year-old girl who has issues with self-harm, substance abuse, and absconding is "out with the boyfriend" and "will not be returning tonight," and a 14-year-old boy is noted as needing help with "self-care" and being verbally abusive and physically threatening.
The spreadsheet appears to be a handover document which was meant to have been sent to an overnight supervisor.
It contains notes about when some children are expected home, or whether they are likely to contact staff to be picked up.
There are concerning levels of detail about some children.
"If staff contact to request permission to conduct a room search or laptop/USB search, given concerns in regards to inappropriate sexual material, permission to be granted," the alert for a 15-year-old boy reads.
The document also shows that a 17-year-old girl who is only three months from turning 18 and being released from residential care was considered to be such a high risk of attempting suicide that staff had to call triple zero immediately if she absconded.
A 16-year-old boy on parole is listed as out, and that he will "contact staff to be picked up later on tonight."
While the locations listed only mention the name of the housing unit where the children are being held, and not the address of the unit, there is enough detail for it to be found.
Details of the 2015 breach emerged as the mother shared with Fairfax Media her experiences of dealing with the Department of Health and Human Services and child protection services since her daughter was taken into care four years ago.
She agreed to share her concerns now that her daughter has turned 18 and left the system.
The heart-wrenching decision to turn her daughter over to child protection came after a violent incident at home, one of a growing number of family violence complaints being made by parents against their children.
It had troubling consequences the mother could have never imagined, such as her daughter racking up seven criminal charges within six months of leaving home, being moved hundreds of kilometres away, to a home and situation she appeared to thrive in, but then being moved back again without her parents being told, and the acceptance and facilitation by her daughter's carers of two relationships her daughter had with older men.
The first of these boyfriends, a 17-year-old who her then 15-year-old daughter had regularly been allowed by care agencies to stay with in a local hotel, ended when he was charged within days of his 18th birthday with child sex offences because of the relationship.
"Why was she left worse off than when she went in?" the mother said.
"And is this what happens to every child in care?"
She is a particularly strong advocate for the establishment of a facility which allows DHHS to monitor children for the first few weeks of them being taken into care, before they are moved into residential homes.
This would allow them to better understand how they interact with others, their risks and their needs, particularly in relation to education.
The state government is looking at new ways to divert children away from residential care, including by better supporting their parents.
Targeted care packages, funded with $62 million over four years, aim to help transition children from residential care to better arrangements.
And a $5.6 million, two-year trial announced last October will provide professional foster carers to at least 28 children, helping them to transition from or avoid entering care.
A department spokesman said the information breach was not formally reported at the time, although the mother claims she told two department employees within months of it occurring.
The department is now working with the service provider to address the incident.
"Any claim of a privacy breach is taken very seriously ... we will work to ensure there has been no negative impact on the young people involved."
In July last year, Minister for Families and Children, Jenny Mikakos, commissioned an independent review of a sample of child protection privacy incidents over a five-year period.
The department accepted its seven recommendations, and has since updated the child protection manual to ensure staff are clear about their roles and procedures in relation to privacy, changed IT systems to remove the automatic population of some personal details, and formally reviewed the department's privacy functions.
Australia's Commonwealth Bank Accused of Massive Money-Laundering Breaches
The Australian government on Thursday accused the country's biggest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, of widespread breaches of money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.
Financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC said it had initiated civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against CommBank for "serious and systemic non-compliance," in the biggest case of its kind in Australia and the first against a major bank.
"The effect of CommBank's conduct in this matter has exposed the Australian community to serious and ongoing financial crime," AUSTRAC said in a court filing.
Commonwealth Bank said in a statement it was reviewing the allegations and would respond "in due course."
Australia's biggest mortgage lender failed to report suspicious matters "either on time or at all involving transactions totalling over AUS $77 million ($61 million)," AUSTRAC said.
The agency alleged 53,700 contraventions of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act, particularly with regards to so-called intelligent deposit machines or IDMs.
The previous biggest such case came against Australia's top bookmaker Tabcorp Holdings, earlier this year, with only 108 alleged breaches.
Tabcorp paid A$45 million in fines, the biggest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.
An AUSTRAC spokeswoman declined to comment on possible penalties facing CommBank, or whether other banks could be in the agency's firing line.
The maximum penalty for contravening the anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing law is AUS $18 million per breach.
IDMs are a type of automated teller machine that accepts deposits by both cash and check, and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.
There had been significant growth in the use of CommBank's IDMs since their rollout in May 2012, AUSTRAC said.
Cash deposits in the six months to June 2016 surged to AUS $5.8 billion compared with AUS $89 million in the first six months after CommBank introduced the machines.
Cash was deposited using fake names with proceeds going to drug importation syndicates, AUSTRAC alleges in its court filings.
"Even after suspected money laundering or structuring on Commbank accounts had been brought to CommBank's attention, CommBank did not monitor its customers with a view to mitigating and managing money laundering/terrorism financing risk," the court filing shows.
CommBank accounts were also used for "cuckoo smurfing," a form of money laundering that involves transfers between countries without the need for money to actually cross international borders, AUSTRAC added.
United Nordea and DNB bank to become reality at end of year
The merger of DNB and Nordea Baltic units into a financial group called Luminor will become a reality in the last quarter of the year, Äripäev reports.
Opening its doors as a single legal corporation has been postponed several times.
After publication of merger plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction might fall into the second quarter.
In April, however, DNB’s head of communications said it would be postponed to the third quarter.
Namely, the Swedish Financial Supervision Authority gave Luminor additional instructions to be fulfilled, given the reginal importance of the united bank.
Trump Called New Hampshire a "Drug-Infested Den," Drawing the Ire of Its Politicians
"The president is wrong," said Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican.
It's disappointing his mischaracterization of this epidemic ignores the great things this state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, called his remarks "disgusting" and said on Twitter that her state was no different from any other that was battling widespread opioid abuse.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, also a Democrat, agreed.
"It's absolutely unacceptable for the President to be talking about NH in this way," she wrote on Twitter.
A gross misrepresentation of NH & the epidemic.
Addiction to opioids - a category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the most lethal drug epidemic in American history.
Drug overdoses killed more people in 2016 than guns or car accidents - an estimated 59,000 people, according to data analyzed by The New York Times - and are now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.
More than 97 million people in the United States took prescription painkillers in 2015, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
An estimated 12 million of those did so in ways that were not sanctioned by a doctor, it said.
New Hampshire has been hit hard, and residents repeatedly raised the issue with presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
There were an estimated 470 drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire in 2016, compared with 439 in 2015.
In 2012, there were 163, according to statistics compiled by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.
On Thursday, Mr. Sununu described the opioid epidemic in an email as "one of the worst health crises this state has ever experienced."
He said the government had doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery efforts.
He said it had also spent millions of dollars on prevention programs for children, law enforcement to end drug trafficking and initiatives to expand the availability of naloxone, which is used to treat drug overdoses.
Bid to trace drivers after girl raped twice in Witton
Police want to trace the drivers of two cars as part of an investigation into the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
The teenager was attacked in the Witton area of Birmingham at about 02:00 BST on 26 July.
Prior to that attack, she was raped at Witton station.
A man has been charged in connection with the first incident.
British Transport Police would like to speak to two drivers as part of their investigation.
Police said the first car is a light coloured saloon-type vehicle.
Det Chf Insp Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We believe the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim outside the station, prior to her being picked up by another person who then raped her in a car.
We'd like to know what was said during the conversation, and it may be that the driver can provide us with some vital details which will help our inquiries."
The driver of the second vehicle, described as a red VW Sharan, is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was raped a second time, police said.

Why not keep your leg muscles toned!
You’re Gorgeous has some tips for nine exercises that should help you attain slimmer and trimmer legs.
They claim you should see the first changes already after the first week of training!
Although the weekend is here, your appetite for being busy hasn’t gone away.
Your hands and feet are still itching to work, you’re trying to encourage others to get busy, too.
You could forget your worries and go off on a getaway with your better half.
Take some time for yourself to enjoy each other’s company in some cosy, romantic place.
Talking on some exciting subject, you get fired up, make big plans, perhaps make promises…which you forget about a moment later.
The other party remembers what you said, though.
No doubt your demeanour is restless, it’s hard to focus on any activity.
Your mood doesn’t necessarily depend on what is happening now but on things that happened earlier.
When you find yourself in a complicated situation, you are able to act in a rapid and rational manner.
It’s possible that you will help someone out of a jam, because you have enough smarts and stick-to-it-ness.
Instead, forget worrying about money and business matters.
Take time to rest and relax.
Going to crowded events can be tiring and strain your nerves.
It’s possible you might accidentally find yourself in a situation that escalates into a serious dispute in the course of which you have to assertively defend your position.
If others cross a line, don’t you do it.
You feel better in the environment you are accustomed to, doing things you know how to do and which make you happy.
You probably don’t thirst after new knowledge and adventures.
Having fun is something that will probably never completely satiate you.
Today as well, something is calling you to socialize.
What happens at the party may not be conventional.
It may happen that despite your day off you may have to resolve work-related problems.
Or although you are physically at home, in your mind you’re still at your desk at work.
If you want thrills, travel can offer them.
The whirlpool of adventure will suck you in, you will have to get yourself together to stay on the crest and maintain your balance.
Don’t waste energy arguing about money matters.
Take up the topic only if the situation really requires rapid and decisive intervention.
Why do dogs nibble on grass?
Sometimes it’s believed that dogs eat grass when they don’t feel well and want to make themselves throw up.
Actually, most dogs that eat grass are totally healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs who eat grass do so because of some illness.
One reason that a dog might suddenly start eating grass could be a nutrient-poor diet.
Dogs with worms also may have a greater interest in chomping on grass.
Thus, if a dog who hasn’t chewed on grass before suddenly starts doing so frequently, it would be a good idea to get it checked by a veterinarian to quickly diagnose any possible problems with digestive organs.
It should be mentioned that dogs may also eat grass because they like the taste or out of boredom.
If a health problem is ruled out, one should make sure that the family pet has enough fulfilling and fun activities in its life.
Thunderclouds are approaching Estonia from the west.
Thunder has already been heard in northern Estonia and scattered flashes of lightning seen.
This afternoon, the weather service issued a thunderstorm warning.
Today there will be thunderstorms mainly in various places in northern Estonia.
Thunderstorms are moving rapidly from west to east.
“Gust of southwest wind will be up to 15 m/s inland, and up to 18 m/s on the islands and coast, but stronger gusts are possible during thunderstorms,” the weather service website says.
A much bigger thunderstorm is raging in southeast Finland and east of St. Petersburg in Russia.
Luckily, winds in Estonia are from the west and southwest so there is no threat at least for now that the bigger storms will head to Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone to guest star in 'This Is Us' Season 2
Sylvester Stallone is going to visit NBC's hit drama in its upcoming second season, executive producer Dan Fogelman announced Thursday during a panel for the series at the Television Critics Association press tour.
The actor is going to guest as Kevin's (Justin Hartley) co-star in the movie he's filming at the start of the season.
"Kevin is shooting a big movie and we needed a big co-star," Fogelman said.
At the end of last season, Kevin scored a big acting job in a film directed by Ron Howard, who had a cameo in the show.
This season will see the character in production on the project and also working to rebuild his relationship with his ex, played by actress Alexandra Breckenridge.
Fogelman said Stallone plays the "father figure in the film that Kevin is shooting."
"This Is Us" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in series flashbacks, coincidentally played Stallone's son in 2006's "Rocky Balboa."
Fogelman said Ventimiglia's continued friendship with Stallone likely helped the show score the big-name guest star.
"We have a great script for him.
I think it's going to be really, really exciting," Fogelman said.
"This Is Us" returns September 26.
In the US, two employees from elite universities were arrested after a nationwide manhunt.
Forty-two-year-old Northwestern professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to police in California after the police had been looking for him.
Fifty-six-year-old Oxford University Andrew Warren was apprehended by police in San Francisco, on the other hand.
The men are suspected of brutally stabbing 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
He was found dead in Lathem’s apartment in Chicago late last month.
A couple days later, the suspects made a large cash donation to a library in the deceased’s name.
Before turning himself in, according to a Chicago police worker, Lathem sent a video to friends and family members in which he talks about making his biggest mistake.
CNN has not seen the video and police are not releasing it.
The police said it was a brutal murder and his body was disfigured from the wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from Great Britain, but investigators have not yet determined whether he knew the victim or how he knew them.
Before being arrested, both suspects fled the state.
Elise Christie on how she overcame Sochi nightmare and cyber bullying to skate for gold again
At 26, Christie appears unrecognisable from the fragile young woman who recently contemplated walking away from the ice rink for good.
The vicious abuse had cut her to the quick, doubly so because she had been bullied as a child at her school in West Lothian.
Today, she exudes a confidence that the ordeal can yet come full circle with at least one gold in Pyeongchang.
"I definitely want to come away as an Olympic champion," she says, unafraid of specifying a target.
"Physically and psychologically, I feel in the right state to be able to do it."
Once, she had entertained visions of a career as a figure-skater, until the aesthetic elements began to turn her off.
"I was really good at jumping, but I struggled with the arty side of it," she says, laughing.
"I wasn't so good at being elegant, tidy.
It was a sensible choice, because my personality is much more suited to short track."
Woman walking around the globe: my daily budget is $5!
Truth be told, I myself have had such an experience; true, only 40 days, back when I decided to live the life of a vagabond in southern France, to just be free and live one day at a time.
I would sleep in a tent in the forest in small-town train stations etc.
The second week, I joined a “homeless” French person, a 44-year-old man.
Oh, don’t think that there were any homosexual tendencies or anything: We just spent the nights in the same park in Menton and became friends; even though he was 15 years older than I, he was a good companion.
It turned out that the man was from a good family, from Paris, a former French naval officer.
He didn’t use alcohol, didn’t commit mischief, in a word he was a decent person, intelligent, good to talk to, had seen a lot of this life.
In short, we paired up in for the next three weeks and wandered around together from town to town, also for about €5 a day for food.
And enough money would come in, enough to live off of.
He talked me how to offer my services on the terraces of hotels and restaurants about to close in the evening and on farms along our way.
We did exactly enough work to get food money for the next two or three days.
At some point I developed a fever and I decided that I couldn’t keep on going…
I got a flight to Helsinki and from there I returned home…
And, incidentally, I still regret it.
Those 40 days were probably the best of my life…
A man who stole three amplifiers from a mosque was burned alive in Indonesia, Hungarian news agency MTI reports.
The 30-year-old thief sneaked out of the mosque in the city of Bekasi near the capital Jakarta with the amplifiers on 1 August, but the security guard at the mosque saw him and shouted: “Stop the thief!”
Help came and the thief began to be pursued.
The thief fled on motorbike and even swam across a river.
The chase lasted a few kilometres, then a stone thrown by one of the pursuers hit the man in the head, seriously injuring him.
The enraged mob of pursuers caught the thief and beat him.
One of the pursuers poured petrol over the thief and set him alight.
The man who was set on fire died at the scene.
His body was taken to East Jakarta police hospital.
The police impounded the deceased’s motorbike and the stolen amplifiers.
The local press initially published reports that it had not been a thief but an electrician who wanted to take the amplifiers to be repaired.
The police decisively countered these claims.
The relatives of the man who was burned to death said they would not file charges.
The German news agency dpa said the reason for this step is that Indonesians do not have particular trust in the police or judicial bodies.
Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim country.
Of the 255 million inhabitants, Muslims account for 87.2%.
Australian cuisine: from finger limes to the schoolyard.
Contemporary Australian cuisine inherited the finger lime and kangaroo meat from the aboriginal peoples.
The British roots have also had a great influence on the diet – for example, Vegemite, the dark brown, salty brewer’s yeast spread that is smeared on bread or crackers along with butter is reminiscent of the British Marmite.
Meat pies, too – pastries in a flaky pastry crust served with boiled potatoes and gravy – also come from the British.
Also of UK origin are BBQ Snags, which are sausages that Australians grill, while Britons tend to roast them in the oven instead.
A local star on the sweet scene is Pavlova, a meringue cake, although New Zealanders also claim it as their invention.
Crispy Anzac biscuits with coconut flakes and oats are also a beloved sweet, as are lamington cakes, squares of cake covered in chocolate and coconut flakes.
Honey Joys is the name for balls of honey and corn flakes.

This autumn, Stephanie celebrates her 77th birthday.
Her father was a public servant and her mother Mary loved food.
Stephanie studied library science in school and as is customary for young Australians, after finishing her studies she went off to discover Europe.
Travelling in France only reinforced and developed her love for food.
In London, she met her first husband, Monty, who had Jamaican roots, and when they returned to Australia, they opened a basic eatery in Melbourne in 1964, the Jamaican House.
Some ten years later, the marriage fell apart and the restaurant closed.
In 1976, she opened a slightly more upscale restaurant, Stephanie’s, which was one of the most celebrated dining establishments in Melbourne for the next 21 years.
The seminal restaurant is still remembered as the first fine dining establishment in Melbourne, which genuinely knew how to enhance the value fresh ingredients and served seasonal food – a fact that now seems like a basic axiom but was far from standard at the end of the 20th century.
After leaving the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, of which she has authored 15.
Estonia has more prolific food writers, but in her case, none of her books is just a collection of recipes.
For Australia’s home cooks, the various cookbooks by Stephanie Alexander are indispensable.
She herself considers her fifth cookbook, the extremely popular The Cook’s Companion, to be her life’s work; it is now in at least half a million Australian homes.
The book was first published in 1996, and an updated edition was published in 2004. The newest version is from 2014.
The 2004 edition takes up quite a bit of space on my bookshelf, as the imposing book has about 1,000 recipes on 1,126 pages!
The newest version is even more voluminous.

It’s a true culinary bible, which besides recipes also covers shopping and preservation of various ingredients, introduces food preparation technologies and provides recommendations for purchasing kitchen accessories.
The ingredients are listed in alphabetical order, and there are many cross-references – it’s clear that her librarian’s training was not wasted.
Stephanie herself emphasizes that it was this book that changed her life and gave direction to her future activities.
The feeling she got from the book’s popularity – that she had something to give people – led her to the next, kitchen garden project, which in Estonian conditions are comparable to school gardens.
A fourth person from Estonia received a heart transplant in Finland.
According to heart surgeon Günter Taal and cardiologist Pentti Põder, North Estonia Medical Centre doctors who took part in the operation with Finnish medics, the postoperative period has gone as expected.
“It is very hard to say how long the patient would have lived without a new heart,” said Põder.
The doctors said people have now lived for a maximum of eight years with a heart pump.
The patient himself is only recovering and is not ready to talk about the subject.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago and the disease had already reached the end stage. The heart failure was caused by ischaemic heart disease.
“For this patient, a transplant was the only option,” added Taal.
The heart surgeon said that after the transplant, the batteries or duct that are part of the heart pump are no longer attached to the patient.
He will only have a scar and anti-rejection drugs.
The patient can play sports and generally live like an ordinary person,” he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
Põder added that it would be three to six months until a full recovery.
Both doctors said the patient would have to follow a strict drug regimen, and the drugs have side effects.
In addition, the patient has to undergo examinations to avoid rejection of the donor organ.
The first year is the most dangerous, but according to ISHLT, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, already 50% of patients are living more than ten years.
Taal said the results in Helsinki are better and the longest anyone has lived with a transplanted heart is 25 years.
The cardiac surgeon explained that since the patient’s circulation was poor because of the disease, he was fitted with a heart pump a year ago, which helped him grow stronger for the operation.
When the man’s pulmonary arterial pressure fell, he became a suitable candidate for a transplant.
The transplantation operation is not considered a very complicated surgery, Taal said: the right timing is very important.
“It took much more time to get the pump and then the heart, than placing the new heart in position,” he said.
The heart surgeon also noted that a complicated part of the operation was coming off external circulation.
He said, a heart transplant can be considered somewhat be considered extraordinary, as Estonians need it the least.
Kidney, liver and lung transplants are performed significantly more often.
There is an element of uncertainty in this rarely encountered operation, but we have been practising this work for many years.
Getting to know yourself and your nervous system is an art that is part of the profession,” Taal added.
Four more people need an organ.
Taal said the heart for the patient was obtained because it wasn’t suitable for any other patient living in countries that are members of the Scandiatransplant association.
Scandiatransplant is an organ exchange organization whose members are Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are currently four more people on the heart transplant list in Estonia.
“They are only a handful of patients,” Põder stressed.
Men with a large build and blood type O positive wait the longest, said Taal.
“In Finland, there is about a half year wait for this,” he said.
There are also a number of conditions for getting a heart.
“Usually a woman’s heart is not suitable, nor is a large person’s heart suitable for a small person, and so on,” said the cardio surgeon.
How to finance company vehicles?
The changes in the consumer society have resulted in expanded possibilities for financing company vehicles – besides ordinary leasing, more and more companies are using full-service leasing or long-term car rentals, which imposes fewer obligations.
Leasing and car hire are two clearly different financial transactions, which involve different sorts of obligations and expectations but which often cause confusion.
The Estonian sale and marketing director of international car rental company AVIS Villi Tõld said companies were visibly moving toward full-service leasing and increasingly using the option of long-term car hire.
Tõld cited the main questions that can be answered to choose the suitable means of using a vehicle.
How long to use the car?
The biggest difference between renting and leasing a car is the term of use.
“It is wise to prefer leasing for longer use of a vehicle if the company plans to make use of the company vehicles for a longer term,” explained Tõld, adding that it would be wise to opt for ordinary leasing if the desire is to own the car, while full-service leasing or long-term car hire if one wishes to use the vehicle as a service – i.e. using the car every day but leaving the maintenance obligations to the service provider and giving up title to the car.
“A rental car has a significantly shorter period of use than a leasing period, but many major car rental firms also offer long-term car hire, as renting a car is free of complicated contracts and the car can be returned at any time,” said Tõld in detailing the different possibilities of renting a car.
Who becomes the car owner?
Upon the end of an ordinary leasing contract, the lessee becomes the car owner.
“In the case of full-service leasing, it is possible at the end of the leasing period to continue the lease payment on the same or better conditions, getting in its place an equivalent new vehicle that meets the company’s needs,” he said, emphasizing that as consumer society is moving increasingly toward service-centred consumption, ownership of a vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, full-service leasing comes with the option of buying the car on agreed-upon conditions, if this is desired.
There is no such possibility when renting and only the period of use is paid for.
Leasing a car generally takes place at dealerships and auto rent takes place in the rental office of a car rental firm.
Dealerships do primarily sell cars, but they also offer leasing and, in some cases, car rental.
Rental companies, however, have the exclusive objective of hiring out cars.
Tõld said that the reasons for using rental service are different – many companies hire company cars; in addition, it is convenient to use the service on business strips or while on holiday or if one’s own car is in the shop.
“In the case of company cars, there an increasing changeover to full-service leasing, which gibes the customer transparency of costs, savings on time in the car buying, use and return process, and more convenience,” said the sales and marketing director regarding the growing leasing trend.
Each year, more and more companies are using full-service leasing for their fleet of cars, thus optimizing their spending and focusing on their main activity.
What is the service-based insurance coverage like?
While in the case of a leased car, comprehensive and TPL motor insurance are obligatory, rental cars usually are covered by basic insurance with the additional decision to be made of opting for accident insurance, theft or comprehensive insurance. “If we compare ordinary leasing with full-service leasing, the customer gets a more for an equivalent monthly payment, as in addition to the vehicle and insurances, the monthly payment also covers regular maintenance, 24h breakdown assistance, tyre changes and other agreed services,” explained Tõld.
“While any vehicle can be chosen for an ordinary lease, in the case of full-service leasing, the service provider helps choose a car that meets the company’s needs and wishes, taking into account the usage functionality as well,” he said in comparison, stressing that full-service leasing will definitely help to optimize the spending related to the company’s motor fleet.
“The selection of rental cars however depends on the service provider’s car hire fleet – different rental companies’ fleets offer both small and economical vehicles for city traffic and luxurious ones for business meetings,” described Tõld.
During a busy rental period, of course, it may happen that the desired car is rented out, but making an early booking helps counter this.
When choosing between leasing or renting, first one should get clear on one’s goals – how long a time one wishes to use the vehicle for, and what are the long-term plans in connection with the car.
Certainly, it would be wise to familiarize oneself with the different conditions and obligations of the services.
At yesterday’s press conference, MP Olga Ivanova, who has joined Edgar Savisaar’s election coalition, said that the Savisaar coalition will give the Centre Party healthy competition in Tallinn at the autumn elections.
But how likely does Edgar Savisaar consider cooperation with the Urmas Sõõrumaa election coalition Tegus Tallinn (“Industrious Tallinn”)?
US Navy veteran ordered to remove American flag wrap from mailbox
A mailbox covered with the American flag is at the center of a dispute brewing between a retired U.S. veteran and a homeowners association in Florida.
Retired U.S. Navy Officer John Ackert says he received a letter last week from the Southwood Residential Community Associate in Tallahassee that asked him to remove the wrapping of Old Glory around the mailbox or face penalties.
He told WCTV he's not backing down without a fight and has made an appeal.
"I view this as a form of bullying to be honest," Ackert said.
And I think people should stand up to bullying of any form, and particularly this.
Ackert said the H.O.A claimed his mailbox was not "in consonance" with the aesthetic values of Southwood.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said he's been ordered to take down the American flag wrap covering his mailbox.
"As the holiday season comes to a close, please remove the American flag mailbox wrap," the letter read.
Decoration may be displayed 30 days prior and must be taken down 15 days after.
He said the wrap has been up for four years.
It was put there 30 days after I moved into this house.
Messages to the Southwood Residential Community Association were not immediately returned Thursday morning.
Some of Ackert's neighbors told WCTV the letter was a bit harsh and said they were not entirely surprised by the H.O.A's actions.
"They do things like this all the time," Mike Stephenson said.
I think it's ridiculous.
What's wrong with being patriotic in the country you live in?
Mike Patel said: "The man's a veteran, he served the country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think it's right.
He owns the house, he can at least have that.
The H.O.A. letter says Ackert has 15 days to remove the wrap or face a fine.
He has not received a response to his appeal.
Vietnam 'Regrets' Germany's Kidnapping Accusation
Vietnam said Thursday that it regretted comments by the German Foreign Ministry accusing Vietnamese intelligence services of kidnapping a former Vietnamese oil executive who's wanted back home on embezzlement charges.
German authorities believe Trinh Xuan Thanh was snatched in Berlin and gave the Vietnamese intelligence attache 48 hours on Wednesday to leave the country.
Thanh faces embezzlement charges, which carry the death penalty.
He had sought asylum in Germany but his application had not been processed yet while Vietnamese authorities sought his extradition.
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters that the comments were "very regrettable" and that Thanh turned himself in to police in Vietnam on July 31.
"Vietnam always attaches importance to and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany," she said, without elaborating.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after he was initially accused of mismanagement at a subsidiary of national oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, resulting in losses of some $150 million.
Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, police opened an investigation into embezzlement over his alleged involvement in a property development project.
Thanh was chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior government positions, including vice chairman of Hau Giang province in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was dismissed from the Communist-dominated legislature before its first session the following month.
He was also stripped of his Communist Party membership.
Vietnam's ambassador to Germany was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and was told that Germany demanded that Thanh be returned so that the asylum and extradition proceedings could be conducted properly.
Bus driver rescues eight puppies by side of the road, not knowing that the dogs actually had an owner.
“Where am I going t put these eight puppies, my wife would have kicked me out of the flat along with the dogs,” quips Oleg, the bus driver who saved puppies who were running around near a road unsupervised, delivering them to a shelter staffer.
The owner of the dogs soon appeared at the pound, baffled as to why the puppies were taken away from his yard.
Harju County bus driver Oleg said has had been working as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but had never had such an incident during his career. “I drove bus no. 146 on my ordinary route.
Near Harju-Risti, I saw something small running around by the side of the road.
I thought it was a raccoon-dog, but it turned out it was four puppies,” recalled the driver.
Oleg’s heart melted and stopped the bus, which was full of passengers, to collect the pups.
“I felt sorry for them, the cars would have hit them and crushed them,” said Oleg.
He added that the passengers were understanding and the puppies caused quite a happy stir aboard the bus.
The puppies were a bit shy at first, then became frisky.
Puppies on board, the bus driver drove the route a second time, as the he had stick to the schedule.
Driving past the place where he had found the puppies, he saw four more puppies in the same location.
These were German shepherd puppies.
Their fur was so fine and they were clearly well cared for.
They were beautiful dogs, astonishingly so.
My first thought was, of course, that someone was trying to get rid of them,” said the driver, and for that reason he decided to bring the pups on board.
“I picked up those four pups too and then called the police,” recalled Oleg.
The police contacted the animal shelter, and a worker came to Baltic station to fetch the puppies.
But wasn’t the bus driver tempted to keep these furballs?
Yes, it occurred to me.
One of the puppies was so nice and calm.
Sat nicely like an adult dog,” said Oleg.
But where would I put eight puppies?
My wife would have kicked me out of the flat along with the fogs.
We have a small child, too.
Too early to take a dog,” he added.
Tallinn animal shelter director Eve Tobias said that indeed 8 German shepherd puppies were brought to the shelter, two and a half months old.
But the same day, the owner came to claim the litter.
“We didn’t even register the puppies at the shelter and just returned them,” she said.
“The dog owner wasn’t very cross, but said that they have the only house in the field of vision and the bus driver should have asked whether the puppies were theirs,” said Tobias.
The shelter director added, however, that it was good that the bus driver did pick up the puppies romping near the road, and that nothing unfortunate happened to them.
Actually, it was quite good on the part of the bus driver to react!
Jordan court upholds life sentence for killing of 3 U.S. troops
A military appeals court in Jordan has upheld the life sentence of a Jordanian soldier in the shooting deaths of three U.S. military trainers last year.
First Sgt. Marik al-Tuwayha, was sentenced by a military court last month to life in prison with hard labor for killing the Americans at the entrance to an air base in southern Jordan.
Al-Tuwayha had opened fire at a U.S. convoy, claiming he feared the base was coming under attack.
However, security camera video released after the verdict showed that he kept firing as two of the Americans took cover and waved their arms, in an apparent effort to stop the shooting.
The news website Hala Akhbar, linked to the Jordanian military, reported on Thursday that a five-judge military appeals court upheld al-Tuwayha's sentence.
James Harrison Spends Roughly $300,000 a Year to Keep Body in Playing Shape
Any NFL player relies on his body to make a living.
Many more athletes thus invest heavily on conditioning and recovery to stay in peak shape.
ESPN.com's Jeremy Fowler profiled the deep lengths some veterans take to prolong their careers.
No case is more extreme than James Harrison, the 39-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker preparing for his 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends around $300,000 a year on acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractors and cupping.
Most of the cost stems from traveling across the country to see specialists.
"I don't need to do the checks and balances like that," Harrison said.
"When it comes down to it, what I make versus what I spend, the payout is worth it based on how I feel."
Safety Mike Mitchell, Harrison's Steelers teammate and training partner, estimated a $200,000 annual bill on his body maintenance expenses.
The 30-year-old has tested body tempering, which Fowler described as "basically foam rolling with about 120 pounds of metal."
"Instead of rolling on it, it rolls on you," Mitchell said.
"If you had any knots in your leg and they start moving that thing around, it gets painful at times.
But when you stand up, you're loose immediately.
It just smashes the tension out."
While those go the extra mile, retired NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris labeled $50,000 a fair average on yearly recovery costs.
Cofield, who played for 10 seasons with the New York Giants and Washington Redskins, expressed regret over not spending more.
"If I were to go back, I would invest even more," Cofield told Fowler.
"I'd probably spend twice as much.
I was very healthy the first eight years of my career.
Toward the end, maybe more treatments would have helped."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old linebacker, expressed a willingness to follow the lead of his veteran Steelers teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and you make an extra $3 million playing, that's an easy decision," Shazier said.
In terms of career longevity, investing on player recovery is far smarter than spending on cars and mansions.
The average NFL player is lucky to play beyond 30, so Harrison's success should especially persuade peers to redirect their earnings.
But maybe they can just find local specialists.
Weekend Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Viese tells Õhtuleht that the festival started years ago in Finland and its owners inspected a strip of beach near Riga in regard to expansion, and om the way back they made a stop in Pärnu and that is how the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says their target is set at 25,000 visitors a day, but the chickens are counted only after the festival is over.
The preparations for the festival started back in September last year.
“We were given information from the city that construction would be going on in the last grounds, a hotel was being built there,” says Gunnar as to the change they had to face this year.
Currently no bulldozers can be seen there but it’s presumed that since the earth-moving didn’t start this year, it will next year.
One way or another, we would have had to move at some point,” he says as to why the festival grounds moved this year.
Festival organizing work goes on all year for them.
From 1,000-1,500 people work at Weekend – police, organizing team, volunteers, vendors, security team and so forth.
The hardest thing, Viese said, was getting the Chainsmokers duo to perform at Weekend.
The guys are currently the undisputed top act in the pop music world.
For why it was hard to get the Chainsmokers for Weekend and how does Gunnar comment on the fact that two artists pulled out, watch the video.
Ratas in response to Ansip: we have done a great deal for Estonia’s success.
Vice President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip said in an interview with Kroonika that everyday Estonian politics were sad to look at for him, as the Jüri Ratas government has turned a simple, predictable taxation system upside down.
You took the opportunity to ask me in Kroonika magazine what I have done for Estonia’s success and what I can feel proud of.
It’s gratifying for me that we’re in government as a good team and that in just a few months we have made many important decisions. Estonia has been waiting for many of them for over ten years,” Ratas wrote on social media.
Ratas said the decisions include income tax reform for raising people’s income, pension reform for ensuring the elderly a respectable pension age, local government reform for balancing Estonian development, a rise in agricultural subsidies to stimulate rural life and naturally healthcare reform for offering available and high quality medical care.
“Have a good holiday!” Ratas write to Ansip in his letter.
Talented performers at Pärnu Weekend: drunk man climbs into someone else’s car to sleep
Yesterday evening at 3am, police received a slightly unusual call.
Namely, the owner of an Audi said that a male stranger got into his car at a filling station near Port Artur shopping centre and fell asleep there.
The police patrol that responded found the man, who was startled by the arrival of law enforcement.
The man had apparently become tired along his journey and found a spot in the back seat of a car of someone he didn’t know.
“After being woken by law enforcement, the man continued on his way,” the West prefect said on Facebook.
All’s well that ends well!
You don’t need to go far looking for a good outdoor cinema – the tARTuFF film festival runs from 7-12 August in the Tartu city centre, right on Town Hall Square.
Its focus on love films makes it special.
The programme also includes films that depict the darker side of love, both new works for the screen and good old classics.
Numerous special events in many places turn the university town into a film city for a week.
All of the films are free to the public, there are up to 1,500 seats and this year, an artificial turf area is located right in front of the screen, creating a temporary park-like mood on the city’s main square.
Europe’s biggest open-air cinema in Switzerland accommodates 8,000 cinema-goers at one time.
The Piazza Grande – Grand Square – turns into the heart of the Locarno Film Festival, which runs 2-12 August.
Many films make their premieres during the festival, introduced by acclaimed directors and cast members.
As twilight arrives, 15-20 euros must be shelled out for a ticket to enjoy a film.
Pula Film Festival in the ancient Roman amphitheatre, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, shouting crowds of people, a muddy arena – that was the scene 2, 000 years ago in Pula amphitheatre in Croatia, where an international audience now enjoys films on a summer night in July.
An open-air screen was set up in the ancient Roman structure for the first time in 1953, which makes Pula one of the oldest open-air cinemas in Europe.
Good films have been enjoyed here under the stars by the likes of Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley.
The price is symbolic: an evening of quality films with the roar of the Mediterranean runs about three euros.
The Sala Montjuïc open-air cinema, Spain
Besides films, Sala Montjuïc outdoor cinema offers a splendid view.
It operates on Montjuïc or Jewish Hill, which rises above Barcelona.
In the dark nights of southern Europe, the moat around the fortress on the hill affords a view of all of Barcelona’s festival of lights, which is a sight worth seeing in itself.
Organizers set up a large screen a recess in the moat for July, showing well-known films ranging from La La Land to 1979’s Manhattan.
The cinema accommodates a total of 2,500 people and admission costs 6.50 euros.
The admission price also includes an open-air concert right before the film, which can be accompanied by one’s own picnic basket.
Those who don’t want to sit down on the grass or who have forgotten to pack their picnic blanket can hire a recliner for three euros.
Cinema under the stars, Italy
A true nostalgic Italian ambience can be experienced on Bologna’s central piazza, where restored gems from the local film archive are screened on summer evenings.
Some 3,000-5,000 people can fit in next to the world’s seventh biggest church, the San Petronio Basilica, to watch old films.
The northern Italian buildings, predominantly from the 15th century era of enlightenment, along with the warmth of the summer evening and good company create a romantic atmosphere in which every chilly northerner will melt.
A new film is screened for the audience every evening from 19 June to 15 August, all free of charge.
The Bologna Film Archive festival “Cinema under the stars”.
The Vienna Town Hall Square film festival, Austria
Vienna is a mecca of the music world, even when screening films: The programme of the Wiener Rathausplatz Film Festival consists exclusively of concert recordings and music films.
The 5,000 seats fill up from 30 June to 3 September as if by magic.
Besides classic music stars – concerts by Placido Domingo and the Vienna Philharmonic – the festival offers jazz music in the mornings.
What makes the film summers in Vienna special is the local love for good food – besides world-class music, dishes from the finest restaurants can be enjoyed.
Every day from 11am to midnight, a food and drink area serves up traditional Austrian flavours, and delicacies from Asian, Greek, Italian, Mexican and Indian cuisine.
The dumbest questions to ask a bartender.
Huffington Post reported on questions that bartenders get but wish they didn’t.
What drink do you make the best?
Some drinks do indeed have more ingredients than others, but the same skills and experience go into making them.
Often bartenders interpret the question as “What’s the easiest or fastest for you to make right now?”, which signals that the customer doesn’t care what they drink, whether it is hard to make or not for the bartender.
What’s your favorite drink to make?
This question is also interpreted the same way: what cocktail would be the easiest to get from you right now.
That’s not for the barkeep to say; the customer is the one who makes the decisions based on their wallet.
Instead, bartenders would like to hear the question whether there are any specials at the moment.
What’s served here that’s good?
Maybe there’s a sincere desire to find out whether the bar stands out from others in some way, but this could be asked in a different way.
Nor does a bartender have a clue what a customer might prefer.
Can I get a drink that isn’t very sweet?
As in the previous case, there’s a rule that bartenders aren’t up to speed with your taste and preferences and what is sweet for one person might not be for another person.
However, he is ready to hear you out on what sorts of flavours the cocktail you desire should have.
Will this drink give me a headache/hangover?
A bartender isn’t a doctor or soothsayer to be in a position to solemnly promise anything like that.
The cool summer has Estonians travelling abroad, to the point where package tours aren’t just expensive, but sold out at any price.
Don’t count on there being any cheap airfares and last-minute deals, either; it would be wiser to think ahead to next year’s travel plans.
Man takes model hostage, planning to sell her on the dark web.
A Polish citizen took a British model hostage in Italy.
The man was planning to auction off the 20-year-old woman on the dark Web – the encrypted Internet, the Guardian reported.
The police say the woman was lured to Milan on 11 July with the promise of work on a photo shoot.
Instead, she was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
Allegedly her captors tried to sell her on the dark web for 230,000 pounds and sent a ransom note to her modelling agency.
The woman’s captor took her to the British consulate on 17 July, however.
Police say the suspect is Polish citizen Lukasz Herba, who lives in Britain.
The newspaper Corriere della Sera said the man found out the woman had a small child and did not want to sell her as a sex slave.
Such attempts captivate people.
It would be great if people took the time to think some more and draw conclusions.
The recommendation to investigate the background of people who want to be friends is an obvious one.
In general, everyone should have a strategy concerning what they share about themselves on social media.
At the state level, it should be asked whether officials and politicians are sufficiently well-informed of the dangers lying on social media.
In controlled conditions, the lifespan of fake accounts ended in summer school, but not those of the real evildoers.
From time to time, you have to head to the woods, for whatever reason.
When the chill gets under your skin, it’s time to make a hot tea drink.
In the woods, you’ll find more than what you need for it.
Kaitse Kodu! provides a brief overview.
We talk about tea drinks because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which has a stimulating effect to some degree, but isn’t the best for our health.
When using plants found in the wild, you have to always be ready to experimentation, because recipes and flavours are different
Some plants don’t have to be boiled long; it’s enough to pour hot water on them, while others have to be infused for hours.
Naturally, you have to make sure the water and plants are sufficiently clean and pure.
Much depends on the gathering season and place, too.
We’ll now take a closer look at how to make simple tea drinks and what effect they might have on us.
Pine needle tea
Pine needle tea can be consumed to your heart’s content year-round.
If it’s good to drink 2 litres of water a day, the tea is also suitable for satisfying vitamin C requirements and also giving a little extra energy.
As in the case of all plants, alternative methods can be used for extracting beneficial elements from pine needles, such as by crushing them – the needles don’t have to be boiled long and it is enough to pour hot water over them and let them steep for a few hours.
Use 0.4 litre of needles per half litre of water, and boil for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink that contains close to 25 mg of vitamin C, much potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink also contains about 1.5 sugar cubes’ worth – 20 calories - of sugar.
Lemon and honey can always be added to improve the flavour of the tea.
And if the drink came out very strong, it can be diluted with water like a syrup.
Spruce needle tea can be made the same way, but it tastes a little different.
Raspberry drink is great and helps against many ills, from rheumatism to acne.
Raspberry helps overcome fatigue, has a pain-relieving effect and also wards off colds, easing coughs and lowering fever.
As a result, not more than half a litre should be consumed a day.
Raspberry drink also makes you sweat, so in winter, a quieter moment should be found to enjoy it.
In winter, use raspberry stalks to prepare the beverage, while in summer, use leaves, shoots or berries.
To make half a litre of the drink, you’ll need a small bunch of branches of a suitable length, which should be boiled until the water takes on a reddish tone.
An infusion can also be made from raspberry stalks.
To do this, crush the stalks and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
Processing them longer and more thoroughly will result in a stronger beverage.
Pine needle tea can be added to the ready raspberry drink as a flavouring.
Chaga mushroom tea
Chaga mushroom is a fungus that grows on wood, and in the wild it looks like a piece of charred wood attached to the tree.
It is mostly found on birches, but also elsewhere.
The mushroom has a broad field of uses – as a hot beverage, as a fire-starter, an incense substitute etc.
The ash is also very good for washing oneself.
Chaga tea is a kind of super-beverage that can be used for many different illnesses, even for treating cancer or managing cancer symptoms, as a tonic, for reducing stress and extending lifespan.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and many B-complex vitamins, along with antioxidants and some minerals and protein.
The fungus tea can be consumed every day, no danger of overconsumption.
A piece of fungus measuring about 3 x 3 cm is sufficient for preparing the beverage; boil it in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
As part of a tour of the smaller islands, today Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia’s fourth largest island, Vormsi, where he met local municipality leaders and residents to discuss topical issues in regard to life on the island.
The tour of Vormsi Island started in Sviby harbour, where Prime Minister Ratas was met by Vormsi municipality mayor Tanel Viks and chairman of the municipality council, Ivo Sarapuu.
They first visited historical St. Olav’s Church and the adjacent cemetery, unique in Estonia for its limestone and sandstone circle crosses.
It was followed by a visit to Vormsi Nursery and Basic School where director Age Hälvin conversed with the prime minister about the school’s way of life and the organization of study, where some of the school pupils are enrolled online.
In the morning, the prime minister visited the new and modern operational services centre building opened in 2015, where a meeting with islanders also took place.
At the discussion, key topics for the residents were covered, such as the development of shipping and aviation routes between smaller islands and the mainland.
The state has taken the obligation to ensure regular transport links for permanently settled small islands, but increased traffic in the summer period, for example, makes it more difficult for local people when they have important travel.
These are areas where the state can take the wishes and needs of the locals into account early on, and in the planning process,” said the prime minister.
In addition, the issues of the construction of a marina, hobby education, safety on the island and rescue capability were discussed.
Today’s Vormsi visit was the last stop on the prime minister’s tour of the small islands, in order to get acquainted with the living environment on the islands and to discuss issues awaiting a solution with local inhabitants and municipality leaders.
In July, the head of government Ratas visited Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi and Manilaid, and in August he has visited Naissaar, Prangli and Aegna.
For the first time, the Centre Party is heading into elections without the party’s founder and ideological cornerstone.
To this point, we said Centre Party and we meant Savisaar, or vice versa.
Now the Centre Party has to find its way without him.
They will also have to manoeuvre between the party’s colourful, at times criminal and embarrassing past and the expectations of Savisaar’s supporters within the party and those of voters.
Savisaar’s departure puts the Centre Party in the most complicated situation it has been in ideologically.
On the basis of political practice and ideology to this point, it might be said that the old rhino is just outfoxing them.
A number of cards that were trumps before may not be realized this time.
The populism card doesn’t work for the Centre Party, because Savisaar can always promise more than the prime minister’s party.
Playing the Russian card has become more difficult because of the Centre Party’s position in the government and also because here, too, we see how the so-called Savinova election coalition is stepping on the gas.
The victim card is already in Savisaar’s pocket because of the ongoing court case.
For the Centre Party, the Popular Front card and the card of the poor accursed one is also gone.
The first is not of much value without its founder and the coalition partners in the government keep the second one from being played energetically.
Yet one card may have even greater weight.
Every recent election has confirmed that the parties who are able to articulate the basic conflict of the elections and then fulfil it will be successful.
The basic conflict has always revolved around Savisaar himself.
If any party should have the idea of reviving this ever-effective conflict, the Center Party’s deck of cards is once again short one trump ace.
What will the Centre Party be left with then?
They still have a strong party machine and noteworthy resources.
There will enough ribbon-cuttings before the elections, too.
Most of the shameless self-promotion four years ago using taxpayer money has hopefully been repaid by now.
The Tallinn city media still exists, but less partisan guerrilla journalism being practised there these days.
Besides that, the party has vote magnets.
Their role this time will be to pull it out of the fire, as the image of ruling party is not sufficient to significantly motivate voters.
In the ideological scheme of things, Jüri Ratas will have to find his own way, as the journey with Savisaarism ended this week.
Three US Marines missing in Australian waters in an air crash.
The US Navy and Marine Corps called off a search, the Marine base Camp Butler in Japan said in a statement, essentially conforming that the military had no more hopes of finding the missing alive.
The accident occurred with a Marine Osprey MV-22 aircraft that took off from aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board, of whom 23 were found and rescued.
The aircraft that crashed into the sea took part in joint US-Australian exercises in Shoalwater Bay in Queensland.
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said Saturday’s incident occurred near the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
Woman finds unknown person’s wedding ring in washing machine – who could it belong to?
“I started taking the clothes out of the washer when I saw something glinting between the rubber seal of the washing machine,” said the woman about how she found an unknown person’s wedding ring in her washing machine.
Actually, Karin didn’t really investigate the shiny object in the door of the washing machine at first.
I turned on the washing machine again.
“Two young children produce a lot of dirty laundry,” the woman chuckles.
When the next cycle ended and I started taking the wash out, the glint between the rubber seal the washing machine caught my eye and that’s when I found the ring.
Engraved on the gold wedding ring was the name of a man who had got married 14 years ago – Tomi.
As there wasn’t anyone in the family by that name, man or woman, who might be married to Tomi, the ring is a total mystery.
Karin asked her oldest child whether perhaps she had found the ring outside, put it in her pocket, after which the ring ended up in the washing machine at some point, but the daughter said that she hadn’t brought any rings home.
Karin has been living with her partner in an apartment in Tallinn for a year now.
Before that they rented it out and the washing machine is from that time as well.
But if the ring was somehow connected to the tenants, how did it end up in the machine?
“Now I’m baffled and I don’t understand how the ring wound up in the washing machine,” the woman laughs.
Because her life is quite fast-paced with her two young children, the ring lay on a cupboard for a while, forgotten.
“Recently there have been posts where someone is looking for the owner of a wedding ring, and now it seemed that it was high time to look for the owner of the ring that I found,” says Karin referring to an case on social media where a wedding ring found on Puhangu tänav in Tallinn was happily reunited with its owner last week.
“As various items are reported lost and found on Facebook, I thought I would try my luck there first,” said Karin, whose post has been shared by close to 4,000 people already.
“The post has received all kinds of feedback, not all of it good,” sighs Karin, saying that the first comments recommended that she take her husband to task.
At that point, I had the feeling of, do I need this crap right now.
That my husband has become the biggest cheater anyone’s heard of.
To be honest, it had me worried at first, but later, when other comments suggested that maybe I had been up to monkey business with the owner of the ring, that made me laugh.
Some commenters also suggested the idea that perhaps the ring had been in the pocket of second-hand clothing.
“Well, about six months ago, I did buy some second-hand slacks that I can wear to work, which I threw in the washing machine without examining them carefully, but really?” the woman muses to herself.
Be that as it may, but I agreed with my partner that we have to find the owner of the ring now as a matter of principle.
Whatever the reason for the disappearance of the ring.
Divorce, domestic strife, or whatever.
I think that’s the right thing to do. Because if I should ever lose my wedding ring, I know I would be totally grateful to a person who tried to find me and return my valuable possession.
Karin has also turned to the vital statistics office for help in finding the person.
I got the response that no gentleman by that name got married on that day in Estonia.
One ring has found its owner
Recently the wedding ring found on 21 July in the Pelgulinn part of Tallinn was happily reunited with its owner as the engraving gave reason to believe that it belonged to an elderly woman.
“I was walking my dog in the morning when I noticed a golden ring behind the building at Puhangu 53 in a well-trodden dirt path,” says Gerli. The engraving gave reason to believe that it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photograph of the ring (pictured) on her Facebook page and in the group Märgatud Tallinnas (Seen in Tallinn), and shared the information with the North-Tallinn district and the Northern Prefecture.
Two weeks later the police contacted her and notified her that the ring wearer had been identified.
“I contacted the daughter of the owner and on Monday evening I handed the ring to the daughter.” The rings had been lost because the older woman had injured her hand and put the ring on her other finger, and it then slipped off.
“She lost it on the morning of the same day that I was walking my dog,” says Gerli.
Although the media’s attention has been mainly focused on Pärnu and the Weekend festival taking place there, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
Põlvamaa’s Intsikurmu festival has its loyal fans, too.
One of them writes on Twitter: “I sold off my Weekend ticket so I could go to Intsikurmu.”
And why not.
Besides domestic artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere will take the stage.
The festival held in a magical forest comes as a surprise for the performers, too, due to its location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, on Twitter in the early morning, couldn’t get over how beautiful a place Estonia was.
But neither have festivalgoers not been stingy in sharing nifty facts and observations.
To be a part of Intsikurmu festival magic yourself, view the gallery!
Estonian U18 team concedes defeat to Great Britain and won’t make it into division A
The game started at an extremely fast pace and a number of baskets were scored in the first quarter, at the end of which the Brits led by five, 23-18.
In the second quarter, the lead grew and the visitors went up by nine, 40-31.
The Estonians managed to outscore the opponents in the third quarter but only by one point.
The Estonians were down by eight (54-46) going into the final ten minutes.
In the fourth quarter, the Estonians’ game broke down completely and they had to settle for a 75-61 loss.
The loss dashed the Estonian’ hopes of making it into division A, where only the two best teams advance.
In tomorrow’s third-place game, Estonia will go up against the winner of the Croatia-Israel game.

Australian codes are at the crossroads
Professional sport in Australia is at the crossroads: some have travelled so far down the corporate path, they are too business-oriented to be called a sport.
Others are retreating back along the amateur path, too inherently sport-minded to be considered a business.
The tortured delay in Cricket Australia reaching a pay deal with its players; the indecision of the Australia Rugby Union in sacking a team; the revolt by stakeholders of Football Federation Australia; rugby league's problems in achieving a functioning independent commission and the AFL's relentless push to be standard-bearers of social equity in the nation are evidence of this confusion.
John Wylie, an investment banker and chair of the Australian Sports Commission, has been active in taking the Olympic sports down the same route as the professional codes, installing businessmen with no elite experience in a sport as chairs.
Mining giant Rio Tinto, with its reputation for union-busting tactics, was seen as the ogre in CA's problems in reaching an agreement with the Australian Cricketers Association.
CA chair David Peever is a former managing director of Rio Tinto Australia and recruited a Rio Tinto executive and an adviser to assist CA on the pay negotiations.
However, it would be a mistake to assume elite businessmen who take a ruthless approach to dealing with cricketers don't love sport.
Peever, for example, was a frequent attendee at Storm home games until he moved inter-state.
Nevertheless, the brutal negotiations between CA and the ACA and the stratospheric salaries paid has produced the perception that Australia's favourite summer pastime is now more of a business than a sport.
By contrast, the inept leadership of the ARU by former NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne, in failing to cull an Australian Super Rugby team, has pushed the code back to its roots.
Rugby union people now prefer to stroll down to a suburban oval to watch a game between amateur teams, while sipping on a beer and eating a hot dog.
Rugby union boasts it has the most corporately qualified and diverse board in Australia, yet the failure of the code, when challenged by the demands of its international partners, exposes it as still too much of a sport to be a business.
Both rugby league and soccer face problems over governance, with demands from stakeholders for more power.
The heads of both codes, the ARLC's John Grant and FFA's Steven Lowy, have demonstrated that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, a former Kangaroo, led a successful IT company but was effectively absent from the game for 20 years.
This became an asset when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chair.
The code's stakeholders, none of whom trusted each other, decided that no one could sit on the commission if he/she had been involved with rugby league in any way in the previous three years, apart from being a passive fan.
The pendulum swung too far to business and the fans of the code have been seeking a saviour, one with a celebrated past in the sport, since.
Lowy, the chief executive of Westfield's overseas investments, inherited the FFA's chairman's role from his father, Frank, one of Australia's richest individuals.
The A-League clubs want greater representation on the congress that elects the board.
Their owners are losing money but believe they have the gravitas of a Manchester United.
Ironically, that great bastion of sport/business ethics, FIFA, is sending out emissaries to end the sport's civil war.
The AFL has its own links to Rio Tinto via recently retired chairman Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL commissioner Chris Lynch, the mining giant's CFO.
The code boasts a national leadership role in promoting gender equity, Indigenous and refugee causes and gay rights.
A cynic might suggest this is done with an eye on government grants.
The AFL chairman, Richard Goyder, said, when replacing Fitzpatrick, "The AFL is more than a business because of the way that it reaches into all these communities."
Goyder is the outgoing chief executive of Wesfarmers and the first chair of the AFL who has not played the game at the elite level.
A former Wesfarmers chairman, Bob Every, sits on the board of Cricket Australia.
The common thread in many of the appointments to the boards of professional sports is the promotion of independence over competence.
In the rush to recruit top business people, they have neglected what might be called the affection and affinity for a sport.
Furthermore, many of the corporate heavyweights are not accustomed to the intense - sometimes personal - scrutiny from the media.
What might work in the corporate world doesn't necessarily translate to the world of sport.
Flynn files amended disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served briefly as President Trump's national security adviser, filed an amended federal financial disclosure report late Thursday providing new details about his contracts with the Trump presidential transition, a company connected to an Iranian American businessman, and the parent company of a data science firm that worked for the Trump campaign.
In a letter accompanying his revised disclosure, Flynn noted that his initial disclosure reports were filed under rushed circumstances without the customary consultation and review provided by White House lawyers and the Office of Government Ethics.
The letter said Flynn did not receive the attention afforded others because he was no longer a White House employee at the time.
Flynn resigned his post just 24 days after taking office amid reports that he misled Vice President Pence about the nature of his contacts after the election with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Flynn also drew criticism over foreign payments he received while working in the private sector after stepping down as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In a previous disclosure to House investigators Flynn reported receiving nearly $68,000 in fees and expenses from Russia-related entities in 2015.
In addition to the Russia-related income, Thursday's filing showed that Flynn received at least $5,000 as a consultant to a project to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on that project had been disclosed previously, but it was not known that he was paid.
The updated disclosure also confirms that Flynn had agreed to work with the SCL Group, at the time the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica, a data science company hired by Donald Trump's campaign.
One of Cambridge's main financiers is hedge fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential conservative donor.
The Washington Post reported in February that Flynn had been hired as an adviser to SCL Group.
Flynn was tapped to help the American subsidiary of SCL win new U.S. government contracts, according to people familiar with his role.
SCL also hired one of Flynn's former colleagues from Office of the Director of National Intelligence to lead its government contracting efforts.
Flynn received no compensation from SCL and performed no actual work, according to a person familiar with his activities.
The new filing disclosed that Flynn received about $28,000 from the Trump Presidential Transition.
The largest source of income disclosed is $140,000 for Flynn's work as an adviser and consultant to Minneapolis-based NJK Holding Corp. That firm is led by Nasser Kazeminy, an Iranian-born businessman now living in the United States.
The Associated Press reported Thursday evening that NJK issued a statement saying that Flynn "played an advisory role to NJK holdings relative to its investment interests in security."
NJK funds a technology firm called GreenZone Systems to which Flynn serves as vice chairman.
GreenZone is led by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner in Flynn Intel, a company now under scrutiny for its role in lobbying work for a Dutch-based business linked to the government of Turkey.
Earlier Thursday, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), asked Kian to provide information about Flynn's foreign business contacts and travel.
At the time of a previous security review on Flynn, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
But Flynn did not tell the same investigators about those contacts, according to Cummings.
A person familiar with the situation said Flynn nonetheless received his security clearance at the time.
Headliner at Augustibluus festival requires resuscitation on stage, taken to Tallinn by ambulance
Ivan managed to finish the set, when he was stricken.
The ambulance was called, and they performed CPR for 20 minutes or more,” organizer Indrek Ditmann told Elu24.
“The other performances were delayed but the festival will go on,” he says and adds: “The public has been notified, of course they also saw everything going on on stage.”
At the moment, Ivan is on the way to Tallinn by ambulance and it isn’t known if he will make it or not.
Of course, we’re hoping for the best,” said Ditmann in closing.
A witness told Lääne Elu that Denisenko was stricken while performing.
First he stopped singing, then he started missing notes on his instrument, and he fell on his back while on stage.
The MC, Jan Uuspõld, came on stage and asked whether there was a doctor in the audience.
A little later he asked for prayers for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko/Augustibluus
Ivan Denisenko aka Ivan Blues is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure.
Ivan’s musical career started in parallel with his art studies at the Ukrainian National Art and Architecture Academy.
At university, his deep bass voice impressed and he was invited to perform with the nationally known folk choir Golden Gate.
At school, he made friends with people who turned him on to the blues and later became his bandmates.
The first concert by Ivan Blues & Friends took place on 31 December 2007 at a Kyiv bar called Rag-Time.
Since that time, the band has been playing regularly in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes book in Tagalog
A Helping Hand is the first book from Ms Michaels, a former BBC editor and mother-of-two, who has previously written for Singapore Tatler.
It took three years to complete and is dedicated to her Filipina helpers, Maricon Espiritu and Ginalyn Narag, who help with cooking and looking after son, Joseph, four, and daughter, Florence, eight.
The helpers, who she described as "part of the family," helped test the recipes during the writing of the book, which is the first of its kind in Singapore to be published in English and Tagalog.
A Helping Hand is available in bookstores across Singapore for SG$39.90 and in expat hubs including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He Thought He Had Caught His Co-Worker's Stomach Bug.
Why Were His Symptoms So Different?
In the E.R., he was given high-dose acetaminophen to bring his fever down.
And he spent the rest of the day being questioned, prodded, poked and scanned.
None of the tests were revealing, but no one wanted to send him home, either.
He understood why.
For the past two years, he'd been taking a medication called etanercept for Sjogren's syndrome.
The drug works by tamping down the immune system, and that limited his ability to fight off infections.
Sjogren's is an autoimmune disorder - a somewhat mysterious type of disease in which the body's own white blood cells attack normal tissue as if it were an invading organism - in this case wreaking havoc on the glands that make tears and saliva, as well as on some of the joints.
A weekly injection of etanercept had been helpful, eliminating his joint pain.
But he knew that because of this drug, he was almost helpless in the face of a serious infection.
Once the acetaminophen kicked in, the patient felt much better.
The E.R. doctors decided to admit him overnight.
If, as the doctors suspected, he had a virus, he'd be fine the next day and could go home.
When Girard first heard about her new patient, she read up on the infections to which people who took etanercept were susceptible.
It was a long list.
Viruses couldn't be treated before diagnosis, so she focused on bacterial infections.
One bacterium that attacks those with immune deficiencies is food-borne and called listeria.
It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheeses and tends to cause horrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which he didn't have.
Legionella pneumonia is another infection more common in those who take the medication, but he didn't have a cough and wasn't short of breath.
A much more common bug, staph aureus, could cause joint infections - though again, he didn't have any complaints about his joints.
Still, she planned to start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all these threats.
But when she met him, he didn't look like someone who had a terrible infection.
The doctors in the E.R. hadn't given him antibiotics.
She could hold off on the antibiotics and just watch and wait - but if he had one of the infections she'd read about, delaying treatment even a few hours could be deadly.
To make matters more complicated, he thought he was allergic to penicillin - though he couldn't remember what happened when he took it.
This shifted the risk-benefit ratio.
The normally low-stakes decision of whether to start an antibiotic changed when doing so could be so dangerous.
She asked a colleague, another resident, to assess the patient.
Girard didn't tell her co-worker that she planned on an antibiotic; she just asked her to see the patient and give a recommendation.
The co-worker saw the patient and agreed.
Even though he looked well, if he had an infection, he was practically defenseless against it.
She should give him the antibiotics.
Because he had a history of a penicillin allergy, Girard would have to test him to make sure he could tolerate the medication, which was not penicillin but a close cousin.
Girard ordered a test dose to be given.
If he was going to have a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have a rash or his blood pressure would drop.
Neither happened.
So he got the full dose.
A couple of hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient had spiked a temperature of 102.
She ran down to see him.
His face was shiny with a thin layer of sweat, and his cheeks were rosy.
And though he looked uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
Thank goodness she'd given him antibiotics, she thought to herself.
She ordered another dose of Tylenol, and when she came back for one final look at him, he was sound asleep.
His temperature was gone.
The sweaty gleam and rosy cheeks had disappeared.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for her overnight shift, the first thing she did was check on this patient.
She had admitted five other patients, but he was the one she worried about from home after signing him over to the day team.
In the hours since she last saw him, his blood had grown an organism in the lab.
It was too early to know precisely what it was.
But it was clear that it was bacteria robust enough to grow quickly in a petri dish and that it wasn't staph aureus or Legionella.
The list of other possibilities was long, and none really seemed to fit.
It was another two days before they could finally identify the bug.
It was listeria.
Girard - and just about everyone caring for the man - was surprised.
As a physician, you get these pictures in your head about diseases.
For Girard, listeriosis was a disease that you got from unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses and that caused nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
She did a little more reading on the unusual infection and found that while people with normal immune systems may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly, like the patient's co-worker.
In pregnant women, people over 65 or anyone with an impaired immune system, however, the infection can break out of the digestive tract - sometimes without manifesting the typical symptoms - and get into the bloodstream.
From there it can spread like wildfire through the entire body.
This form of the infection, called invasive listeriosis, can be fatal up to 30 percent of the time in these patients.
Indeed, though less common than botulism, listeriosis can be just as deadly.
Early treatment with antibiotics can be lifesaving.
If this was a food-borne illness, which food had carried the bacteria?
Though the man and his co-worker did not have unpasteurized milk or soft cheese on their trip, an internet search showed an outbreak of listeria this summer in Scotland linked to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they had shared some smoked salmon.
Exactly where they'd picked up the bug remained a mystery.
Once the medical team knew what he had, they could tailor the antibiotics.
He completed his three-week treatment in July.
His doctors instructed him to take it easy for the rest of the summer, but at this point he feels mostly back to normal and has returned to his museum and the work he loves.
He Won Praise for Halting a Global Cyberattack.
Then He Was Arrested.
When the Kronos malware was first advertised in underground Russian forums in 2014, the asking price of $7,000 indicated that the selling of malware was a lucrative business.
Kronos was promoted as a hacking tool that could retrieve data including user names and passwords, A.T.M. PINs, and personal information useful in cracking security questions.
Earlier on Thursday, Motherboard reported that Mr. Hutchins had been detained at the Las Vegas airport after a week of attending both the Black Hat and Defcon security conferences.
He had been scheduled to fly back to his home in the United Kingdom.
The security community reacted with surprise and skepticism over the arrest of one of its well-regarded stars.
Some warned that claims against Mr. Hutchins could strain the relationship between "white hat" hackers - researchers who look for software vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or sow chaos - and law enforcement.
Others were unconvinced that Mr. Hutchins would create such software for an attack.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter if anyone had a Kronos sample - a seemingly odd request if he had created the malware.
While the exact circumstances of Mr. Hutchins's involvement with the Kronos malware were unclear, security researchers have often skirted legal trouble while looking for vulnerabilities in computer code.
In recent years, big tech companies have created "bug bounties" to formalize a process for researchers to report problems and to be compensated for their work.
The Defcon conference, a freewheeling gathering of security experts from around the world, has also had a touchy relationship with law enforcement.
In 2002, for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a Russian encryption expert in his Las Vegas hotel room after he published software officials said could crack the security of some kinds of e-books.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, said in a statement that it was concerned about the arrest of Mr. Hutchins and was looking into the matter.
The WannaCry ransomware infected computers running older versions of Microsoft Windows.
Once spread, the software encrypted computers and locked users out of files, folders and drives.
If an affected machine was connected to a network, other computers on the network could become infected as well.
The attackers demanded that victims pay hundreds of dollars to a Bitcoin address.
Mr. Hutchins was something of an accidental hero.
According to an interview with The Guardian in May, Mr. Hutchins said he registered a website domain after discovering that the malicious software was trying to connect to it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he triggered a so-called kill switch that halted the software's spread.
His intention initially was not to stop the attack but to track its spread.
Mr. Hutchins, who works as a researcher for Kryptos Logic, a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity firm, said in the interview that he had skipped going to college and taught himself how to write software.
The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through his handle MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was celebrated in the cybersecurity community for his achievement, winning a special recognition award at an SC Awards Europe industry event.
Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner, confirmed by Senate as UK ambassador
Mr Johnson was a top donor to Mr Trump during the presidential campaign, and was named in November as finance chair of his inaugural committee.
A long-time Republican donor, Mr Johnson helped raise money for George W Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were the party's nominees.
He served as finance chairman for Jeb Bush earlier in the 2016 campaign.
Mr Johnson's great grandfather founded Johnson & Johnson, the medical supplies manufacturer.
Matthew Barzun was the previous US ambassador to the UK.
He was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama and stepped down in January this year, before Mr Trump's inauguration.
Belgian authorities knew of egg contamination back in June
“We knew back in early June that there were possible problems with the insecticide fipronil,” said Katrien Stragier, the press representative of the authority responsible for food safety in Belgium, in an interview with the TV channel VRT.
We immediately started an investigation and talked about the matter with the prosecutor’s office, as it could be fraud.
From there on, the investigation became classified.
We understand that people have questions about health and we will try to answer them,” added Stagier.
In recent days, the news agency AFP tried to get information from the prosecutor dealing with the matter, but the prosecutor did not say anything as the judge in the investigation prohibited disclosure of information.
Chicken eggs have been removed from shelves in Belgium as a precautionary measure until the test results come back.
Millions of Dutch eggs have been removed from shelves in the Netherlands and Germany
German Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt has called for Dutch and Belgian officials to bring clarity to the matter quickly.
“Someone clearly criminally contaminated the eggs with a prohibited product,” Schmidt told German newspaper Bild.
According to Estonian Veterinary and Food Board (VTA), none of the pesticide contaminated eggs produced in Netherlands are likely to be in Estonia.
“Our information is that there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia.” VTA spokesman Martin Altraja told BNS.
He added that there are no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia, either.
According to Statistics Estonia, no eggs have been imported from Netherlands to Estonia in the last 10 years.
The last time eggs were imported from Netherlands was in 2006.
Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil was introduced into chicken farms due to an attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to treat chicken infested with lice.
Reports in Dutch and Belgian media that the pesticide-containing substance reached Chickfriend via a Belgian company are as yet unconfirmed.
According to the World Health Organization, fipronil is moderately hazardous in larger quantities and can have negative effects on human kidneys, liver and thyroid, above all in children.
Is there finally some relief from annoying robocalls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is too often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, depends on customers calling to order wings, pizza and potato skins.
But much of the time, it's an automated message pushing a scam.
"It's getting to the point where it's blocking other callers from coming in," the 24-year-old bar owner said.
Help is coming, if slowly.
Over the past year, prodded by the government, cellphones have added new tools to counteract unwanted "robocalls."
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed letting phone companies block more spam and is hoping to deter scammers with big fines.
Experts say these steps are not a cure-all, but they're a good start.
The federal and state "Do Not Call" lists are supposed to protect people from unwanted calls from telemarketers.
But scammers don't care about breaking the law.
Scammers reach people cheaply and easily using "autodialers," which spew out a large number of calls automatically.
It's estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robocalls every day.
Not all of them are fraudsters, of course.
Pharmacies send automated messages about prescriptions being filled.
But too often, it's this: you owe the IRS money; it's Microsoft calling to fix your computer; free cruises!
And spam callers have tricky technology that makes a phone's caller ID display a local or important-looking caller, like the IRS.
Cracking down on "spoofed" numbers would make running a scam more difficult and save U.S. consumers millions of dollars, a group of state attorneys general said in an FCC filing.
Phone companies and independent apps can screen or block unwanted calls by checking them against databases of known problem numbers and analyzing suspicious behavior, like a number that's calling lots of people on Do Not Call lists.
Wireless carriers also have tools that flag incoming calls with warnings like "scam likely," but they aren't available on all phones, or to many prepaid customers.
The versions from Verizon and Sprint cost extra.
A few Android phones, including Google's Pixel, screen spam calls for free.
Jen Vargas, 39, a multimedia producer from Orlando, Florida, said her AT&T app flags and blocks some fraudulent calls to her cellphone, but she's given up with the landline.
"Very rarely do I pick up a call from a number I don't know," Vargas said.
Apps including YouMail and Nomorobo offer relief on home phones for free, with limitations.
With YouMail, your carrier must allow "conditional call forwarding," which forwards calls if a line is unanswered or busy.
Nomorobo isn't available through all home phone providers and won't work with older, copper-based landlines.
You can also buy gadgets, some pretty clunky, that block calls on home phones.
Verizon is also testing warnings about suspicious calls on a home phone's caller ID display.
Phone companies can already block some calls that are being faked.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalize that practice and permit them to block other calls they suspect are scams.
That means Verizon can block a toll-free number that accepts calls for a bank but never initiates a call.
Carriers would also be able to block calls they know aren't legitimate, like a number with a 911 area code.
The rules still need to be finalized.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy fellow at the nonprofit Consumers Union, said the development is "promising," but won't protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
For one thing, "Do Not Call" lists don't apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, Mahoney said, the FCC rules would cover only faked numbers.
Not all robocalls are spoofed.
Consumers Union wants phone companies to make call-blocking tools available to all consumers for free.
In the longer term, the FCC supports industry efforts to verify that callers are really who they say they are.
Perhaps one day, you'll see a green checkmark on your smartphone when the caller is legitimate.
U.S. Telecom, the phone-company lobby, says rolling this out could take a few years, but would prove powerful against robocallers.
The FCC is also seeking ways to stop annoying calls from dogging consumers when they change numbers.
Today, if you sign up for Do Not Call but then get a new number, a marketer may not know and could pester you on your new line.
"Robocallers aren't going away," said Aaron Foss of Nomorobo, a call-blocking service for cellphones and home phones.
"These guys are criminals and they're going to find their way around any system.
But it's our job to make sure we make it as difficult for them as possible."
There are common-sense measures for consumers to follow.
Don't answer the phone if you don't recognize the number.
Yes, this is impractical on business phone lines, like Sports City's.
Hang up on unwanted callers.
Don't talk to them or press any buttons.
If you engage with them, they might flag you as someone who's responsive and inundate you with more calls.
Block the number after the call, if possible.
Use call-blocking apps.
If you have privacy concerns, check the app's policy to see if it's sharing your call or contacts data with marketers.
Don't give callers personal information, like bank account or Social Security numbers.
Rasmus Mägi: training hasn’t gone exactly as I imagined it would
“It hasn’t been exactly as I imagined it,” Mägi said regarding the training that preceded the world championships.
Friday and Saturday are key moments that will show what shape his body is in exactly.
And the competition will reveal everything, so what point is there to analyse here.
Right now, I feel that my training as been high in quality, both this year and in years past, so on the strength of all that, I can run pretty solid.
Mägi, who will start in preliminary heats on Sunday at 13:05 Estonian time, hasn’t been up to much of anything since the domestic championships.
People often overdo it in practice in the last weeks.
I should be fresh and it could work in my favour that the last week before the world championships was a little lighter.
In terms of the physical side, the days left until the start go like this: yesterday, the hurdler rested, today he has a warmup practice.
He doesn’t want to delve too deep into his mental preparation: “Like anyone, I’ve developed my routines over time.
There’s a lot of peace and quiet and I don’t let any rock music into my ears.
I don’t need to watch any motivational videos or read self-help books, but rather just be where I am and appreciate the fact at that moment that athletes have gathered from around the world to see how they measure up to each other in terms of ability.
That alone makes it special.
The world championships are naturally a top event of the year for track and field athletes and Mägi has started every race in the past, including races in the Diamond League, as an experiment – tried out some technical nuance, pitted himself against a competitor.
At the title championships, there’s no more possibility for experimentation.
“Here the goal is just to run fast,” says Mägi, but adds that if he manages to reserve even a percent or two of his energy in the preliminary heat and potential in the semi-final, that will definitely help him in the next race.
Finns hold dance festival for their men
When the first men’s dance festival was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organizers probably didn’t dream that the northern neighbours would use the small Estonian city as an example.
But today Lapua in western Finland is holding the first Finnish men’s dance festival.
“The representatives of Lapua were so inspired by the last men’s dance festival held in the sister city that they wanted to do something similar,” said Rakvere’s deputy mayor, Kairit Pihlak.
And so today in Lapua’s baseball stadium, there will be two performances of Mies-Tanssipido, where 100 men from the Virumaa region of northern Estonia will also take part, as part of the Finnish national centenary celebrations, said Pihlak.
Pihlak said it was a superb example of good cooperation between two friendship cities
It also marks the centenary years for the republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundred dancers is the winner of Rakett 69 from two seasons ago, Kari Reinkubjas.
“I have the honour to be one of a hundred men, who by taking part in Finland, show what Viru men are capable of,” he said.
“Rakvere’s dancing men have limbered themselves up in preparation for the Finnish men’s dance festival so that they can show a proper calibre at our northern neighbours,” Rakvere city government member Ain Suurkaev commented on the event.
The Virumaa men’s performance has been arranged into a whole by the artistic director of the dance ensemble Tarvanpää, Tiiu Mürk, along with well-known choir conductor Elo Üleoja.
The Estonians’ choreography is based on Estonian choral music.
The first Estonian men’s dance festival was held in 2006, and the last one to date was in Rakvere in 2015.
Awaiting the evening discus throw final: will Gerd Kanter make world championship history?
The current World Championships are Kanter’s eighth, and none of his competitors in London have attained such an accomplishment.
Besides that, Kanter is the only discus thrower in history to have won the complete medal cycle (a gold, two silvers and two bronzes) at the World Championships.
As of today (5 August 2017) Kanter is 38 years and 92 days old.
Should the Estonian hurl himself into a two-time world champion, he would be the oldest discus thrower to have won a gold at the world championships.
The Polish hero Pjotr Malachowski has the same opportunity (he is 34 years and 60 days old).
Some more exciting facts:
Athletes from only two countries have become world champions more than once.
Germany has nine gold medals, Lithuania has two.
The world championship record belongs to Virgilijus Alekna, which was the 70.17 hurled in Helsinki (2005).
The shortest throw that won a title is 66.20 – Riedel managed this (in 1991).
Cockroaches spread seeds, too, research shows
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds, too.
The insects are mostly known for their role as decomposers, helping to break down decaying matter on the forest floor.
But cockroaches also help disperse seeds.
Scientists in Japan found cockroaches were essential to the seed dispersal of a forest herb species, Monotropastrum humile.
The herb is an unusual plant.
It has no chlorophyl, leaving it unable to perform photosynthesis.
Instead, the species gets its nutrients from fungi growing beneath the soil's surface.
The plant drops tiny, odorless, pale white fruits on the forest floor.
The fruits have little to no flavor, and researchers in Japan found bird and mammal species were uninterested in the food source.
Only a handful of invertebrate consumed the fruit's pulp, and the forest cockroach, Blattella nipponica, was the only species to visit the fruit consistently.
Researchers examined cockroach feces to determine whether the insects helped disperse the plant's seeds.
Scientists found each feces pellet expelled after eating the fruit featured an average of three seeds.
Further testings proved the majority of digested seeds were viable.
Scientists hypothesize that the unique herb species likely evolved to take advantage of the cockroach's ability to disperse seeds.
The plant hangs its fruit at ground level, and the fruits ripen at the same time cockroaches emerge from their pupa stage.
Researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"Given that about 4,600 cockroach species have been identified to date, cockroach-mediated seed dispersal may be a more pervasive but an as yet undocumented mechanism, rather than a unique exploit by a particular plant species," Naoto Sugiura, an associate professor at Kumamoto University, said in a news release.
"It is hoped that the findings reported here will encourage people to pay more attention to plant-cockroach interactions and seek out further examples of cockroach-mediated seed dispersal."
Duchess of Cambridge's childhood friend should have had 'right to die'
A terminally-ill childhood friend of the Duchess of Cambridge should have been allowed to take her own life, her mother has said.
Isobel Kennerley, who was a member of the Duchess's Brownie pack, had begged to be allowed to die after a three-year battle with a brain tumour that left her with "the utmost pain, distress and loss of dignity."
The 34-year-old, who had cerebral palsy, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2014 but suffered horrifically before she eventually died in May, her mother has said.
Christine Eeley, 65, from Newbury, Berks, has called for a change in the law to enable terminally-ill and mentally competent people to be able to "control the manner and the timing" of their deaths.
She said she had been left "traumatised" by her daughter's painful death and wished the law had allowed her to put a plan in place that would have enabled her daughter to die with dignity when her condition deteriorated.
China's Internet Censors Play a Tougher Game of Cat and Mouse
The shift - which could affect a swath of users from researchers to businesses - suggests that China is increasingly worried about the power of the internet, experts said.
"It does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense, but the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been," said Emily Parker, author of "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are," a book about the power of the internet in China, Cuba, and Russia.
Beijing's crackdown on the internet is commensurate with the power of the internet in China.
China still has not clamped down to its full ability, the experts said, and in many cases the cat-and-mouse game continues.
One day after Apple's move last week, people on Chinese social media began circulating a way to gain access to those tools that was so easy that even a non-techie could use it.
It involved registering a person's app store to another country where VPN apps were still available.
Still, Thursday's test demonstrates that China wants the ability to change the game in favor of the cat.
A number of Chinese internet service providers said on their social media accounts, websites, or in emails on Thursday that Chinese security officials would test a new way to find the internet addresses of services hosting or using illegal content.
Once found, these companies said, the authorities would ask internet service providers to tell their clients to stop.
If the clients persisted, they said, the service providers and Chinese officials would cut their connection in a matter of minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
Studies suggest that anywhere from tens of millions to well over a hundred million Chinese people use VPNs and other types of software to get around the Great Firewall.
While the blocks on foreign television shows and pornography ward off many people, they often pose only minor challenges to China's huge population of web-savvy internet users.
China's president, Xi Jinping, has presided over years of new internet controls, but he has also singled out technology and the internet as critical to China's future economic development.
As cyberspace has become more central to everything that happens in China, government controls have evolved.
It is difficult to figure out the extent of the new efforts, since many users and businesses will not discuss them publicly for fear of getting on the bad side with the Chinese government.
But some frequent users said that getting around the restrictions had become increasingly difficult.
One student, who has been studying in the United States and was back in China for summer vacation, said that her local VPN was blocked.
She said she had taken the period as a sort of meditation away from social media and left a note on Facebook to warn her friends why she was a "gone girl."
A doctoral student in environmental engineering in at a university in China said it had become harder to do research without Google, though his university had found alternative publications so that students did not always need the internet.
He has since found a new way to get around the Great Firewall, the student said, without disclosing what it was.
Close observers of the Chinese internet said some VPNs still work - and that China could still do a lot more to intensify its crackdown.
"We do think that if the government has decided to do so, it could have shut down much more VPN usage right now," said a spokesman for VPNDada, a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs that work.
"If the government had sent more cats, the mice would have a tougher time," said the spokesman, who declined to be named because of sensitivities around the group's work in China.
"I guess they didn't do so because they need to give some air for people or businesses to breathe."
China's online crackdowns are often cyclical.
The current climate is in part the result of the lead-up to a key Chinese Communist Party meeting, the 19th Party Congress this autumn.
Five years ago, ahead of a similar meeting, VPNs were hit by then-unprecedented disruptions.
Much like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complicated and often imperfect political process.
Government ministries feel pressure ahead of the party congress to show they are effective or can step in if a problem appears, analysts said.
"So it's definitely not an apocalypse for VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.
"Just a more complex environment for users to navigate, and new capabilities and approaches give China better ability to shut off some delta of VPN use at a time and place of Beijing's choosing," he said.
China's population is learning to deal with those difficulties at a younger age.
Earlier this summer, China's internet giant Tencent began limiting the time that people under 18 were allowed to play the popular online game Honor of Kings to an hour a day for those under 12, and two hours for those age 12 to 18.
So Chinese youths have taken to an age-old solution: getting a fake ID.
"Your Honor of Kings being limited?
Interested in getting an over-18 identification?" read a recent advertisement on Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Get in touch for a low-price ID."

Cancer-nursing cat Genie named Cat of the Year
A rescue cat that helped its owner through bone cancer treatment has been named National Cat of the Year.
Genie was honoured for comforting her owner Evie Henderson, 11, from Lincoln, through six rounds of chemotherapy.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and said Genie's company helped her cope with several painful operations and long spells in hospital.
The cat was recognised by feline charity Cats Protection at a ceremony in London.

"I think she's great.
She deserves it.
She's always been there for me," said Evie.
"She would come round my leg with the plaster and she would sit by my feet.
She would smell my plaster and she'd come up on to the sofa and do pitter-patter on my knee.
When I've been too ill to have friends round or go outside and I've been stuck in the house, she'd come round me and that made me a lot happier and gave me great comfort."
Evie said she shared a special bond with her pet, which gave her tremendous support when she lost her hair while enduring the gruelling treatment.
"It was very upsetting for me because I had long brown hair.
But at the same time as it was spring, Genie was moulting as well so it was sort of like I'm losing my hair and Genie's losing her hair as well so that eased the shock of it all."
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said the cat had been a "great distraction" and described how Evie would watch video footage of her beloved pet from her hospital bed.
"Evie was in hospital for over 300 days so we spent a lot of time in hospital and it just gave her something to look forward to when she did have those few precious days at home."
The 11-year-old said: "I missed her every day I was in hospital, and my family could tell she missed me.
She's my best friend and I honestly don't know what I would do without her."
Report: Mueller Convenes Grand Jury in Russia Investigation
A grand jury has been impaneled by the special counsel investigating possible links between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The paper reports that the grand jury is a new and significant development in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether Trump or his top advisers colluded with Moscow to advance the Republican's presidential campaign in 2016.
NBC News has previously reported that before Mueller, the former FBI director now leading the probe, was appointed, federal prosecutors had convened grand juries as part of the investigations into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
John Dowd, one of the president's private lawyers, told NBC News he was not aware that Mueller had started using a grand jury.
"We have been cooperating with Bob Mueller and his staff since the first of June because we're trying to get this thing over and done with," he said.
"With respect to news of a federal grand jury being impaneled, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation."
NBC News has not independently verified the Journal report.
The use of a grand jury is part of the normal process of a complex investigation and it is a tool not just for hearing testimony but for learning about and obtaining records from individuals or companies.
It is a powerful tool prosecutors can use to seek indictments and subpoenas, and may be a signal Mueller's work is far from over.
Trump has denied that he or any members of his team colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Officials in Moscow have also denied playing a role in Trump's surprise victory last November.
Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn't aware that Mr. Mueller had started using a new grand jury.
"Grand jury matters are typically secret," Cobb said in a statement.
The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly.
The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.
Former FBI Director Jim Comey said three times the President is not under investigation and we have no reason to believe that has changed."
“Flying American” under a black sail
Of course I’ve heard of “flying” ships.
Who hasn’t?
Hydrofoils go back and forth several times a day between Tallinn and Helsinki.
It’s nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar launched the first foiling vessel, the Freccia d’Oro or Golden Arrow, in 1952.
The technology existed before that, but now there’s a wind-powered vessel before me.
A catamaran, yes, yet still a sailboat.
What formula makes it go airborne?
Let’s spare ourselves the formula (it isn’t hard to find) and take a layman’s glance at the concept of foiling.
What keeps aeroplanes aloft?
The wing’s shape is such that when the aircraft goes forward at high speed, the air flowing at different speeds below and above the wing creates aerodynamic lift. At a certain point, it exceeds the plane’s mass and the whole contraption becomes airborne.
Essentially the same process takes place in water.
A wing with the right shape creates lift as it moves along, and this in turn lifts the “winged” vessel out of the water.
Simple, right?
It gets complicated when we get to the mathematical part.
An aeroplane needs a minimum speed of 150-250 kph to take off, and the world record for the speed of a sailboat is currently “only” 121.1 km/h.
But let’s not get bogged down in high school physics!
Today we’ve come to look at a “flying” catamaran called the NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA is the acronym of “North American Catamaran Racing Association”.
FCS is an abbreviation for Flight Control System.
It’s a system that allows the crew to trim the vessel’s settings in mid-“flight” as well, and the 20 indicates the length of the sailboat in feet.
As soon as the catamaran emerges from under the covers, it’s clear this isn’t your Sunday driver’s sailboat.
Dr. Monocle and Captain Velvetvest remain on the pier.
No room for Piip and Prillid on board.
This here is hardcore.
This is Speed Cubed.
“Is this made of carbon fibre?” I ask, indicating the sail.
Yes, it’s all made of carbon fibre.
“The whole sail, then?” I ask, not quite comprehending.
“No, the whole boat,” comes the terse answer.
170 kg – the three of us embarking surely weigh more than 170 kg put together.
I compare everything – from detergent to afternoon snacks – to cars and this is no exception here – NACRA F20 is like a racer that’s not street legal.
A Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Built with a definite purpose in mind – to be driven in controlled conditions, and very, very fast.
Sailing hobbyists would be flabbergasted at the amount of safety equipment that has to be donned before putting out to sea.
Wetsuit, liner socks, special footwear with good traction, sailing gloves, harnesses, a special life vest, helmet.
Arrayed for battle, I feel that all I would need is an oxygen tank and I would be ready to go and colonize Mars, not just for putting out to sea.
“So is there a high probability of capsizing?” I ask in a jocular tone.
“Yes,” comes the brief reply.
“You’ve capsized a lot?” I continue probing.
Gotcha – this is not going to be a walk in the park.
I fasten my seat belt mentally.
Another thing that underscores the special nature of the craft is that to go out to sea, the Nacra F20 FCS needs an auxiliary boat next to it and at least two crew members.
The maximum is three, so there isn’t a lot of leeway.
It starts to dawn on me why this isn’t just a Sunday cruiser.
“Leili metsalood” (Leili’s forest tales) " Blog Archive " Land and road improvement works
Having once been in the profession myself, I inevitably take notice of any kind of land improvement work, whether taking place in the forest or fields.
The machinery and the quality of the work have improved significantly and now everything takes place with more energy than in the past.
Land improvement features from the past are now primarily being renovated, flaws and blockages are sought and fixed.
More stringent environmental requirements have come into effect, ones that were not given much attention decades ago.
The construction materials have been updated, now plastic pipes are used in building culverts instead of the reinforced concrete pipes of the past, and stones are complemented by textile – geotextile as it is called – for reinforcing the sides of ditches.
In the past, outlets and culverts were reinforced with precast concrete panels (of the MP or land improvement and the VKP or hydro construction variety) and sod.
For the purpose of environmental protection, before drainage waters (underground drains, ditches) reach natural streams and or rivers, sedimentation ponds are dug for collector ditches; these ponds should help clean the water of any fertilizers and toxic residues.
Often cat-tails are planted on the bottoms of the new settling ponds or basins or they start to grow spontaneously from airborne seed.
Cattails have the property of filtering toxic substances out of water.
The pond in the picture was dug last year and this year the soil at one end of the pond was levelled off, and a well for abstraction of firefighting was established using concrete ring installations.
To keep an errant vehicle from speeding into the pond, some larger chunks of rock were also transported to line the lot.
Besides cleaning ditches lining fields, the repair of forest roads is also under way.
The segment of forest road pictured should be part of the municipal road, which is also getting an additional gravel surface.
To the right is state forest, where the road being renovated continues to the right in front of the dump truck and which will soon be completed.
To the left is private forest.
The municipal road continues on and there the ditches along the fields and farming roads are being renovated and drainage flaws that have become evident are being fixed.
