She isn't a good cook. 
Tom said he isn't in any hurry. 
I know that Tom doesn't know anybody who does that 
I didn't know you weren't Canadians. 
Come to watch us play music sometime. 
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that. 
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today. 
Tom told me he'd complain about that. 
Tom's a member of my housing co-op. 
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see her. 
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that. 
You know as well as I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that. 
Tom wasn't sure whether he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't. 
I know that Tom might need to do that by himself. 
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing. 
It would've been tiring to do that. 
Tom must've told us the truth. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary ought to have done that. 
We will have to do something. 
When do you plan to do that? 
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week. 
Tom knew he'd be punished. 
I don't think I've ever seen anybody doing that before. 
That's not difficult. 
I'm afraid we don't have any left. 
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums. 
We have not yet succeeded. 
I've never been to Paris. 
Tom said he had eaten nothing, but that wasn't true. 
I'm an atheist. 
Tom said Mary was at home in bed with a cold. 
I wonder whether Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that. 
Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that on her own. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was puzzled. 
Tom said he'd be glad to do that for you. 
Tom said I looked a bit pale. 
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be confused. 
Tom thought Mary was alone. 
I know Tom is hiding something from me. 
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty year old? 
I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary wants to do that. 
I'm sure Tom will be back. 
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th. 
I know that Tom knows he doesn't have to do that. 
Why is everyone staring at us? 
I know that Tom didn't know who had done that to Mary. 
I reason that Tom did that was because everybody else in his family did. 
Everyone knows that I don't like Tom. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe. 
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you. 
I would've left early if I could've. 
I know that I have to do that before Tom gets here. 
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that. 
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet. 
I don't think Tom is handsome. 
Tom was the only one who was sleeping. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't asleep. 
I never should've let you go home alone last night. 
I think that I'm going to have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow. 
Tom said you were really good at tennis. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was autistic. 
Tom would've wanted to go to Boston with you. 
I know that Tom is a lot more creative than Mary is. 
I know that Tom is a lot more creative than I am. 
Tom said that he doesn't want to know why we did that. 
I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers. 
Tom said he's desperate. 
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon. 
Tom said it was a good time to leave. 
I know that Tom is frightened. 
You can't appreciate the poem until you have read it many times. 
I deliberately did that. 
Tom never should've left early. 
She is already married. 
This is blasphemy! 
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake. 
Tom said that he's glad he was able to do that. 
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars. 
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us? 
Tom said that he likes dancing with Mary. 
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that. 
Tom must've seen us doing that. 
I doubt that Tom will run for president. 
Tom should've done this yesterday. 
Tom may be angry. 
Tom said Mary won't be mad. 
I knew that Tom wanted us to do that for him. 
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore. 
I know that Tom knew he didn't need to do that. 
I hope I haven't forgotten anyone. 
Tom said that Mary knew that she might not need to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would be so angry. 
I thought you liked romance novels. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are bored. 
Tom has already been told about the problem. 
I know Tom was disobedient. 
I don't know anybody who hates Tom. 
Tom said he thinks I'd be able to win. 
Three years ago, I was in Boston. 
I don't think I could do what Tom is doing. 
Why doesn't anyone listen to me? 
Riches don't interest me. 
Tom said that he thought I seemed impressed. 
Tom said he had no objection to our leaving early. 
It isn't for beginners. 
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were depressed. 
I think Tom doesn't know how to swim. 
Tom has a lot of friends here. 
Tom knows he cheated. 
I think that Tom used to be a member of our club. 
Where is your notebook? 
I don't think I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today. 
It isn't likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong. 
How many kilometers is it from here to the railroad station? 
I don't think that story is true. 
He often adopts the behaviours and speech patterns that characterise the advantaged. 
Tom said you were his friend. 
I'm thinking of having dinner at six. 
Tom told Mary he'd be doing that tomorrow. 
I know Tom is through. 
Tom said Mary's dog bit him. 
Tom said he was through doing that. 
Tom said he's appealing his suspension. 
He is deeply attached to her. 
I thought you'd show me how to do that. 
I'm telling you we have to assume that Tom is dead. 
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment. 
Tom said Mary thought that she might be allowed to do that today. 
If you don't want to come, you don't have to. 
It smells like somebody has been smoking a cigar in here. 
We are just in time for the last train. 
I think that that question isn't appropriate. 
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid? 
I don't think anybody noticed what we were doing. 
What are we going to do? 
I could've cried. 
There's no free lunch. 
I thought that you said that we weren't going to go to Boston with Tom. 
Tom is quitting smoking. 
I think I know what Tom is doing here. 
Tom and Mary said they'd be glad to help. 
I'm now fairly certain that that's not going to happen. 
They're not as fussy as they used to be. 
We go to school every day except on Sundays. 
Tom told me that Mary wasn't hungry. 
Tom thought that he probably wasn't going to survive. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was bilingual. 
Tom said he thought he'd forgotten to lock the door. 
Tom told Mary that she should wash her car. 
They said that they didn't want to argue. 
Tom admitted he had done what he was accused of doing. 
Are you both Canadians? 
Why would anyone want to kiss Tom? 
I knew that Tom had never actually done that. 
They said that they had no other details. 
Tom thought that Mary liked me, but I knew that she hated me. 
Tom thinks I need to go. 
Tom told everybody that he didn't understand French. 
They said that they don't like to do that. 
Not everyone hugged Tom. 
Everybody needed to do that. 
I thought that Tom looked a little pale. 
I turned off the lights. 
She's a shopping addict. 
Tom said Mary was going back home to Australia. 
Tom told me he wasn't sleepy. 
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't. 
I thought that you said Tom was a barber. 
I wonder if this really works. 
Let's get to the point. 
Did you give the key to Tom? 
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she had to do that. 
My father is a doctor. 
I don't think I'd like being married to Tom. 
I didn't know you couldn't sing. 
Tom frequently does that by himself. 
I have learned a lot from this conversation. 
I thought Tom would buy that car. 
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now. 
Tom said that he was planning to stay at home all day. 
Tom should have apologized to Mary. 
Tom said he believed Mary. 
I'm afraid that I can't finish this report on time. 
Tom was about thirty years old when he moved to Boston. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that. 
Everybody here except Tom and Mary has done that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied. 
Tom said he was going to help us do that. 
Tom's house is very close to my house. 
The host cut the turkey for the guests. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that he doesn't really have to do that. 
I think that Tom will be able to understand that. 
I haven't decided yet. 
I know that that isn't worth doing. 
Tom told me he thought Mary had been rude. 
It's not wrong. 
Tom and Mary told me they felt offended. 
I'm very grateful to you. 
Tom's wicked. 
I knew that Tom wasn't as good a student as Mary. 
Mary told me that she was at home. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might want to do that. 
I know Tom is forgetful. 
Tom said Mary was mad. 
Tom says he's not guilty. 
Nobody laughed at Tom's joke. 
Tom said that's not his biggest problem. 
We're planning to go tomorrow. 
I think Tom snores louder than Mary. 
What are you trying to do? 
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not. 
Tom and Mary said they planned to go. 
You'd better take your shoes off. 
I didn't think we did anything wrong. 
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to do that. 
Tom has already decided that he's going to sign the contract. 
Is it true that you were there? 
What do you think Tom would've done? 
They say that they aren't coming. 
Tom said he was really glad he'd been asked to do that. 
I think Tom is likely to be there tonight. 
Tom said he might possibly do that. 
Tom told Mary he wouldn't ever do that again. 
I expect Tom is crying right now. 
You're really an angel! 
Tom has already decided that he's not going to try to escape. 
Tom told Mary that either he or she had to do that. 
Tom has already decided that he's not going to do that. 
Tom's a terrible joke teller, because he often forgets the punchline. 
Tom and I are both hungry. 
Tom and Mary say they won't do that for you. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was trustworthy. 
Tom said Mary is probably still scared. 
Tom and Mary said they did that on Monday. 
Tom doesn't know that I've never done that. 
Tom told me that I should go to Boston with Mary. 
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father. 
I know Tom is missing. 
I would've liked to do that. 
It won't be so hard to do that. 
Don't let Tom do that by himself. 
I was so excited! 
Tom is a party animal. 
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party. 
Tom will unlikely need to do that today. 
I hope I don't need to do that. 
Tom must've changed a lot. 
No one is better at this than me. 
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell that he was angry. 
I know that Tom knows that he shouldn't do that here. 
He is here. 
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now. 
My wife is also a scientist. 
I turned the computer off. 
Tom and Mary told me they weren't prepared. 
Tom said Mary is probably still mad. 
I'm quite sure Tom has relatives in Australia. 
Tom could have very easily waited for us. 
Tom told me he didn't need to use a wheelchair anymore. 
I thought that you said that you didn't do that. 
Tom said that he'd help me. 
I know that Tom isn't in bed yet. 
Tom said that he thought what Mary did was a mistake. 
They're not here. They went home. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't interested in sports. 
Tom wasn't impressed. 
Tom didn't realize that Mary didn't like him. 
Tom and Mary said that everybody they know can swim. 
I also don't think Tom is going to do that. 
Tom was the only one that knew what had happened to Mary. 
Where do you plan to do that? 
I didn't know you'd be through doing that by 2:30. 
Tom said he'd be thirteen next month. 
I wish I were by your side! 
Get your paws off of me. 
I'm afraid I have to refuse. 
I know you recently retired. 
I knew that Tom would be happy if you did that. 
I wonder whether we'll really do that today. 
Tom's sleeping. 
You are a good boy. 
I should've just walked right in. 
I don't think you've been listening to me. 
We are brother and sister. 
I don't think Tom is finished doing that. 
I don't think that we've done anything illegal. 
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before. 
Haven't you got a television? 
Don't give up! 
I don't play the mandolin as well as you. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that anymore. 
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me. 
The feeling is mutual. 
Tom has known Mary since he was a kid. 
Tom said he expects to do that on Monday. 
I don't think Tom knows that I love Mary. 
I think Tom will go to Boston next week. 
It isn't far away from the hotel. 
I have to find it. 
Tom said he didn't have many friends in Australia. 
Tom said Mary wasn't safe. 
Tom could've used the help. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be frightened by that. 
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was asking him for a divorce. 
Tom says that he's lonely. 
I knew Tom was a better student than Mary was. 
I am Jack. 
Tom and Mary said they'd be tempted to do that. 
Tom said that isn't the main reason why Mary has to do that. 
Tom said he plans on staying in Australia. 
After the rain, fair weather. 
I knew that Tom might want to learn how to do that. 
Tom and Mary say that they need to do that, too. 
I'm not married yet. 
Tom hasn't been told that he isn't required to do that yet. 
I suspect Tom will have to do that next week. 
I promised Tom I'd be there by 2:30. 
Winning is always hard. 
I am driving a truck. 
I'm certain that that's not the case. 
Tom had no idea that Mary was planning to stay in Boston for a few weeks. 
I love the fact Tom is back in Australia. 
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong. 
Tom said he'd probably do that the day after tomorrow. 
They said that they weren't unhappy. 
Tom said Mary isn't furious. 
I have not yet finished my supper. 
Tom didn't know that you would be there. 
I don't know if Tom and Mary plan to do that or not. 
I don't think Tom is still asleep. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that very well. 
I'm sure that Tom feels the same way that you do. 
Tom said he feels sick. 
Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that. 
I hope no one followed you. 
Tom knows he should've been able to do that better. 
I know Tom will be motivated to do that. 
Do you think we should've talked to Tom about this? 
Tom said he wished he hadn't given Mary any money. 
Tom may not be able to do that. 
I know you aren't enjoying yourself here. 
Kindergarten children act better than some adults. 
I thought that maybe we could travel together. 
I thought I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary is planning to do that. 
Tom wanted everybody to know he was unhappy. 
I know that Tom wanted me to do that. 
You look busy. 
Tom and Mary both looked at John. 
They think that they're stronger than me. 
I read this in the newspaper. 
How do I improve? 
Tom doesn't like doing that. 
They told me that they'd be discreet. 
I should've written it down. 
I'm no longer hungry. 
You can do it. 
Tom likes to keep things to himself. 
I don't think everybody has given up. 
I thought you had convinced Tom to help us. 
I'm sorry I couldn't come to Tom's funeral. 
I'm very happy. 
I know that Tom will be doing that today. 
I know that some of your students don't like you. 
Kyoko had the kindness to carry my baggage for me. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was hurt. 
Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that by himself. 
It's not very likely to rain tomorrow. 
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that next winter. 
I don't know what this means. 
I think it's more important to discuss possible solutions. 
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that. 
Do Tom and Mary both snore? 
It's way past the time Tom promised he'd be here. 
We are not going on vacation. 
I don't think I'll be able to do what I want to do. 
I think Tom is handling it well. 
Tom and I know that Mary wants to do that tomorrow. 
I don't think I can explain the difference. 
Tom said that he thought that it would be better if we didn't do that. 
I thought everyone here was a vegetarian. 
Tom said Mary didn't look happy to him. 
Nobody's perfect. 
I think Tom and Mary don't have children yet. 
I'm faster than you. 
Tom has a twisted sense of humour. 
I wish I were somebody else. 
I didn't know you were scared. 
I cried when Tom told me that he and Mary were getting divorced. 
I think Tom won't be cooperative. 
Tom and Mary took their shoes off. 
I wasn't really planning to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows that Mary has to do that. 
Tom said he doesn't mind buying that for you. 
Tom won't admit that he was wrong. 
Sorry, but I am unable to do so. 
Tom and Mary said it wasn't as difficult to do that as they expected. 
Tom told me that he was psyched. 
We should've brought lunch. 
The leading brand of pop drinks in most countries is Coca-Cola. 
Tom didn't have to stay home to help us. We could've done it by ourselves. 
I think Tom has already told us everything we need to know. 
I need to buy Tom some new clothes. 
I think going to Boston would be fun. 
Has anyone told Tom that he'll have to do that tomorrow? 
I think Tom should do that himself. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't given Mary his phone number. 
I knew Tom wouldn't want to go to Australia with Mary. 
You should tell Tom that you aren't planning to swim. 
Tom said we needed at least $300 to buy everything we needed. 
I know that Tom would do that by himself. 
I thought you were right. 
I think Tom will be discouraged. 
Tom said Mary was working in Australia. 
My father is not talkative. 
I know that Tom won't be forgiven for doing that. 
I sure hope that Tom gets here on time. 
Tom thought that Mary was just pretending to be happy. 
Do you promise that you won't tell Tom I gave you his phone number? 
I didn't know that you did that by yourselves. 
I think Tom could've solved that problem by himself. 
Tom said he'd likely do that. 
Tom told me he was headed home. 
Tom thinks that Mary won't be home on October 20th. 
I thought everyone was hungry. 
Tom said he would sort it out. 
I know that Tom is a strange guy. 
We might need to go to Australia next month. 
I always knew that Tom was destined for greatness. 
Did Tom happen to tell you how he plans to do that? 
Tom thinks Mary won't be the last one to do that. 
How dare you laugh at me! 
Tom and Mary say that they'd like to win. 
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is. 
Sport is good for your health. 
Tom said Mary was motivated to do that. 
I don't think that it's likely Tom will be here today. 
I thought that you said that you wanted Tom to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom will really do that today. 
I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that. 
Tom said he thought that he might be able win. 
Tom said that he's glad Mary was able to do that. 
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to fix Mary's car. 
Tom said he's quit drinking. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was mean. 
Are you positive Tom will do that? 
Tom said he didn't have much time left. 
Tom and Mary wondered why everyone was staring at them. 
Both Tom and Mary know that isn't likely to happen. 
Tom will stop Mary from doing that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was probably not having any fun doing that. 
I should've talked to Tom first. 
I don't think Tom knows how to play the cello. 
I think Tom might leave for Boston early tomorrow morning. 
Tom says he isn't planning to do that. 
Don't tell anybody where Tom is. 
Tom said that he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here. 
They promised that they'd do that. 
I didn't know that you could do that that well. 
I don't think Tom will be glad that that's going to happen. 
I think Tom could manage to do that alone. 
She is capable of anything. 
I thought that you said that we weren't going to sing. 
There is a dog! 
I thought that you said you could swim. 
I thought you said you were motivated to do that. 
Tom said he didn't need a break. 
Tom said he shot Mary in self-defense. 
I wish you had told me this earlier. 
Tom was surprised Mary wasn't able to dance very well. 
They told everybody they were tired. 
Tom was surprised when Mary told him she was only thirteen years old. 
I thought that you said you'd rather do that alone. 
Tom thinks that I need to sleep more. 
I thought that you said that you didn't see Tom this morning. 
Tom said he wasn't injured. 
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't happy. 
Tom phoned to say he's not coming. 
He is just an amateur. 
We are giving Tom a birthday party. 
They said that they think they can do that. 
I wonder whether I can do that again. 
I feel depressed often. 
Tom says he can't prove that Mary did that. 
Tom said that he thought he had to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom has done that already. 
You should've eaten some cake. 
Tom said he doesn't think you need to do that. 
Tom and Mary think they have the flu. 
Who told you we needed to do that? 
Tom said Mary has only done that once. 
I knew that Tom wasn't a very nice guy. 
Tom knew he should've done that by himself. 
What is cooking in the kitchen? 
I'm grateful for your help. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was interested in doing that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was odd. 
They're hiding. 
Tom realized that he wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf. 
I don't think Tom will do that with you. 
I am tired of homework. 
I don't think I'll dance with Tom. 
I think I should've asked for help. 
I didn't begin to study French until I was thirty. 
I think Tom is unbeatable. 
It should've been easy to accomplish. 
Tom knew Mary told everybody she wasn't going to go to Boston. 
It isn't necessary for you to be here any longer. 
Nobody seems to like Tom. 
Tom and Mary say that they can't believe anybody. 
No matter what Tom says, I plan to do that. 
I'm proud of you. 
It was clear that Tom had intended to do that yesterday. 
I think Tom wouldn't be in Australia now. 
I should've done that with Tom. 
I didn't think anybody was going to help you. 
Tom and Mary said that they were homeless. 
Earth is a planet. 
I think Tom would be skeptical. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was unbeatable. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be suspicious. 
I feel I could've done better. 
I thought Tom was kind of cute. 
Tom said he wasn't expecting any help from you. 
I thought that you said that I have to do that. 
When is Tom planning to eat? 
We now know that that isn't true. 
I don't think Tom sees it that way. 
Unfortunately, Apple doesn't provide a warranty for accidental damages. 
I think Tom likes doing that. 
She's the laziest person I know. 
Neither Tom nor Mary has done that yet. 
Don't talk nonsense! 
Tom said Mary wasn't scared. 
I should've helped you do that. 
Tom said that he'd give Mary a book. 
I think Tom can sing country music better than anyone else I know. 
Both Tom and Mary saw you. 
Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to do that. 
I don't know if Tom works there or not. 
There is no question about it. 
Nobody could solve the problem. 
I won't talk with him anymore. 
I think Tom is going to do that, too. 
I shouldn't have permitted you to do that. 
I've already met everybody. 
Tom said that Mary would do that, too. 
Tom said he hasn't done anything wrong. 
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't wait. 
I'm not convinced that I should do that. 
I think you should accept Tom's resignation. 
I didn't know that you were going to let Tom do that by himself. 
I know that Tom may want to do that. 
Tom said Mary didn't look like she was enjoying herself. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be asleep when he got home. 
Maybe Tom doesn't know that I hardly ever do that anymore. 
It's a deadly poison! 
They know that they're being watched. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary could speak French. 
Tom might be sleeping. 
I know that Tom isn't a very good manager. 
I don't care whether you do that or not. 
It's not rocket science. 
Tom said he wanted to help us. 
There's someone waiting for you. 
They said they were ready. 
Tom and Mary said they felt lightheaded. 
You know you shouldn't do that, don't you? 
Nothing has been done. 
Let's make sure that doesn't happen. 
I know that Tom knows why we couldn't do that for him. 
Tom said he thought that could happen in Boston, too. 
I didn't know Tom was an ancom. 
I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that. 
Tom said I was the one with the problem. 
You aren't expected to do that, are you? 
We'll climb the mountain if it is fine tomorrow. 
Nobody told Tom what he should do. 
Have you ever hit someone? 
I don't think Tom was mad. 
I knew that Tom knew how to do that. 
Tom and Mary told me they were healthy. 
I think that is wrong. 
There is a place for everything. 
Tom said he won't be allowed to do that anymore. 
I told Tom you were hungry. 
Tom is pretty sure that he saw a wolf. 
I don't think it's up to you to decide. 
I thought you were retired. 
Tom said he hopes that Mary won't do that by herself. 
They said that they had to work. 
My father will not be busy tomorrow. 
They told everyone that they were cold. 
Didn't you know that Tom isn't planning to do that? 
I was surprised when I heard that Tom had committed suicide. 
I know that Tom is a few years younger than I am. 
Tom told me that he was strong. 
Tom and Mary say that they can't wait that long. 
Tom thinks he should help Mary. 
I wonder whether Tom really told Mary she shouldn't do that. 
Tom won't let anyone except Mary drive his car. 
I don't think Tom knows why I wanted to do that. 
Nobody else was there. 
Tom told Mary he'd decided to stay for a few more days. 
I know that Tom wasn't the first one to do that. 
Tom said he didn't need to do that. 
I didn't think you'd do that by yourself. 
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone. 
I know that Tom isn't a bad person. 
It is said that he knows the secret. 
I think that Tom would be a good roommate. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might be required to do that. 
I know that Tom didn't know who had done that for him. 
Tom said he was well. 
Why didn't you tell me that you didn't want my help? 
Tom said he didn't think he could do that today. 
I just want you to consider the possibility that you are wrong. 
I'm certain I didn't say that. 
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels. 
I am as happy as can be. 
If they'd known what was about to happen, they would've changed their plans. 
I know that Tom didn't know that he didn't want to do that. 
Tom is rich, but he's not as rich as Mary. 
Go wake up Tom and tell him that breakfast is ready. 
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up. 
I should've left early. 
Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that by herself. 
Tom said his failure was due to bad luck. 
I didn't think Tom would be alone. 
Tom said he's not planning to buy anything. 
She has to be taken to hospital. 
Things didn't go the way I'd hoped. 
Tom said that he thought that he wouldn't get there until after dark. 
Tom said that Mary knew that he wanted to do that again. 
I know Tom is careless. 
Let me know if there is anything I can do. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't told Mary that he'd go to Australia with her. 
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time. 
Tom is not home right now. 
Tom said he likes to ski, too. 
I don't think there's any point in discussing this matter with you. 
I think that you shouldn't have done that by yourselves. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might not want to do that until it gets cooler. 
I didn't think Tom was annoyed. 
Tom said that he wasn't aware that Mary had done that. 
Tom said he's faster at doing that than Mary is. 
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot. 
I didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that by himself. 
We split up the loot three ways. 
I don't think Tom could do that by himself. 
Tom told me I was pretty. 
What time does the show start? 
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow. 
Tom won't likely go jogging with Mary. 
I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary. 
All three of my brothers are older than me. 
Tom said he didn't know if he'd be able to do that. 
I know that Tom wasn't able to do that. 
Keep left at the next traffic lights. 
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it. 
I think Tom loves Mary. 
Tom doesn't need Mary's help. 
Tom and Mary say that they're lonely. 
Were you afraid the first time you were on an airplane? 
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise. 
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize. 
I am disappointed in my son. 
I don't think I did very well. 
Do you think there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow? 
You know I don't have a car. 
There is a large supermarket. 
I suspected Tom was discouraged. 
I'm sure that Tom won't force anybody to do that. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that. 
I would've done the same thing Tom did. 
Are you sure that no one can see us? 
There's no solution to this problem. 
I heard Tom was in trouble. 
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow. 
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted. 
Has he been in touch with you? 
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon. 
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs. 
Today's the twentieth of October. 
Tom and Mary said they planned on going. 
I hope Tom saw what Mary did. 
I don't think that Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian. 
Africa is not a country. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me that he didn't have to do that. 
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that. 
I don't have kids. 
I know that Tom forgot to do that. 
I know you want to be happy. 
I think that book isn't so interesting. 
I was told that that's not a good idea. 
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that. 
I think our team is going to continue to get better. 
I wish somebody would help me with that. 
Tom definitely knows that he shouldn't be doing that. 
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves. 
I'm not sure Tom will be there. 
It is a big responsibility. 
I think that you should turn yourselves in. 
I wonder whether Tom enjoys doing that. 
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that. 
I should've known that I couldn't trust Tom. 
I didn't know that you and Tom worked together. 
Nobody will know that I'm here. 
I'm glad I left Australia. 
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise. 
Tom told me he'd try to do that. 
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that. 
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels. 
I knew that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that. 
Tom said he knew I might need to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary was sleeping. 
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back. 
Tom doesn't know that Mary is in love with someone else. 
I don't think Tom is concerned. 
I wish I had had the chance to learn French in high school. 
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that. 
I knew that Tom was going to be the one to do that. 
I thought Tom was still in jail. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself. 
Tom said he probably wouldn't win. 
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here. 
Do you think I'm weird? 
Tom thinks he knows it all. 
Tom said it's not going to end well. 
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today. 
I thought we had something to give to Tom. 
The pupils did the work themselves. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that. 
You will remain here until you are summoned. 
My daughter is being toilet trained. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary could've done that. 
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine. 
They said that they isn't ready to go. 
Something's happened to him. 
Nobody suspected anything like this. 
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said. 
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other. 
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you. 
I think that Tom is a pretty good painter. 
I know that Tom is a picky eater and seldom tries anything new. 
Tom says he did nothing illegal. 
I suspect that Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore. 
I know Tom doesn't love me. 
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that. 
Look at this high mountain. 
She's still chatting away. 
You're a nerd. 
Everybody was late except me. 
He could not resist the temptation. 
Tom will likely get angry if you do that. 
I assumed Tom would agree to do that. 
I'm a libertarian. 
May I ask Tom to help me? 
I wonder whether Tom could help us. 
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you. 
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today. 
I don't think that Tom will have to do that alone. 
She wants to know who sent the flowers. 
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be. 
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia. 
Tom admitted that he'd been rude. 
You'll have a hard time. 
I should've let Tom talk to you first. 
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand. 
I didn't think we should be talking about that. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would let me do that. 
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there? 
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary is. 
Tom didn't know somebody had been hired to kill him. 
Tom told me that he can't eat peanuts. 
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that. 
Tom said he thought I might not need to do that. 
Shut up and listen to me. 
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that. 
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that. 
Am I the only one who's confused? 
I know that Tom is a bully. 
He is a most clever boy. 
How is your dad? 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't sleeping. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was home. 
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous. 
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant. 
It won't be hard for us to do that. 
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him. 
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't planning on going anymore. 
I think Tom has a plan. 
It's not what it seems. 
They said that they felt comfortable. 
Tom said he had never planned on living in Australia for so long. 
Tom told me he didn't actually want to go to Boston. 
Tom has a lot more books than you do. 
I know Tom is about the same height as you are. 
There is no excuse for his delay. 
Tom must've been the one who put the drugs in my bag. 
Tom said that he's glad that Mary wasn't hurt. 
Tom asked Mary whether she'd read the book that he'd lent her. 
I woke up at seven o'clock. 
I could've done that, but I didn't. 
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they're getting married. 
They said that they planned on going Monday. 
It's not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house. 
Don't speak so fast, please. 
They told me that they had bacon and eggs for breakfast. 
Tom didn't tell anyone that they had to do that. 
I think Tom paid way too much for that old saxophone. 
Tom said he was all worn out. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was busy. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that. 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was finished. 
I thought you had to work. 
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed. 
You should've stayed where you were. 
I'll miss you. 
You never told me you didn't like Australia. 
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic. 
Tom says that he can wait, but Mary can't. 
Tom could've kicked himself. 
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework. 
Tom must be right. 
You knew that I was the only one who could do that, didn't you? 
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that without our help. 
Tom thinks Mary isn't awake. 
Did anyone else hug Tom? 
Tom told me he liked my idea. 
I know you're just doing that to annoy me. 
That's a mistake. 
One way is not better than the other. 
What's wrong with me? 
Is anybody afraid? 
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to. 
We married seven years ago. 
I could've done that better than Tom did. 
I don't think we're ready to do that yet. 
I thought we were friends. 
Please, don't be angry with me! 
I don't think Tom could've done that any better. 
I know Tom didn't do that correctly. 
She is in a bad mood. 
I didn't think Tom would cry. 
Tom thinks Mary is better at French than she really is. 
Tonight I'm free. 
Do you think Tom would've done that? 
That is his house. 
I am at home. 
You need not pay for your lunch. 
Maybe I should've tried harder. 
I thought Tom was going to do that today. 
They promised that they'd check on it. 
I'm sure Tom would've agreed. 
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that. 
Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that by himself. 
I know I'm in trouble now. 
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters. 
Tom must've put up a fight. 
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia. 
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt. 
Tom said that he was glad that you'd done that. 
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker. 
Well I never! 
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win. 
I am a student, but he isn't. 
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary planned to do. 
I wonder whether Tom is really homesick. 
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was good at French. 
Tom says that he'll always love Mary. 
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do. 
I wish I were someone else. 
I thought Tom had already done his homework. 
Tom isn't busy. 
I just wanted you to know I support you. 
Tom said he knew the area well. 
We are all in grave danger. 
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks? 
I have just hard-boiled an egg for myself. 
Have you got a pen with you? 
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer. 
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for $300. 
They said that they like this time of year. 
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him. 
They say that they declined that deal. 
I know that Tom didn't know that you couldn't do that. 
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks. 
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted. 
I know that Tom is a really close friend of Mary's. 
I know that Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that. 
Tom thinks that we can take care of ourselves. 
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that? 
I know that Tom would unlikely agree to do that. 
Tom shut down his computer. 
I don't think Tom knows what time it is. 
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help. 
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans on doing that. 
Tom could've asked me first. 
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you? 
I didn't do that as soon as I should've. 
I don't think Tom is bossy. 
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia? 
I don't think Tom will give you the keys. 
I wonder if Tom has ever asked Mary why she didn't do that. 
I would've done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me. 
Tom said he wanted to change his plans. 
How do you tell someone that? 
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry. 
I thought Tom already knew that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that. 
Tom and Mary swore that they'd never hit me again. 
Tom said he should've stayed in Australia longer. 
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school. 
I know I can do this. 
I don't think I should've left before Tom. 
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore. 
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know. 
Tell them I'll come. 
His face turned white. 
I thought I heard something. 
I've already told Tom I need to do that. 
I plan to stay at home all day Monday. 
I'd rather do this alone. 
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace. 
I don't think we're ready. 
No one contradicted Tom. 
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom? 
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on? 
We have not yet begun to fight. 
Who is knocking on the door? 
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that. 
They said that they're supportive. 
I thought that would be a great idea. 
What you said shocked everyone. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were ambidextrous. 
Tom said that he thought that what Mary did was a mistake. 
I hope no one comes. 
I thought that everyone could do that. 
I think we'll be back soon. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was in her bedroom studying. 
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone. 
Everything's going to be OK. 
Tom told me that it didn't matter. 
I know that Tom wanted Mary to do that. 
I'm twelve. 
I'd forgotten about that. 
Tom told everybody that he was through doing that. 
They figured there was no hope. 
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again. 
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pleased. 
I thought that you said that you were glad you didn't do that. 
Tom can speak French a little. 
I know that Tom is a lot taller than I me. 
I thought that's what you wanted. 
I can't guarantee that that's going to happen. 
I knew that Tom wasn't very busy. 
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary. 
I know Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again. 
You're not worried about the test, are you? 
Tom said he was willing to help me do that. 
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not. 
Everybody's having a good time. 
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did. 
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that. 
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush. 
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice. 
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that. 
Tom thought it was difficult. 
We have walked all around the lake. 
I don't think that it's going to be difficult to convince Tom. 
They said that they didn't work on Mondays. 
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is. 
You will do no such thing. 
You're so hot! 
Tom would've been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year. 
They said that they were very mad. 
I know that Tom knows that I want to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom is safe. 
I know that Tom didn't know that he shouldn't be doing that here. 
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer? 
I haven't done that yet. 
Tom said he felt like doing that. 
I don't understand how this could have happened. 
You are as tall as my sister. 
Tom has read a lot of books about that. 
I think Tom has already done enough. 
Do you know anybody in Boston? 
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do. 
Someone told Tom the truth. 
I thought you'd be happy to see me. 
Tom admitted that he was the one who had stolen Mary's money. 
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that. 
We better tell the others. 
Why's everybody talking about Tom? 
Federer held at love at 2-2. 
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to. 
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself. 
Tom said that he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together. 
I said nothing, and that made him angry. 
When will he be finished? 
You are a very naughty boy. 
Tom plans on doing that in the near future. 
We are late. 
You aren't the only one who knows what's going on, are you? 
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth. 
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that. 
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary could do that or not. 
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have e-mail. 
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. 
Tom said that he hopes that you won't want to do that. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't been there. 
I thought that you said you wanted to go with us. 
I know you're not happy. 
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry. 
We might need to be in Australia for several weeks. 
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to. 
I don't think Tom knows anybody who is able to do that. 
Tom said he expected Mary to participate. 
I swim every day. 
Who is the lucky guy? 
They pretended that they didn't know me. 
I know that Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is. 
Tom will do that if no one stops him. 
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that. 
I'm sure you will succeed. 
You know Tom and I aren't going to do that, don't you? 
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30. 
I'm sure we should've turned left back there. 
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish. 
I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that. 
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something. 
She does not like snakes and mathematics. 
I knew that Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway. 
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment. 
I knew that Tom knew who needed to do that. 
I don't think you should drive. 
Let's hope that changes today. 
It's not fair at all. 
That is not exactly what I said. 
They put their books down. 
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am. 
I thought you loved Tom. 
That isn't feasible with current technology. 
They said that they tries to be optimistic. 
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French. 
I wonder whether Tom has already told Mary not to do that. 
I don't think that Tom needs to do that by himself. 
Tom and Mary said they're sick. 
Tom said he isn't allowed to do that. 
I assume you're going somewhere with this. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was thirty. 
You have a sense of humour. I like that. 
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that. 
It's not something I want to discuss. 
I think that Tom will refuse to do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they needed my help. 
I think she's over 40 years old. 
Can you cook an omelette? 
Tom said that he knew I was coming. 
No one asked you to come here. 
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night. 
We hope that you'll be in Boston next spring. 
You know I won't say anything. 
I will do it tomorrow. 
I can't walk any more. 
I wonder whether we could do anything to help. 
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that. 
I don't think Tom is capable of that. 
Tom didn't know that he had to do that by himself. 
Tom is dating a girl who's three years younger than he is. 
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that. 
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
I know that Tom would be interested in doing that. 
I think Tom will like this wine. 
I believe we spoke on the phone. 
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that. 
There is a certain amount of truth in what he's saying. 
Tom said he wanted to write a book. 
I don't think that Tom is a slob. 
He is not a virtuoso. 
I suspect Tom lied to me. 
Tom eventually will need to do that. 
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30. 
Tom hasn't yet told Mary what he has to do. 
I know that Tom is a good diver. 
It isn't easy for me to trust anyone. 
I knew I should've stayed home. 
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us. 
He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer. 
Tom said he plans to be a doctor. 
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here. 
A wolf cannot be tamed. 
I think Tom might be older than me. 
I don't think that's correct. 
I'm not gonna do anything about it. 
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong. 
Tom didn't know what he should've been doing. 
Tom said I should study harder. 
They say that they'll hurt me. 
I know Tom might be tempted to do that. 
I'm not sure I can win this. 
I'm afraid you won't get paid. 
Are you worried that that might happen? 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary did that. 
Do not forget to take your umbrella when you leave here. 
I'll see to it that that gets done. 
I wear a suit but wear no tie. 
I am as tired as you. 
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold. 
I think Tom hates waiting for me. 
I should've apologized right away. 
You're lucky you didn't get injured. 
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live? 
This tree is more than a century old. 
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad. 
I don't think that that was the right thing to do. 
Are you certain Tom will do that? 
We cannot live without air. 
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary. 
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia. 
Tom told me he wasn't nervous. 
Tom knows something we don't. 
Tom said he was worried about Mary. 
All of us got into the car. 
I wonder whether Tom likes to do that or not. 
Last night I puked. 
Tom isn't very good at bowling. 
Tom said Mary gave him something. 
Give me some water. 
Tom said he wants to write a book. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary would be mad. 
I don't think you've been paying attention. 
We will need more time. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing. 
Tom said Mary is going to do that tomorrow. 
You are both welcome to come with us. 
I can't believe that Tom is actually doing that. 
It's not something anyone can do. 
Tom said he ate too much. 
We are all looking forward to your coming. 
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon. 
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom? 
I began studying French when I was thirteen years old. 
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary. 
I know that Tom will likely give you permission to do that. 
Is it OK if I ask Tom to help me? 
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by himself. 
I wonder if Tom is motivated. 
Tom said he would've done that if he'd thought it was necessary. 
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that. 
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that. 
I still wish you'd do that. 
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning to stay very long. 
I didn't know you were going to be jealous. 
Tom didn't know that Mary had children. 
They say that they can't wait that long. 
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that. 
Tom might be lonely. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't very busy. 
I'm absolutely certain that's not going to happen. 
I think he is right. 
Tom said that he was glad you did that for Mary. 
I think that Tom knew where Mary was going to do that. 
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that. 
You're very annoying. 
I have already finished reading this book. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher. 
I didn't know you were rich. 
I should've told Tom to stay in Boston. 
You have finished your homework, haven't you? 
What could've happened? 
I don't think that Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not. 
I got lost in the forest. 
I know that Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band. 
Tom told me that he'll be in Boston next Monday. 
Keep your mouth shut! 
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday. 
Tom said he regretted what had happened. 
It is never too late to learn. 
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do that. 
Tom knew Mary was sick. 
Have you got a pen on you? 
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do. 
I'll wait until 2:30. 
My parents won't allow me to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows how much time it'll take for him to do that. 
I don't think I want to do that here. 
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked? 
I know that you're afraid of Tom. 
Tom tried on his father's clothes.

Tom thinks Mary won't ever come back. 
Tom said that he thought that wasn't going to happen. 
I don't think that Tom knows that I love him. 
It's going to be hard to do that now. 
Tomorrow's a new day. 
I knew that Tom didn't need to do that alone. 
I know I didn't make the right choice. 
Tom didn't give me everything he promised. 
You knew that Tom told everyone he wasn't going to do that, didn't you? 
Tom said he needed money to buy something to eat. 
I think Tom would be happy if you did that. 
Wish me luck. 
They said that they called the police. 
It's raining cats and dogs. 
Tom said Mary thought John might have to do that. 
I should've gone there by myself. 
Go back home. 
Tom said that he thought he knew what needed to be done. 
No one I know has done that. 
I didn't think Tom would say that to Mary. 
I don't think this is the time or place to discuss this. 
Tom thought that Mary didn't drive a car. 
I am not a fan of libertarianism. 
I know that Tom isn't going to help Mary do that. 
I wonder whether Tom wants me to do that today. 
Tom said that he knew that I was coming. 
As far as I know, it's the first time Tom has ever done that. 
I know that that's not enough. 
Tom has already decided that he isn't going to buy one. 
I suspected Tom was homesick. 
I'm travelling alone. 
Tom knew that Mary used to be a teacher. 
Tom said no one else wanted to do that. 
It's not that long a flight. 
Tom and Mary say that they did that for the money. 
They told me that they like you a lot. 
I'm not sure that's a good idea. 
Tom said he didn't like living downtown. 
Tom is now living by himself. 
Tom said that he thought Mary enjoyed the party. 
They're not where they want to be. 
I'm fairly certain that Tom will pass today's exam. 
I think Tom is probably better at French than you think he is. 
Then they played "ring-a-ring-a-rosy" until they were tired and thirsty. 
We hope that that happens sooner rather than later. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me that he didn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he thought he had to study French. 
I wonder if there's a chance Tom will be here tomorrow. 
I wonder whether Tom can babysit for us tonight. 
Tom admitted that he didn't win. 
Tom will need more money than that. 
I think Tom should buy some new clothes. 
Tom says he hopes Mary knows she doesn't have to do that. 
It'll be impossible to do that. 
I know that Tom is afraid that he might hurt Mary's feelings. 
I know that Tom wasn't planning to do that. 
I doubt that Tom will be able to seal the deal. 
I thought you'd be through doing that by 2:30. 
If you'd helped me, I would've succeeded. 
I know that Tom is courageous. 
Can someone give us a lift? 
They didn't think that they would make it. 
Tom said that he doesn't think you can do that. 
Tom and Mary said they're glad they could do that. 
What makes you think that Tom and Mary are planning on resigning? 
Tom said Mary was good at speaking French. 
Tom's parents let him do what he wants. 
I think you should know I won't do that for you. 
You already know that Tom isn't going to do that, don't you? 
I thought it was an earthquake. 
I would do anything to help you both. 
They said that they're not going to do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was adopted. 
There are colapsible solar cockers. 
Tom said he might walk to work tomorrow. 
You got any grapes? 
I know that Tom knew that I needed to do that. 
There's no use crying over spilt milk. 
I know that Tom is crazy. 
Tom said he'd let me know if anything happened. 
Tom already knows that we want to quit your job. 
Look at that boy who is swimming. 
It's not something I think I can do. 
I should've been the first one to do that. 
Why did you tell Tom I planned to wait until Monday to do that? 
Tom knows that you did something bad. 
I don't think Tom will be at today's meeting. 
I think Tom does that better than Mary does. 
I think Tom and Mary both want to go to Boston. 
I hope that you and Tom get along. 
I know that Tom is more handsome than I. 
I know that Tom didn't know that I don't often do that. 
They promised that they'd win. 
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling dizzy. 
Tom said Mary thought she might not be required to do that by herself. 
Go to your room. 
I wonder whether or not Tom knows Mary's phone number. 
Tom and Mary said that they were confused. 
I illuminate myself with immensity. 
I know you're going to come back. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was broke. 
I wish that I could've helped you more. 
I knew that Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to. 
I know that Tom isn't a very creative person. 
I also plan to do that. 
Tom told everybody that he was afraid. 
The police said we had to leave. 
Tom said I should've left early. 
I don't think I'm very petty. 
Close your books! 
I wonder whether there's a chance Tom will help us. 
What are some foods commonly eaten in America? 
Tom told me he'd be here. 
I thought I'd be finished doing that by 2:30. 
I know that Tom knows that Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom was done doing that before anybody got here. 
Tom may be wrong. 
You're not Tom, are you? 
I know that Tom doesn't know how Mary managed to do that. 
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. 
You're not responsible for Tom anymore. 
I think Tom and Mary both are stuck-up. 
I know you're having trouble in French class. 
Who told you I was going to do that? 
Tom said nothing would make him happier than to spend the summer in Australia with his grandparents. 
I didn't know that you were planning to do that before you went home today. 
Did you know Tom has served time in prison? 
I'll eat the same thing you eat. 
Tom said he's not permitted to do that. 
It is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes. 
Tom said he knew you wouldn't win. 
Do you promise that you won't tell Tom I gave you his phone number? 
Tom didn't know that you used to live in Boston. 
Tom might know why Mary wants to do that. 
I thought Tom was Canadian. 
I hope someone will do that for us. 
Everyone knows that it worked. 
I don't think it'll happen. 
I know that I can be replaced. 
Tom said he doesn't do that anymore. 
Do you eat out often? 
I can't believe you didn't recognize me! 
I think that you're going to enjoy yourselves tonight. 
It doesn't mean anything! 
Tom said that he thought that I wanted to do that. 
They told me that they were pessimistic. 
I don't understand how I could've made such a mistake. 
My brother is now in Australia. 
I can't stand this noise any longer. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do that again. 
I don't think that was what Tom said. 
I don't think that Tom is as influential as Mary. 
I have made up my mind to work harder. 
I'm going to work. 
Tom said he's unbiased. 
What's it for? 
I'm pretty sure Tom will do that. 
Tom said he thought I was being stubborn. 
A Chabad rabbi, Abraham Chen, saw Peter Kropotkin as a tsadik.

Tom is a lot faster at doing that than Mary. 
Tom didn't think he'd ever have a chance to live in another country. 
Tom and Mary claimed that they'd seen a UFO. 
Tom should've done that years ago. 
You didn't know Tom had never done that before, did you? 
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult to do that than they thought it would be. 
Tom said that he knew Mary couldn't win. 
I thought that you said that you didn't know anybody in Boston. 
This house is not for sale. 
I knew that Tom would want to go to Australia with me. 
I'm fairly certain that's what's going to happen. 
I haven't finished doing that yet. 
Stay out of it! 
Tom knows that I'm not afraid of anyone. 
I don't think Tom knows who's going to do that with him. 
I love Norwegian! 
I know that Tom didn't know that we shouldn't have done that. 
I know you don't like chocolate. 
I don't think I'll go to Boston this year. 
I'm sure you would've done the same for me. 
Tom wanted everybody to know that he was unhappy. 
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape. 
They deny that they paid ransom money. 
I want you to find out if Tom is planning to come here by himself. 
I hope that I will be able to help you at some other time. 
They said that they figured I could do that. 
We both know that that's not true. 
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was still up. 
They say that they might go shopping. 
Tom told me he thought his house was haunted. 
It's not likely to be as easy as you think it'll be. 
They realized that they'd been unreasonable. 
Tom told Mary that he was thirsty. 
They know that they messed up. 
Tom thinks Mary would be amused by what's going on. 
I suspect Tom was there. 
Tom said that Mary thought she might be required to do that by herself. 
They told me that they losing weight. 
There is a lot that is happening right now. 
Tom said Mary snored. 
Tom said he wouldn't do that today. 
I don't think Tom is tempted to do that. 
Tom told us he thought that he could become a famous singer. 
Tom admitted that he had lied to Mary. 
I know Tom will probably have to do that. 
I don't think you'll have the time to do that today. 
That happens sometimes. 
I thought we could get together later. 
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to tell Mary she needs to do that. 
I think I have a good chance of winning the election. 
Who is coming? 
Tom must've practiced that a lot. 
Tom said that he'd call you later. 
I knew that what I was doing was wrong, but I did it anyway. 
They said that they isn't sure. 
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to go with us. 
Tom said he was very happy. 
Tom said he'd complain. 
I think that there still is a chance that that'll happen. 
I thought doing that would be a waste of time. 
I'm fairly certain that's not going to happen. 
I thought you were used to living in a trailer. 
I didn't think that Tom would tell anyone. 
They said that they'll buy that for you. 
I knew we should've stayed in Australia. 
They said that they intended to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom ever gives Mary flowers. 
I hope that Tom wasn't injured in the crash. 
No, it's not easy. 
I know that Tom is tall. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was here. 
I don't think Tom did anything with it. 
I assume that was a rhetorical question. 
Tom jumped out of bed. 
What's the best way to get in touch with you? 
What colour is this cat? 
It's not a cat. It's a dog.

I don't think it's right. 
I don't have to do anything I don't want to. 
Tom and Mary weren't planning to do that until John asked them to. 
If you'd left home a little earlier you would've been on time. 
You cannot be too careful when driving. 
Tom said Mary thought he might want to do that this evening. 
Tell Tom I'm coming. 
I would've bought more clothes if I had had the money. 
I thought I told you not to talk to my daughter. 
Tom and Mary told me that they've just done that. 
What're the chances Tom will win? 
I'm afraid you can't. 
I think Tom won't be gone by the time we get there. 
Tom said he plans on staying in Boston. 
I don't think you have a choice. 
She likes to run. 
They said that they'd leave. 
Tom said he needed to do that before Mary got here. 
That's not what I'm going to talk about. 
Both Tom and John say they've kissed Mary. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was ready. 
I know I've been lied to. 
Tom is the one that's going to be punished. 
It is a pity that you can't join us. 
I know I'm supposed to do this. 
I can't believe you did this. 
Tom said he wanted to help. 
Why does everybody think Tom and I are stupid? 
What are the positive sides? 
The battery indicator light is showing that the battery is not getting charged.

My dream has come true.

Tom never seems to wait for anyone. 
Tom said he didn't like the taste of beer. 
I don't think people should do that. 
I think this is a serious matter. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary really needs to do that. 
Tom taught French to his friends. 
I thought Tom might not be permitted to do that today. 
Mr Yoshida is at home in French history. 
I should've never left early. 
Are you exhausted? 
I left as soon as I was asked. 
I don't have anything to do! 
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key. 
I don't think I'm being unreasonable. 
Tom and Mary said everybody they know has been to Boston. 
They told us they could speak French. 
You are deceiving yourself. 
We talked to everyone. 
Tom said Mary is probably still troubled by what happened. 
I assume you'll not come to work tomorrow.

I would've never thought of that. 
I think Tom is unbiased. 
I would've done that by myself if Tom hadn't been there. 
I already knew that Tom was planning on doing that. 
Stop treating me like a kid. 
Tom said that he thought that I seemed impressed. 
You didn't know that you wouldn't be able to do that, did you? 
Tom's interested. 
I'm sure Tom will do that. 
I know that Tom is in his bedroom sound asleep. 
I know that Tom knows that I hardly ever do that. 
I think Tom will be furious. 
Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that by himself.

I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to work together. 
I wish I could've done it by myself. 
I need a little help. 
I have serious doubts about their plans succeeding. 
You could've saved me a trip if you'd just told me I didn't need to be here today. 
They said that they're curious. 
Tom could lend money to Mary.

I don't think that I know the boy that's sitting over there. 
Tom knows better than to walk home alone after dark. 
I thought we could talk about anything. 
Tom will unlikely want to do that. 
That would be cool. 
I know that that isn't enough.

This book is new.

We will attack at sunrise. 
I don't think Tom knows all the rules yet. 
I know that Tom is a better person than I'll ever be. 
I think that Tom might've joined a cult. 
I am invited to this party. 
It was clear that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she didn't need to do that. 
My name is unimportant. 
Tom thought Mary taught French. 
I don't think that Tom knows I'm not single anymore. 
Is it OK if I sit here? 
Nothing is as important as peace. 
I thought that we'd get there on time, but we didn't. 
Tom assumed everybody knew that Mary was going to do that. 
What are you going to do with that? 
I thought that you said that you wanted to do that this morning. 
I thought I'd be doing that by myself. 
I realized that Tom wasn't joking. 
There's no chance that Tom will forget to do that. 
Tom didn't think Mary was the one who did that. 
Prepare to die. 
Tom said he was very tired. 
Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary hadn't yet done that. 
It's been done before. 
I don't think we're going to be able to be at your party tonight. 
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help.

I'm sure Tom will go to Australia. 
Are Tom and Mary planning to do that anytime soon? 
I'm glad I didn't buy one of those. 
I thought you ought to know.

It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone. 
Even if it rains, I plan to do that. 
Do you think Tom would've helped us? 
Tom said he wanted to buy another car.

Mercury is the planet nearest to the sun.

Tom called and said that he was coming. 
Tom said that he's glad that Mary didn't get hurt. 
I thought that you said you couldn't draw. 
I wonder whether Tom wanted to go to Boston with Mary. 
It must have been difficult for Tom to do that. 
Mary's got everything she needs, with one exception: Tom. She really misses him. 
Tom said that he thought that I should get more exercise. 
That's not the way I would've done that. 
I didn't know that Tom would be there. 
I thought the ending was perfect. 
I wonder whether Tom really wanted to go to Boston with Mary. 
I can't really be sure that Tom wasn't the one who stole the money. 
It's what Tom would've wanted. 
I know that Tom isn't much taller than Mary is. 
Tom has already decided that he isn't going to try to escape. 
I know you and Tom skipped school yesterday. 
No one said doing that would be easy.

You said you'd help me. 
Mary says she doesn't plan on going there by herself. 
I only hope it is not too late. 
I don't think Tom is going to win.

Everybody but Tom knew that Mary was in love with him. 
Tom said he knew that Mary needed to do that. 
I thought you would end up married to Tom. 
They said that they planned on going. 
I heard Tom is going to Australia. 
I know I'm better than this. 
Tom and Mary say that they've never been arrested. 
What you are doing is now far more dangerous than what Tom did. 
Tom said he'd try to keep Mary from doing that. 
Tom didn't want to wake up the kids. 
I didn't think Tom would forget that. 
Tom said he knew he might need to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows what he's gotten himself into. 
How did Tom find out that we'd be here? 
Without Tom's advice, Mary would have failed. 
Who is he? 
I want that doll. 
Tom said he didn't want to work as a waiter. 
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived. 
I am very grateful to you for your help.

Where's the entrance to the underground car park? 
They say that they'll pay for everything. 
Tom said that he assumed you would do that. 
They are fascinated by blood and violence. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this. 
No one knows exactly where Tom will go. 
You should make sure that you don't make Tom angry. 
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves. 
Some think it is a bad idea. 
How do I know that you're not going to try to kill me? 
I wonder whether Tom really went to Boston. 
Tom said he considered doing that. 
I don't think Tom will be by himself. 
I cannot figure out why he has done that. 
Tom didn't know why Mary was so angry. 
Tom said Mary was likely to be out. 
Why don't you put some clothes on? 
That wasn't the main reason Tom shouldn't have done that. 
Tom says that he's sorry that he broke his promise. 
It's not safe to text while you drive. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't concerned. 
Tom and Mary say they're almost ready to leave. 
Aren't you getting in? 
Tom and Mary say they'd rather go home. 
Tom said that he knew that was what Mary ought to do. 
Tom said he's been waiting for over three hours. 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be prudent. 
Tom said he was hoping to see you. 
I think Tom is responsible. 
My mother died on the same day I got married. 
Some people believe that seven is a lucky number. 
Tom called Mary to tell her that he thought she should stay in Boston for another three weeks. 
I am learning Quechua. 
It is Friday. 
What's for dinner tonight? 
Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John can take care of himself. 
I think that Tom is out on the porch talking to Mary. 
I'm about the same age as you are. 
Tom said Mary didn't seem angry. 
We are changing our clothes. 
Tom knows that Mary should do that. 
You knew that Tom was a ballet dancer, didn't you? 
Tom said he needed to get more sleep. 
I think Tom knows why. 
It's not like I don't want to do it. 
I do not like cats and my brother does not either. 
Tom is obviously very rich. 
You never know what will happen tomorrow. 
Tom said that he thought he might be the only one who needs to do that. 
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that. 
I figured it had to be good. 
It might be good to do that. 
I thought Tom had seen me. 
If I'd known Tom's address, I would've written to him. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was amused. 
Tom thought Mary was charming. 
Someone should've told Tom that he was doing that the wrong way. 
I knew that Tom shouldn't go outside. 
Do you have vegetarian pilaf? 
I know you need to go to Boston. 
I knew that Tom was a bum. 
I have got a question. 
Tom takes a shower every morning. 
Tom said that Mary knew she might have to do that. 
I think Tom could be just the person we need. 
This isn't at all surprising. 
I know that Tom knows he's not supposed to do that. 
I thought Tom would know how to do that. 
I think Tom is doing that, too. 
Tom said he heard somebody snoring. 
I doubt very seriously that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that. 
Tom knows time's running out. 
I think that it was Tom's mistake. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was having a good time in Australia. 
Tom says he's planning on going to Australia with Mary. 
Tom said he wasn't likely to cry. 
It's usually easy for Norwegians to get what Swedes are saying. 
They told me that they didn't know. 
I don't like this store. 
Do you think there's any chance you can do that? 
Tom didn't know that what he did was wrong. 
I didn't know that Tom had already gone home. 
Tom said Mary would help him, but I didn't think she would. 
Tom said Mary should've walked away. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was being truthful. 
I don't think you'll have the same problems I had. 
This book is worth reading twice. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be ready to do that. 
I wish that had happened. 
It isn't going to hurt. 
I don't think I can do that right now. 
You look like you're not having any fun. 
I thought that you wanted to go to Australia. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was lost. 
Tom said he was unable to do everything he had planned to do. 
Tom said he didn't want to give a speech. 
I assume we're doing a pretty good job since no one has complained. 
Tom knows he isn't welcome here. 
Tom said he'd visit Mary in Boston every weekend. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was insane. 
Did you know that Tom had only one leg? 
I think Tom is talking to Mary about that right now. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary should've done that. 
I knew that Tom was a better cook than me. 
Tom knows I borrowed the money from Mary. 
Tom said that he thought it would be better if I didn't do that. 
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy. 
Tom and Mary told me that they had bacon and eggs for breakfast. 
I know that Tom knows Mary didn't want to do that. 
I hope I don't say anything stupid. 
I'm sorry I took so long. 
Tom is going to be very sorry he didn't do that. 
They let me know that they wouldn't do that. 
I'm sorry that I can't come today. 
Both Tom and Mary are scared. 
I thought Tom looked exhausted. 
It's not likely to rain tomorrow. 
I know I can rely on you. 
I know that Tom did that correctly. 
Stop criticizing me! 
Tom says he didn't do it. 
I'm looking for you. 
Tom said that he knew I wasn't going to cry. 
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it. 
I think Tom is just curious. 
Everyone knows that Tom was the one who broke the window. 
Here's my pink notebook. 
I knew I could rely on you! 
I don't think Tom knows what he wants. 
I didn't know that Tom didn't need to do that by himself. 
It isn't like Tom is going anywhere. 
Tom told me that he was hesitant to do that. 
I pretended I didn't know what to do. 
I know that Tom is a bum. 
I didn't think Tom would permit you to do that. 
I want to go and change into that shirt I bought yesterday. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was lying. 
We should've stayed with you. 
I don't think Tom is lonely. 
This isn't the first time I've done this. 
If Tom can't do that, probably no one else can either. 
I thought Tom might stop by this afternoon. 
I think the economic impact will be minimal. 
You ought to let Tom know that Mary is going to do that. 
It would've been fun to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they don't plan on doing that anymore. 
I don't think Tom will need our help. 
Tom said Mary was feeling nervous. 
Tom and Mary said they were over thirty. 
I think Tom expected Mary to ask him to stay. 
Tom said that he's definitely not going to do that. 
I am not gay, but my boyfriend is. 
You know that's not right. 
Tom and Mary told me they don't want that. 
I know that Tom was at your house today. 
Tom isn't going to be able to do that by himself. 
Tom and Mary said they were going to work. 
Tom hasn't been told what happened yet. 
Tom said he expected Mary to win. 
Tom said Mary was unenthusiastic about that. 
Tom said he wished he hadn't been so late. 
They said that they're suspicious. 
Did you know that Tom was planning on moving to Boston? 
Tom said that he assumed Mary would want to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't finished doing that. 
I thought that was what we were supposed to do. 
I'd never do that to you. 
Tom should've been quicker at doing that than Mary. 
Tom and Mary said they planned on going on Monday. 
That's not what Tom really needs. 
They know that they can do better. 
There's no way Tom would've done what you say he did. 
Tom said he wasn't permitted to do that anymore. 
You are tired, aren't you? 
Did Tom do that by himself? 
Tom and Mary say they used to study French. 
Tom admitted he'd killed Mary. 
I would've been there by now if my car hadn't broken down. 
We are brothers. 
I wrote a long letter to Tom. 
It's going to be difficult to find someone to replace Tom. 
I don't think that giving Tom a knife was a good idea. 
I thought you were going to kill me. 
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do that. 
It is surprising that they should have a second house in America. 
They told me that they were depressed. 
My mother cannot drive a car at all. 
There's a lot that is happening right now. 
I wonder if Tom is rich. 
It isn't necessary for me to do that. 
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom did. 
I think you're bossy. 
Tom backed his car up to check, but the raccoon he had run over was dead as a doornail. 
Tom and Mary said they're not mad. 
I wonder if Tom has ever told Mary about what we did on that day. 
Close that door. 
The only reason Tom went to Australia because everyone else in his family did. 
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the prom. 
Are you sure no one can see us? 
He has a great fancy for travelling. 
Tom said Mary was likely to still be in jail. 
I'm not sure Tom would let anybody help Mary. 
Tom and Mary told everybody they were jealous. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were homesick. 
I think you know we need to buy some more food. 
I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us. 
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French. 
Tom must've left his umbrella on the bus. 
They told me that they're broke. 
No one but Tom did that. 
I don't think Tom will be surprised that that happened. 
I assume you're not interested in going with us. 
It's not easy to be understood by everyone. 
I am hungry. 
Tom said that he thought he was the only one who needed to do that. 
I thought that you might want something cold to drink. 
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him. 
No one's seen them. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was sleepy. 
Tom said he'd definitely do that this week. 
That's not my responsibility. 
I think that Tom is a student at Harvard. 
I didn't know I was doing that the wrong way. 
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think that John was glad that was going to happen. 
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner. 
They said that they'd do that for us. 
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you. 
Tom said that he thought prices at that store were too high. 
Tom said he didn't feel like eating. 
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses. 
I thought that you said that I could count on you. 
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago. 
Tom spent the money his grandmother had given him on books. 
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks. 
You should have said so at that time. 
Tom and Mary say they'll only talk to you. 
Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did. 
I've parked my car here many times and nobody's complained. 
Tom said that he was sad. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do. 
Tom said he was going back home. 
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested. 
I know I'm going to regret this. 
Tom thought Mary was bored. 
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that. 
Do you have any idea when Tom is planning on getting here? 
I know that you aren't planning on staying in Boston. 
I wonder whether that could happen again. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston. 
I couldn't abide looking at it. 
I think that Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French. 
The currently available evidence does not permit me to make such a claim. 
Tom said he's very sure Mary has to do that. 
Tom would've been happy if you had done that. 
Tom said he wants to talk to you. 
I thought you were a doctor. 
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number. 
Tom said he needed to stay home. 
I thought you were happy. 
I could've stopped it. 
It's not healthy to eat and run. 
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven. 
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that. 
We are invited to dinner. 
Tom and Mary said they felt repulsed. 
I know that Tom is afraid that he'll get lost. 
I ate the same thing Tom did. 
I know that Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried to. 
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity. 
I know that Tom isn't a very good guitar player. 
Tom and I were both impressed. 
Everyone knows Tom is lying. 
They're not as young as they say they are. 
Don't expect anyone to help you. 
Did you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that? 
I never thought I'd go there. 
You know that isn't true. 
I know Tom and Mary have both already left Australia. 
You're not like anyone else I know. 
Tom and Mary said they felt the same. 
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October. 
Tom thought you could take care of yourself. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was wrong. 
Tom has decided that he isn't going to work today. 
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that. 
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom. 
That's not happening! 
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught. 
It's not going to work out. 
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that. 
I think Tom lives in Australia. 
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves. 
You know it's not like that. 
I would've been unable to do that without your help. 
I knew that Tom didn't really want to do that by himself. 
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement. 
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter. 
Let's hope things stay this way. 
I should've anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary. 
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom was not aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents. 
I wonder whether Tom really knows the combination to this safe. 
Someone's singing. 
Mary doesn't plan on doing that until I tell her to. 
I didn't know that you were supposed to do that this afternoon. 
Tom said that he thought he knew the cause of the accident. 
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary. 
I don't think that can be fixed. 
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know. 
Tom didn't even know that Mary used to live in Boston. 
I didn't know that you needed to do that today. 
You should have enrolled your children months ago. 
I think that's not mine. 
I believe Tom is thirty years old. 
Think about it. 
I told Tom that you'd come to Australia. 
I didn't think that anybody would like Tom. 
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived. 
I didn't think that anybody had ever done that kind of a thing before. 
Tom didn't know Mary was planning on staying. 
That isn't something I know how to do. 
I think that I'll be able to fix it myself. 
I didn't think that anybody did that. 
Tom said we'd get lost. 
Tom said he should do that. 
Are you sure Mary said she was planning on doing that tomorrow? 
There were times I would've been lost without Tom. 
I know you're interested. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was insane. 
Tom already knows that Mary did that. 
You're not as smart as Tom. 
I don't think I really need to do that. 
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are. 
It's not going to end well. 
I think that I need someone to help me. 
Tom wrote in all caps. 
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that. 
I don't think that Tom needs to do that alone. 
If I were you, I would go home at once. 
It's not like you knew what they were going to do. 
Tom and I are planning to stay together. 
I know you're not ready to deal with this. 
So what are you suggesting? 
Tom said he learned something new. 
I know that Tom is married. 
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape. 
I thought you jury-rigged something. 
I have been studying English for three years. 
Tom is the only man I'd ever consider marrying. 
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was paralyzed. 
I know that Tom isn't planning on doing that. 
Tom didn't know that you were from Boston. 
It isn't as difficult as it sounds. 
Tom and Mary shouted, but no one heard them. 
Tom and Mary say they want to swim. 
Tom said Mary was likely to still be lonely. 
I didn't think Tom would be arrested. 
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning to join the team. 
You promised not to be rude to me any more. 
Tom thought it would take longer. 
I wonder whether Tom knew he needed to do that. 
I think Tom is like that. 
Tom had all sorts of problems. 
I knew that Tom would like you to do that for him. 
I thought Tom would want to see this movie. 
I think Tom is still undecided. 
I'm Tom's dad. 
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen. 
Tom said he'd do his homework before dinner. 
Tom stared at Mary and said nothing. 
I wonder whether Tom is really asleep. 
Tom and Mary said they want to die. 
Tom said he's had enough of that. 
I suspect that Tom is on vacation. 
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV. 
I don't think Tom is very bright. 
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John got here. 
Doing that would've been easy. 
Tom said that he thought he might be required to do that by himself. 
That's very good. 
Tom says that he wasn't the one who broke the window. 
It was clear that Tom was going to do that. 
They aren't sure that they should do that. 
The sort of information we need is not always available. 
I'd rather not talk about it. 
I didn't think anyone saw us. 
We can't turn back. 
I know that Tom knows we shouldn't do that. 
You didn't know that I didn't need to do that, did you? 
Tom suspected that it was too late to help Mary. 
Tom and I both sat back down. 
Tom was wearing the tie that Mary gave him. 
Tom and Mary said that they weren't alone. 
The question is not so much what it is as how it looks. 
I know that Tom is almost always correct, but this time he isn't. 
Tom said doing that wouldn't be dangerous. 
You're my hero, Sami. 
It's not like we're doing anything. 
Tom said that he felt insulted. 
Tom knew that Mary would win. 
Tom and Mary said they don't want this. 
It's not about them. 
I thought you said you wanted to do that by yourself. 
Tom must've had a key. 
Tom knew that there was a possibility that Mary would do that. 
You're so lazy. 
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were famished. 
It isn't socially acceptable to point at people. 
Tom would've permitted Mary to do that. 
I wish we'd stayed in Australia for another week. 
Here's the map you were looking for. 
I thought that you said you'd never do that again. 
Tom knows why Mary is planning to go to Australia. 
I wonder whether we have to do that. 
I know that Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that. 
This is the third time this week Tom has done that. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened. 
I know that Tom doesn't know he isn't supposed to be doing that today. 
Tom says everyone he knows can swim. 
Tom said he had a shovel in his pickup truck. 
It was clear that Tom liked doing that by himself. 
I don't think that what I did was wrong. 
I knew that Tom was afraid. 
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long. 
I figured I'd find you here. 
It isn't clear who wrote this letter. 
They must have been tired. 
Tom is doing OK. 
Tom said that he thought that he didn't need to do that. 
Tom said that Mary knew that he might not want to do that until John had time to help him. 
I didn't think Tom would like that. 
I never should've got you into this. 
I think everybody trusts me. 
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that. 
I hope that I'll see Tom tomorrow. 
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool? 
Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would unlikely want to do that. 
Tom said he'd come, but he never showed up. 
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done. 
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week. 
Tom is going to be able to do that eventually. 
The doctor advised me to leave off jogging because it was excessive exercise. 
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was. 
I don't think Tom will be back. 
Nobody was on the bus. 
Tom said he hoped Mary could win. 
Tom thought he'd lost his wallet, but eventually found it after searching the house for an hour or so. 
Tom told me he wasn't impressed. 
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here. 
It was clear that Tom hadn't done that yet. 
Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street. 
Tom said that he thought I might have to do that soon. 
Did you know that your socks don't match? 
You know that's got to be done today, don't you? 
I think that Tom is about to start crying. 
She took him by the arm. 
Tom said he felt intimidated. 
It's not worth the effort. 
Somebody's waiting in your office. 
I'm sorry we dragged you into this. 
Tom said he's not thirsty. 
Tom told me Mary did that wrong. 
I knew that Tom might get hurt if he tried to do that. 
Isn't that what you would have done? 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be courteous. 
I guess that's not really important. 
Why is Tom wearing a cape? 
Tom said Mary was able to do that, too. 
That's a mistake a lot of people make. 
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week. 
I know that Tom didn't know that I couldn't do that. 
I know that Tom is a lot younger than Mary is. 
It's not an easy solution. 
Tom said that his mother never loved him. 
Tom should've stayed longer. 
Tom knows he's in real trouble now. 
There's no doubt that Tom will do that for us. 
I don't have anything I need to say to Tom. 
I don't think Tom knows what I'm planning to do. 
The men are wearing short sleeves. 
Tom said he'd take care of Mary. 
I knew that eventually this would happen. 
It's not hard to guess what's going to happen. 
Tom will never hurt anyone. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be required to do that by herself. 
I thought everyone knew. 
I'm afraid I don't know. 
Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would be amused by what was happening. 
Tom said he'd be home for dinner. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
Tom told me he didn't know Mary. 
Tom didn't want anybody to get mad. 
Tom thought Mary was John's girlfriend. 
I can't stand this noise. 
I know that Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary. 
The police believe Tom and Mary were murdered. 
I guarantee that's not going to happen. 
Tom claims he was born in 2013. 
I don't think Tom is tough. 
Tom has decided that he's going to say yes. 
I hope Tom isn't dead. 
They said that they don't do that. 
Tom knows this is a tough situation. 
Tom knew that what he was going to do would make Mary angry. 
Tom could've done that without Mary's help. 
Tom thought he might not be required to do that. 
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay. 
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be mad. 
Tom said Mary was willing to do the cooking. 
I hope I don't start crying. 
You should've done that with us. 
I don't think it's impossible. 
I know that Tom is a pretty good swimmer. 
Tom hasn't been appointed chairman yet. 
I wonder whether there's any cheese left in the refrigerator. 
What are you good at? 
I wonder if Tom and Mary were supposed to do that. 
Tom said he didn't have to do that. 
Tom said he didn't want to work late. 
I suspect Tom and Mary both have houses in Australia. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was the only one who had to do that. 
Tom said that he was hoping you'd win. 
I think Tom and Mary are both going to get fired. 
I thought that was your job. 
Tom told me that John was a terrible roommate. 
I wonder whether Tom is reliable. 
I think Tom will do that as well. 
I knew Tom was studying. 
I know that Tom is a gun owner. 
It will take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi. 
Nobody has done it yet. 
Tom said he didn't want me to worry. 
I know that Tom will be doing that with me this afternoon. 
We aren't planning to do that together. 
Let's check why your answers differ from mine. 
They told me that they disagreed. 
I don't think Tom was upset. 
Tom knows he should do that, but he doesn't want to. 
Tom is also a member of our group. 
My parents don't allow me to do that. 
They told me that they didn't win. 
Tom said he wasn't having fun. 
I think Tom was in love with Mary. 
Tom was not very energetic. 
They say that they like marigolds. 
"Is everybody talking about me?" "No, Tom. You're not that important." 
I don't think it'll be hard to do that. 
It's not something that I'm proud of. 
Are both Tom and Mary still sick? 
I can't believe you did that. 
I knew that Tom wasn't yet finished doing that. 
I don't think that it's worth the price you paid for it. 
I think Tom should go home. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be alone. 
I promise I won't hit anyone. 
Tom said he'd try doing that today. 
Both Tom and Mary used to live on Park Street. 
I know that Tom knows that Mary ought to do that. 
Tom said he felt much happier now. 
Tom said he doesn't even want to think about it. 
The joke's on you. 
I am determined to give up smoking. 
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away. 
Tom told me he liked snow. 
Tom and Mary never should've done that together. 
Every man cannot be happy. 
I promise I won't do that. 
Tom said he hopes Mary likes doing that. 
I swear that I'll tell you everything someday. 
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers, and true to our founding documents. 
Tom didn't know that Mary had gone to Boston. 
I was the only one there who knew that Tom wanted to do that. 
Tom says that he intends to win. 
I know that Tom seldom does that anymore. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still alone. 
I don't think I would enjoy doing that outside in the winter. 
The rumour quickly spread. 
There is no way you're going out dressed like that. 
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we will all die. 
You are embarrassing. 
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do that tomorrow. 
It's not that weird, is it? 
I didn't know I was violating any laws. 
Do you promise me you'll do that? 
You should tell Tom he's not likely to win. 
They say that they're willing to help. 
There's a possibility that it's real. 
I know I did the right thing. 
Tom says that he despises Mary. 
I suspect Tom is in there. 
I knew that Tom was a pretty good jazz saxophone player. That's why I wanted him to join our band. 
I think Tom is trying to trick us. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't forgotten to buy a birthday present for Mary. 
Tom probably can't do that any faster that than Mary can. 
Both Tom and Mary have put on some weight since the last time I saw them. 
Are you planning to tell Tom and Mary why you wanted them to do that? 
If Tom could've spoken French, he'd have had more fun. 
I don't think Tom was excited. 
I suspect Tom is likely to do that tomorrow. 
I think Tom is still depressed. 
Tom said he never agreed to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is in the hospital. 
I must've overlooked something. 
Tom plans to leave Boston next year. 
What's Tom's problem? 
I know that Tom would be happy doing that. 
Tom didn't know that Mary was supposed to help John do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was healthy. 
It's not you, it's me! 
I thought you were going to stay with Tom. 
I don't think Tom is involved. 
Tom said he doesn't plan to do that by himself. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might want to do that this evening. 
I thought Tom had already been compensated for that. 
I promise you that I'll be there to help you. 
Tom said he thought I didn't look like I was enjoying myself. 
There's no reason Tom wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom said he'd try. 
Tom said he was planning to stay in Australia next summer. 
There's a chance that Tom was wrong. 
I'm fat. 
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary not to do that anymore. 
Tom told me that he needed space. 
Let's go to the beach. 
Tom seems to have many friends. 
Tom might not have enough money to buy what he needs. 
Tom said he's not sure Mary can do that. 
Tom really should've eaten more for breakfast. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were terrified. 
Tom told Mary that he was happy. 
Tom said he was tired of waiting. 
Why do you suspect that Tom was the one who did that? 
Tom said he's been having fun hanging out with us. 
The earthquake smashed everything. 
I knew we should've brought more food with us. 
They put their bathing suits on. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary has to do that today. 
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy. 
I don't think Tom has much experience doing that. 
Tom said he didn't mind eating after the children ate. 
In France the first name comes before the surname. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that. 
I'm pretty sure both Tom and Mary have passed away. 
I know that Tom knew he shouldn't have done that. 
They know that they're in real trouble now. 
Tom said that he thought Mary could do that. 
I didn't know that you weren't planning on doing that by yourselves. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary shouldn't be doing that. 
I know that Tom is a selfish person. 
Mary says she isn't planning on going. 
Do you plan to do that? 
I'm sorry Tom had to leave so early. 
I had hoped you'd tell me everything yourself. 
There is nothing to apologize for. 
I'd rather go swimming. 
I've been planning on doing that for months. 
I'm sorry I was so slow. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't eat meat anymore. 
I'm surprised Tom won. 
It's possible. 
Tom said he needed to take a nap. 
I promised Tom I'd wait. 
Tom said that he hopes Mary will help him. 
Tom told me he believed Mary. 
Tom hasn't quit yet. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would be able to do that. 
Tom knew that there was a possibility that Mary would do that. 
Please come in. 
I don't think that'll happen anymore. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he was the only one who knew how to do that. 
Tom couldn't find what he was looking for. 
I didn't know you were going to be nervous. 
I know that you don't like me, but we have to work together. 
I know that you ought to do that. 
I was surprised Tom didn't come yesterday. 
A true friend would've helped. 
I know Tom will love it. 
Tom told me that he thought I should lose some weight. 
Tom said he'd rather do that next week. 
I think Tom is prejudiced. 
I thought it was a mistake to tell Tom where we buried the treasure. 
I haven't called back yet. 
Tom said Mary didn't look much older than John. 
Tom is probably a bit younger than I am. 
You are out of danger. 
It isn't worth repairing this camera. 
I know that's not the truth. 
They promised that they'd do that this week. 
I don't think I have ever been this hungry before. 
I knew that Tom would help Mary do that. 
I knew Tom wouldn't accept our offer. 
Tom said he thought he'd be able to help us today. 
Tom knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was glad that that was going to happen. 
I don't think I have any chance of winning. 
My mother being ill, I couldn't go to the concert. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might want to do that this evening. 
Tom and Mary said that they were very sad. 
I figure that my vote won't change anything. 
Tom is back on the junk. 
What makes you think it was Tom who did this? 
We both agreed with Tom. 
I know that Tom won't have to do that by himself. 
I know that Tom isn't a very reasonable man. 
They promised that they'd be here on Monday. 
I thought it would be difficult for her to get the tickets. 
Tom said he'd do that as well. 
I thought that Tom was a computer programmer. 
Tom said he'd help me figure out how to do that. 
I know that Tom is a better singer than Mary is. 
Tom is Mary's father. 
I don't think Tom will do that. 
Tom denied he knew anything about the bank robbery. 
Everybody knows I hate you. 
She will have been in hospital for a month next Monday. 
Tom said he saw Mary spanking one of her children. 
That's something I should've done a long time ago. 
I didn't know that Tom had only one leg. 
Hello again. 
The show is on Wednesday. 
I'm at home right now. 
I soon found out that I wasn't talented enough. 
I don't think anyone suspected that you weren't really Tom. 
Go away and leave me alone! 
You should tell Tom that Mary is planning to do that. 
It's not always easy to tell the difference between good and bad. 
Tom is even lazier than Mary. 
That's not funny. 
I don't think anybody could've stopped Tom. 
Tom didn't think he had a chance to succeed, but he at least wanted to give it a shot. 
I suspect Tom has already left for Australia. 
They told me that they had been sick. 
I know that I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad that I did. 
I don't think I can do that tonight. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was next. 
Tom and Mary put down their spoons. 
What will the neighbors think? 
Tom said that he hopes that you try your best to win. 
How did you know I needed to do that? 
Tom has already asked me not to do that. 
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he'd do that. 
Tom said he wouldn't do that. 
Tom said he thought Mary was in her room listening to music. 
I don't think that's realistic. 
I don't think that's right. 
They told me that they're through doing that. 
Tom should have known this. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that I don't want to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary could play the saxophone. 
I don't think I can love two people at the same time. 
Tom said that he thought I was creative. 
There is a serious problem. 
I wonder whether I should do that. 
I don't think that's going to happen today. 
I don't think there's any reason that Tom has to do that. 
Tom's good at his job. 
Tom said Mary often does that. 
Rape survivors are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder than survivors of other traumatic experiences. 
I thought Tom would be the next one to do that. 
No one remembered that today was my birthday. 
I know Tom saved Mary's life. 
I think that Tom is alone in his room. 
I know that Tom didn't really need to do that. 
Tom wasn't the one who gave Mary that. 
Tom told me that I'm slow. 
I didn't do that as much last week as I usually do. 
Tom told me he was over thirty. 
Tom and Mary showed me the letter they received from John. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would need to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would want to do that. 
Tom was the one who told me you shouldn't do that. 
I didn't think that anybody would dispute that. 
I know Tom is a much better singer than I am. 
Tom said he thought Mary was likely to cry. 
Tom thinks that he's the only person in town who can play the bagpipes. 
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary often eat together? 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was out. 
They said they were exhausted. 
Tom has written lots of books. 
Tom and Mary both want to eat steak for dinner. 
I know you probably want some help. 
I'm sorry I made you worry. 
Tom said he was planning on going to Australia next summer. 
I wonder what Tom is planning to buy. 
I don't think Tom knows that I hate him. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was deaf. 
I don't think Tom has ever done that. 
Send him to me! 
Tom said he didn't plan to go this week. 
Do you do the same with your kids? 
Tom said he's starved. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't able to do that. 
He's got to see a specialist. 
I knew that would happen. 
I know Tom is in Australia now. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary knows how to do that very well. 
I didn't think Tom would be worried about something like that. 
Is this the first time you've ever given blood? 
Have you had tea? 
Tom was unable to find Mary a good job. 
My bike has a flat tyre. 
I know Tom was shaken. 
Good night! 
It's all going to be OK. 
Tom is convinced that everyone hates him. 
I know that Tom will do that for you. 
When was the last time you visited Boston? 
They say that they didn't have to do that. 
I know I'm rambling. 
I thought that you said that it was getting fixed. 
He respects you. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were miserable. 
They told me that they'd call you later. 
I know that Tom knew that Mary knew how to do that. 
Tom said Mary went to Australia. 
Why isn't there any food in the fridge? 
Tom told me he liked it. 
I know that Tom knows who did that to Mary. 
I have read a book. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was confused. 
You ought to let Tom know that you can't do that. 
I thought Tom would be safe here. 
Tom thought Mary might not be permitted to do that anymore. 
No one answered my questions. 
Tom told me he wasn't planning on doing that. 
I think Tom could've gotten home by himself. 
You should have seen me. 
Lūṭ was a prophet of God. 
Doing that won't be as hard you think. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still homesick. 
I'm surprised Tom remembers me. 
If you had asked for my advice, I would've advised you not to do that. 
Tom said he didn't want to hang out with Mary anymore. 
Tom thought Mary might not have to do that anymore. 
I wasn't aware Tom should do that. 
They're surprised. 
I like foreign languages! 
What've you been watching? 
Tom told me he thought that Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he thought it would be better not to go outside. 
It might not be as hard to do as you think it'll be. 
We're in the same time zone. 
I thought you knew both Tom and Mary were allergic to peanuts. 
They knew that they wouldn't win. 
Tom and Mary said that they agreed to do that. 
It's a beautiful day! 
You are more than welcome to come over. 
They said that they'd do that later. 
He can speak Russian as well. 
Tom said that he wanted that, so I gave it to him. 
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't eat the stew Mary made for him. 
Tom said he thought I was lazy. 
I wonder whether Tom wants to dance. 
Tom must be reluctant to do that. 
Tom's speech wasn't as boring as Mary's. 
Tom died without telling his secret to anybody. 
Tom knows Mary is angry. 
They know that they need to do that soon. 
Call me anything but late for dinner. 
We did not see a single game. 
Tom said he'd rather not spend much time doing that. 
I think Tom stays at his grandparents' house whenever he visits Boston. 
I don't think Tom wants to do that anymore. 
I know that Tom has tried to do that. 
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you. 
I think Tom is careless. 
I think Tom ought to wait until at least 2:30 before he leaves. 
I thought Tom would be present at today's meeting. 
Tom said that Mary knew that he might be required to do that. 
That would've been the smart thing to do. 
I think Tom will listen to me. 
I could have sworn something moved. 
Tom said that he thought it might happen in Boston, too. 
I didn't think anybody could've stopped Tom. 
I want to know if Tom and Mary need to do that, too. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are exhausted. 
The world isn't as scary as you think. 
I think Tom is deranged. 
I know you don't want to do that, but you need to. 
Let's hope that's enough time. 
Tom is one of the ugliest people that I know. 
I'm very glad to see you. 
I didn't think that anybody suspected you weren't Tom. 
Put on your socks quickly. We're late. 
Tom told everyone that he was starved. 
Tom told me he knew how to speak French. 
I'm absolutely certain that Tom is wrong. 
I thought I'd give it another try. 
I thought it was strange that Tom wasn't at Mary's party. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was unbiased. 
I don't think you should've left early. 
Tom said Mary wouldn't likely be able to do that. 
Tom said he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore. 
I had no idea you knew Tom. 
We will discuss this problem later. 
I don't think Tom has anybody to help him. 
How is it going? 
Tom thinks that he can do whatever he wants. 
I know that I can't do that as well as Tom can. 
I know that Tom is planning on doing that tomorrow. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be interested. 
It is not especially hot today. 
I wasn't as successful as Tom. 
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that kind of thing. 
If you don't go, I won't either. 
What are your plans? 
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that I shouldn't do that. 
Tom thought that Mary didn't like him. 
Tom said he did nothing illegal. 
Tom said he already did that. 
I think you're going to be OK. 
I knew that Tom was still willing to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he was glad that that had happened. 
The computer has stopped working. 
We know that you aren't stupid. 
She didn't turn up after all. 
We both know that's a lie. 
Tom knows we aren't supposed to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night. 
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that. 
I don't think Tom is in Australia now. 
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should be doing. 
Both Tom and Mary can do that. 
I thought you might know. 
Tom's flaky. 
It isn't always easy to face reality. 
Tom says that he won't win. 
Tom was aware that they were following him. 
What the hell was that supposed to mean? 
I know I'm in big trouble now. 
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do? 
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia. 
Tom would've never done that if Mary had asked him not to. 
I thought that you said that you weren't interested. 
It was harder to do that than Tom said it would be. 
I don't think Tom will be going to Australia with Mary. 
I'm so tired. 
I'm 18 years old. 
They're not coming. 
Tom probably doesn't yet know the rules. 
Let's hope that you're cured. 
I know somebody ought to do that. 
I can't speak French as well as you. 
You should've listened to Tom more carefully. 
Tom said I should let you drive. 
What's your favorite fast-food restaurant? 
Why is Tom wearing that hat? 
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes. 
I don't think we could do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary wants to do that. 
The clock has stopped. 
Tom and I both grew up in Boston. 
Tom said he was an artist. 
I don't think Tom will be back soon. 
I didn't think we had enough money. 
You should've heard me. I shouted as loud as I could. 
I am giving you what you want. 
I knew that Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him. 
I know that Tom is a good writer. 
They said that they'd never want to do that. 
They said that they'd eat fruit. 
Tom said he didn't have to do that now. 
I thought you wouldn't like Boston. 
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight. 
I love you and I always will. 
No. 
I know that Tom isn't a very good hitter. 
I don't think I'm the best person for the job. 
They say that they'd be willing to help us. 
It's not open for debate. 
Tom told everyone that he was unemployed. 
I know that'll be hard to do. 
How are you planning on doing that? 
It's beyond me. 
I am a bit out of shape! 
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else? 
It's going to be hard to find somebody to replace Tom. 
I should have been more careful. 
Tom and Mary thought that they were being cute. 
I thought you had learned that by now. 
I never said I could understand French. 
Tom is just as smart as Mary. 
They wished that they hadn't said that. 
I wonder whether Tom is planning to quit his job. 
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that. 
I'm going crazy. 
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed. 
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston. 
I'm glad no one is around. 
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her. 
I don't think we have a choice. 
Tom couldn't defend himself. 
Do what Tom tells you to do. 
Saturday is the last day of the week. 
I know that Tom will likely know how to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be grumpy. 
I know that Tom knows why we didn't that on Monday. 
Who is your favorite singer? 
I promise you I'll help you. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not want to do that again. 
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train. 
I'm a lot taller than Tom. 
I know that Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too. 
I know that Tom would be quicker at doing that than Mary. 
My handwriting is better than Tom's. 
Hello, what's your name? 
They say that they won't be here tomorrow. 
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston. 
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor. 
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid. 
I know that Tom knew that I was planning to do that. 
You should've been able to do that much better. 
We work every day but Monday. 
I know you weren't the ones who did that. 
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it. 
I know that Tom and Mary are married. 
I should've been here yesterday. 
It isn't heavy. 
That's the reason Tom went to Australia. 
I thought you were excited that I was getting married. 
Tom told me he'd likely cry. 
I thought they'd find someone else. 
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that. 
I doubt very seriously that Tom did that on purpose. 
I figured you might be busy now. 
Tom said he thought that we should do that by ourselves. 
I don't think this is an exception. 
I know you don't like me very much. 
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today. 
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today. 
Tom said something the other night about that. 
Tom admitted he wasn't brave. 
I know I should've done that. 
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer. 
I suspect Tom is waiting for us. 
Dogs who are dead can't bite. 
I don't think that Tom is as crazy as some people think. 
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself. 
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us. 
She avoided his eyes. 
Tom isn't as fat as I am. 
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves. 
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that. 
I thought Tom must be mistaken. 
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did. 
They said that they didn't like this. 
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston. 
I should've introduced myself. 
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired. 
I cannot recall when he moved to Boston. 
I've never fallen in love with anyone. 
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that. 
Tom is liked by everyone. 
I didn't think anyone thought you're crazy. 
He hasn't got a mobile. 
I think Tom will ask you to marry him. 
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself. 
There's no need for Tom to do that. 
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that. 
I suspect Tom is involved. 
How many kilos have you lost? 
Both Tom and Mary are OK. 
I'm a despicable human being. 
I'll never forget the time that you and I went to Australia together. 
Tom isn't the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight. 
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave. 
Tom told me that he's sleepy. 
Mary tried on her mother's clothes. 
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle. 
I pried off the lid. 
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now. 
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here. 
I'm three years older than you are. 
When is your birthday? 
They said that they were hurt. 
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone. 
I would've helped you. 
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married. 
I didn't hurt anybody. 
We cannot play baseball here. 
Tom and Mary say they won't mind. 
I'm not in the mood. 
I thought that you said you had fun doing that. 
Where did you learn to do that? 
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston. 
I have been on a diet for more than a year. 
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that. 
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license. 
I know that Tom is a fairly good drummer. 
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything. 
Tom said Mary should've done that alone. 
I didn't know you were still living with your parents. 
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervane. 
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian? 
Come on, guys. This is not funny anymore. 
I suspect Tom is at home, sleeping. 
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again. 
Tom threw up. 
Tom doesn't like this color. 
Tom must've left the water running. 
I'm a farmer. 
It's not easy being married to Tom. 
I didn't know that there was a swimming pool here. 
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned. 
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted. 
Tom said he's a Canadian. 
I'd like to have another cup of coffee. 
I presume that Tom is still married to Mary. 
Tom said everybody he knows enjoys doing that. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday. 
I know that Tom can probably do that sometime today. 
Do you let your children play in the street? 
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone. 
Tom doubts that Mary can do that. 
There is a cat under the desk. 
I think Tom is unkind. 
I don't think Tom knows when it happened. 
Is it true Tom is moving to Boston? 
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore. 
I thought you looked tired. 
Tom said I looked impatient. 
I think Tom could make Mary do that. 
I am interested in chess these days. 
I don't think I'd like living in Australia. 
Tom said Mary should've done that by herself. 
My parents died when I was three. 
I think Tom was misled. 
What you are saying is absolutely wrong. 
He is depressed. 
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow. 
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now. 
Tom said Mary is thirsty. 
They said that they didn't enjoy doing that. 
I am peeling apples. 
They said that they'd never study French. 
They said that they thought I was creative. 
Tom told me that he's uncertain what he should do. 
Tom told me that I should've said yes. 
Tom did not press the button. 
There was nothing left in the fridge. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not need to do that. 
I knew Tom wouldn't likely have to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well. 
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there on time. 
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow. 
Tom said that he knew I might have to do that. 
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that. 
Tom said he doesn't plan on going with us this weekend. 
I don't think that Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do. 
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars. 
Everybody loves free stuff. 
I don't think this is funny. 
If Tom does that, I will, too. 
I know that Tom is still in his office. 
Tom and Mary said they're prepared to help me. 
Tom isn't the one who told me that Mary should do that. 
I thought that you said that you'd still like to do that. 
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that or not. 
They say that they're not planning on going. 
Tom's a very nice boy. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that. 
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that. 
Tom doesn't think Mary is annoyed. 
I don't think I can hold on much longer. 
Tom isn't as tall as Mary. 
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary. 
I know you're a coward. 
You're lying! 
I told Tom that I disagreed. 
I think Tom is talking to Mary now. 
I've already promised Tom I'd help him. 
I believe that everybody deserves a chance. 
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting. 
Tom doesn't know that I have to do that today. 
I don't think you really want to call attention to that. 
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that. 
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John. 
Leave the lights on, please. 
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit. 
I thought Tom was in big trouble. 
I listened to everybody. 
It doesn't work. 
Tom's speech lasted for three hours. 
I wonder whether Tom is alive. 
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom. 
Tom may be surprised. 
I don't think that anyone would want to see that movie more than once. 
I cannot recall anything else at this time. 
Tom needs to know that somebody cares. 
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long. 
Tom told Mary he'd never be coming back here. 
I didn't know that you couldn't do that by yourself. 
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy. 
He cannot stop me. 
I think Tom is irresponsible. 
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two. 
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday. 
I think that Tom is doing something illegal. 
Our streets flood when we have rain. 
I will probably be busy this afternoon. 
I don't think you have much choice. 
Tom said he thought that he might do that on October 20th. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that. 
I knew that Tom might be permitted to do that again. 
Tom gave me the last piece of cake. 
I know that Tom is a very good drummer. 
We know you're working for them. 
Everyone here except Tom has done that. 
I think that you should do it yourselves. 
I think that everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of. 
Tom knew he could've done that better. 
Tom said that he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was displeased. 
I wonder if it's safe to camp here. 
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that. 
I am a university student. 
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong. 
Which country are you from? 
Tom and I are both students. 
I don't think that I've made enough spaghetti for everyone. 
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that. 
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves. 
Are you saying you don't want to do this? 
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that. 
I can assure you that's not going to happen. 
Tom plans to sit in the back. 
Tom said that he'd given a book to Mary. 
It would have been unbearable. 
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that. 
I know that Tom was a scrawny kid. 
Tom said he had no reason to stay. 
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame. 
I'm not surprised that Tom plans on doing that. 
Hardly anybody expected Tom to win. 
Don't twist my words! 
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be. 
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them. 
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold? 
Tom knows he can trust me. 
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on staying in Australia very long. 
I hear you've given up smoking. 
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that. 
I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much. 
Tom may be awake now. 
It's not reasonable. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced. 
Tom told me that he was next. 
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by himself. 
Tom said he was good at speaking French. 
This is not salt. 
Has anyone here seen Tom? 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was wrong. 
My dog sleeps in the same room that I do. 
He did not keep his word. 
I know that that's not true. 
Tom said he's planning on doing that. 
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible. 
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can. 
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow. 
I know you're not ready to deal with this. 
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary had been careful. 
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa. 
I found out both Tom and Mary like romance novels. 
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday. 
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day. 
Tom told everyone that he was prepared to do that. 
We will go on a picnic if it is fine tomorrow. 
Promise me you won't tell anybody 
It's not Tom who needs protection. It's Mary. 
They said that they're irritated. 
I think Tom will probably be able to do that. 
Tom did that whenever he could. 
They said that their houses weren't for sale. 
I'm not fat. 
I thought that I wouldn't be able to do that. 
I think we have more important things we should be doing now. 
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least one time. 
I don't think I know anyone here. 
They say that they want to win. 
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher. 
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be sleepy. 
Can somebody please help me? 
I know that Tom is about the same age as your daughter. 
I know that Tom is a very lucky guy. 
Tom thought I might not be permitted to do that by myself. 
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow. 
I know Tom is easygoing. 
I think Tom will be lonely. 
It seems like Tom likes everyone. 
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday. 
Mary's got to settle into her new flat. 
Tom and Mary said that they spoke French last week. 
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that. 
They swore that they'd never done that. 
Everyone stood there, shocked. 
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that. 
Tom told me he wasn't offended. 
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should've been. 
Tom doesn't look too good. 
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself. 
I don't think that Tom looks like his brother. 
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen. 
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleepy or not. 
I know I made a mistake. 
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you? 
They wished that they could fly. 
What a beautiful sunset! 
I have seen Mt. Fuji. 
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed. 
They said that they don't like to do that. 
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now. 
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that. 
You shouldn't just assume Tom is guilty. 
Watch yourselves. 
Mary said that she wasn't planning on doing that. 
Somebody's got to tell Tom what to do. 
I didn't know that Tom did that was when he was thirteen. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that you can win. 
Tom and I are both vegetarians. 
Tom said that I was the only one who thanked him. 
Enough is enough! 
I wonder whether Tom knew I needed to do that. 
Did you know that Tom did that? 
I guess it's like that everywhere. 
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children. 
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value. 
That could've hit me. 
They told me that they're losing weight. 
My house is not big. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't do that. 
You didn't know that I was still planning on joining the team, did you? 
The bathroom was not very clean. 
They said they were safe. 
Tom said that he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him. 
Tom thought Mary would be the first one to do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious. 
This is something that I made for you. 
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music. 
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help. 
Except for Tom, everyone did that. 
She has been ill for three weeks. 
Tom said he wished he could speak French better. 
I can't dance. 
Tom hasn't got a prayer. 
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself. 
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that. 
Tom's not missing, is he? 
I have left my umbrella in the phone booth. 
I did a bad thing. 
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that. 
I've promised Tom that I'd do that. 
I thought Tom would never show up. 
That's too good to be true. 
Tom said doing that would be fun. 
Tom found it hard to be obedient. 
Courgettes are green. 
I never should've broken up with Mary. 
I wish I were in Australia right now. 
Tom knew that I'd be early. 
Tom tossed his dog some bread. 
What does this have to do with us? 
How do I know you're telling me the truth? 
Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that. 
That's just not possible. 
I'm afraid we can't do anything. 
I'm pretty sure I can do that. 
Tom says that he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together. 
Why did you fail in the entrance examination? 
Tom found it hard to remain impartial. 
Tom told me he had to leave. 
Tom says that he can't prove Mary did that. 
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were bored. 
Tom said that he's glad you're coming. 
Tom thought Mary was really mean. 
I know that there will be a lot of good food at the picnic. 
Does anyone have any questions so far? 
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that. 
Tom was never afraid of anybody. 
They said that they'd rather come next week. 
What are you referring to? 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was amused by what was going on. 
Everyone in the room did the same thing. 
They are inseparable. 
Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that. 
They promised that they wouldn't do that. 
I really thought Tom would do that. 
You must've done that last year. 
Could you take a picture of me? 
We should've expected that to happen. 
It would've been wise to do that. 
Tom told me that he doesn't have a problem with that. 
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself. 
Tom has to be irritated. 
For how long has your head been hurting? 
Thanks, bud! 
Tom said nobody was fired. 
Do you think we should've gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here? 
He has earache. 
I don't think that Tom wants to do that by himself. 
I'm not certain that I can trust Tom. 
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that. 
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom. 
It isn't just my problem. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was high. 
I know that Tom is a millionaire. 
Tom said that he thought that doing that would be safe. 
I don't think I'll permit Tom to do that. 
No pain, no gain. 
I admit I've done that. 
I think Tom doesn't eat meat. 
I hope that we don't have problems with Tom. 
Here is your bag. 
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise. 
I'll never tell anyone. 
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian. 
I think Tom is a good coach. 
Tom and Mary told me they could help us. 
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that. 
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived. 
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us. 
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago. 
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that. 
Tom would've done the same thing you did. 
I don't think Tom is downstairs. 
I need to know that we can depend on Tom. 
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that. 
I realize that that isn't very likely to happen. 
They say that drug is not safe. 
I know that it's highly unlikely anybody can help me. 
I think Tom is going to call you. 
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person. 
Tom said that he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened. 
Tom thought Mary would likely not cry. 
This work is enough to break my back. 
That never would've happened if you'd done what I told you to do. 
I wonder whether Tom wanted to go to Boston with us. 
I can't. 
We need to replace our water heater. 
Does anybody have a kleenex? 
Tom told us that he thought that he could become a famous singer. 
We've already done that. 
Tom is a hemophiliac. 
I wouldn't have said anything. 
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had. 
Tom said that he knew you could do that. 
Tom and I are both wrong. 
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that. 
What's your mother's name? 
I don't think that Tom is the person you should be talking to. 
Sami knows what I'm talking about. 
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this. 
Tom said that I had to study French. 
You aren't obligated to do that, are you? 
You've got a big head. 
He's very smart. 
I never would've hired Tom. 
Does Tom know that you've done that already? 
Tom ate more than I ate. 
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last Monday. 
Tom said that he didn't think that anyone could do that. 
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that. 
Did anyone go to Australia with you? 
Tom said that he thought that I'd want to do that. 
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that. 
I hope this is enough food for everybody. 
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore. 
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that. 
Tom said I should come home soon. 
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful. 
Tom would've done that. 
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that. 
I'd like to visit Boston again. 
With teaching and studying my time is taken up. 
I think Tom is conceited. 
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that. 
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that. 
They say that they'll quit doing that. 
Tom is incompetent. 
Tom thinks that Mary drinks like a fish. 
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad that I did. 
Tom said that he thought that he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary. 
Tom and Mary said they told you. 
Tom said that he thinks that Mary can't do that. 
I know that Tom is a golfer. Maybe he could teach you how to play. 
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married. 
I knew that Tom would be able to do that without some help. 
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter. 
What else do you plan to do? 
I think that Tom understood everything. 
I know you're happy about that. 
Tom's downstairs. 
I know Tom is talkative. 
It's not my business. 
Mary has a big postcard collection. 
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money. 
Tom says you're willing to help. 
I assume you would like to meet Tom. 
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston. 
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary goodnight last night. 
I don't think anybody saw us. 
I knew that Tom wasn't a bad student. 
It's unlikely Tom will do that. 
Is it hard to milk a goat? 
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite? 
Tom doesn't know I have three cats. 
I should've quit while I was ahead. 
Is anyone alive here? 
I thought I told you to keep the door closed. 
My grandmother texts faster than you. 
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston? 
Let's hit the slopes! 
What's your favorite word? 
Tom knows he made the right choice. 
I thought that you said you'd do that for Tom. 
I didn't think anybody noticed what you did. 
I wonder whether I could help Tom. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interesting. 
You aren't the only one here who can speak French, are you? 
Get out of here. 
I know this isn't hard. 
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet. 
I thought you might be hungry. 
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here. 
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week? 
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him. 
You're not still afraid, are you? 
I thought you'd cry. 
The value of health cannot be overestimated. 
You will suffer because of that. 
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it'll cost. 
Tom said he's healthy. 
I know that Tom is nice. 
Tom already knows Mary is planning on doing that. 
Don't take off your gloves. 
Keep it up! 
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again. 
Tom should've been able to show you how to do that. 
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary should've done that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was unfriendly. 
Put your pants on. 
They said that they weren't ready to talk. 
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that. 
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him. 
Are there a lot of Africans in Germany? 
Where did you put the television guide? 
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty. 
It is true that the earth is round. 
Tom couldn't help smiling. 
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well. 
Check out that girl. 
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be handicapped. 
I told Tom that you'd come to Australia. 
Tom thinks that's a mistake. 
I knew that Tom was a reasonable guy. 
Tom thought Mary was downstairs. 
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that. 
Tom said he was ready to do whatever was necessary. 
Tom said he owes Mary a lot of money. 
Tom said he thought I was creative. 
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you. 
It's not safe to go out after dark by yourself. 
Did you know Tom had a son? 
Tom knows Mary likes Boston. 
Tom and Mary said they isn't likely to win. 
Tom told me that he'd been forgiven. 
Tom said he thought that Mary would do that tomorrow. 
Tom knows there's only one course of action possible. 
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win. 
They say that they lost their keys. 
I've decided never to do that again. 
I didn't know that you were dating Tom. 
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet. 
I know you still want to do that. 
Please tell Tom and Mary that they're not required to do that. 
Good job, guys! 
I know that Tom doesn't know that he isn't supposed to be doing that today. 
Tom and Mary say that they didn't want to do that. 
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year. 
Don't you know that everyone is talking about us? 
Tom said that Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday. 
I know Tom's house is for sale. 
I don't think Tom is sad. 
I don't think Tom will really win. 
I'd have wanted to do that with you. 
I'm not interested in sex. 
Tom told everybody he was determined to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was strict. 
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself. 
We wish we could've done more to help. 
Tom said he thought that it would snow tonight. 
I promised Tom I'd be home early. 
Tom said he would look at it. 
Tom said doing that was more difficult than he thought it would be. 
You would've loved the movie. 
They told me that they don't really care what happens. 
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's. 
I didn't know that Tom would be willing to show me how to do that. 
I'm sorry I bothered you. 
Everyone seems to be afraid but you. 
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything. 
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French? 
I'm a damage doer. 
Tom didn't know I was from Australia. 
You could've gone. 
Tom said that he didn't think the smell bothered Mary. 
He thinks I'm in love with her. 
I thought you were a better chess player than this. 
I'm glad to see that Tom is happy again. 
I thought Tom had already left. 
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that. 
I don't think we have much time. 
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary. 
I don't think Tom would've done that for me. 
Tom is the funniest person I've ever met. 
I doubt Tom really plans to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not have to do that this week. 
I know that Tom knows that he didn't need to do that. 
To tell the truth, I am not your father. 
I don't think Tom will be doing that with Mary. 
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it? 
I thought you might walk Mary home. 
Tom said that he hopes that Mary tries to do that. 
You like chocolate, right? 
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning. 
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well. 
Tom hasn't told me where he's planning to stay in Boston. 
Tom didn't need to come here. He could've just called. 
They said that they enjoyed the challenge. 
I know Tom was late. 
Tom told me he was going home. 
Tom told me that he had lost his textbook. 
Nobody knew that Tom was going to do that. 
That's right! 
I thought I might need to do that. 
I'm fairly certain that Tom doesn't have any siblings. 
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that. 
I suspect that's not going to happen. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth. 
Do all of you think that this is a good idea? 
It must have been broken during shipping. 
They said that they might not win. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was a good cook. 
They haven't admitted that they did that yet. 
Everybody except Tom knew that he didn't have to go to Boston. 
I knew that Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday. 
I know that Tom is someone that we can trust. 
If I could've spoken French better, I might've gotten that job. 
Are you feeling OK today? 
Tom and Mary said they'd be able to do that. 
These turtles are not native to California. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't want to go to Boston. 
They said that they're Canadian. 
I know you feel grateful. 
I know that Tom is a prison guard. 
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John is asking her to do. 
Tom said that he hoped he'd be able to buy what he needed for $300. 
Tom said that Mary thought she was the only one who had to do that. 
Both Tom and Mary joined the army when they were eighteen. 
I knew that Tom knew who did that for Mary. 
Ya hafta smell the roses. 
Tom said he didn't like dogs. 
Tom told me he thinks he'll win tomorrow. 
I am really tired of living. 
Tom thought Mary's dress wasn't appropriate for the occasion. 
Do you have children? 
Tom said that he's glad that he didn't do that. 
I wonder whether Tom is really finished. 
I don't think anybody can do this. 
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that? 
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive. 
I'll come back. 
I don't think Tom is nosy. 
I would've never done that. 
I believe that we do not in fact need to do this. 
Tom could've been quicker at doing that than Mary if he'd tried harder. 
I knew that Tom told Mary that he wasn't going to do that. 
In my opinion, you are wrong. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was deaf. 
I don't think I'll go out today because it's quite cold. 
Tom certainly made it clear that he didn't want Mary to attend the party. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do this. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't forgotten to buy Mary a birthday present. 
I wonder whether Tom would like to play poker with us. 
I don't think anybody can do that. 
I thought we'd already been over all this. 
I know that Tom is a lot smarter than I am. 
Tom said that he isn't sure Mary should do that. 
I don't think Tom is interested in going to Boston with us. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was a good cook. 
Tom felt somebody touch his shoulder. 
I know that Tom isn't a history teacher. I think that he's a science teacher. 
Who did Tom plan to stay with? 
Tom assumed that everybody knew what to do. 
Someone stole my lunch. 
I know that Tom won't tell Mary why he's going to do that. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary needed to do that. 
Tom knows nothing about the plan. 
Tom told me he had a few things to take care of. 
I didn't know I didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done. 
Tom said he knew that Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom told me he'd be busy on Monday. 
I didn't want to wake up the kids. 
I know that I'll be arrested. 
That's more like it! 
I think that you could've done this by yourselves. 
Did you know Tom wouldn't win? 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was in danger. 
I didn't think anybody could do this. 
How do we know you're not lying to us? 
I think that you'd all agree Tom is one of our best singers. 
Tom didn't know that Mary was in pain. 
I'd have gone to Boston if I could've. 
You were planning to take pictures, weren't you? 
I don't think Tom knows what he has to buy. 
He is happy. 
Tom said he knew Mary was having a good time in Boston. 
The gods are pleased by your actions. 
I don't feel very well. 
I thought it would be hard to do that. 
I suspect Tom isn't eager to do that. 
I'm convinced that Tom didn't do anything wrong. 
I know that Tom won't need to do that anymore. 
Tom said Mary was happy that he didn't do that. 
You're not a city girl, are you? 
They said that they'll be there. 
Heaven knows we've done everything we can. 
I think Tom will want to see this. 
Why does everyone think Tom and I are stupid? 
Life's not fair. 
You should've seen the look on Tom's face when I told him about what Mary did. 
Tom couldn't get off his socks. 
I don't think Tom can win. 
I think Tom didn't see me yesterday. 
What makes you think that I am lying? 
A stone is heavy on its own turf. 
Tom has already decided that he's not going to stay here. 
I'll make you a sandwich if you want one. 
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there. 
Tom said he was really glad you were able do that. 
You're not going to give up, are you? 
Tom said he wouldn't walk home today. 
Most people think they're above average. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was ticklish. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be gone by the time we get there. 
He went to America last year to brush up his English. 
Tom said Mary probably won't do that. 
Tom will unlikely want to do that on a day like this. 
Tom never mentioned he had a girlfriend. 
I knew that Tom wasn't a very good singer. 
I didn't know you knew French. 
Tom said he wants to change that. 
Why didn't you just say you didn't want to do that? 
It is good that you do not have to study so hard. 
I don't think Tom should sing. 
I wonder whether Tom can help us. 
Tom told me that he was not at all interested in going to the museum with us. 
Tom has a lot of toys. 
I know that Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday. 
Tom and Mary say they don't know when John is planning to do that. 
Tom said he found something strange. 
Tom and I both got out of the car. 
I think Tom will agree. 
Tom said he didn't speak French. 
They said that they lost their key. 
Tom said he could do it. 
Tom isn't going to be home until 2:30. 
He can understand everything I'm saying. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was in her bedroom studying. 
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do that by herself. 
No one but you could have done it this well. 
Tom told me that he was impressed. 
What's happening there? 
I know that Tom won't do that tomorrow. 
I don't think that Tom has done that as many times as Mary has. 
They said that they felt tempted to do that. 
The atomic number of iron is 26. 
Is this the first time you've ever ice skated? 
You better go get dressed. 
It's a complete disaster. 
They say that they aren't having any fun. 
I wish that I had gone to Australia with Tom. 
You aren't answering me. 
I didn't think Tom would help me do that. 
Both Tom and Mary need this. 
Tom thought Mary probably did that. 
I thought I might have to do that. 
Do Tom and Mary know that you've done that? 
Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that. 
Tom thinks I'm a loser. 
Tom knows that he should do that soon. 
Tom thinks that Mary will leave. 
I think Tom didn't expect to be here for so long. 
They told me that they're well. 
Tom is one of the strangest guys that I know. 
I won't tell anybody that you were here. 
Tom said he can speak French, but he can't really speak it. 
Do you think Tom knew that was going to happen? 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't spanked his son so hard. 
I know that Tom is a clever kid. 
How much longer to you think I need to stay in Boston? 
Tom and his wife don't have any children. 
Tom said he knew that Mary couldn't do that. 
I don't think I did as well as the teacher expected me to. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was too slow. 
It's not like you have anything else to do. 
I hope that I haven't gotten you in any trouble. 
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were bored. 
I knew Tom would be annoyed. 
Tom said I looked unhappy. 
Tom thinks that Mary isn't the one who did that. 
I don't think Tom and Mary will ever get married. 
They said that they felt amazing. 
Tom and Mary say they can afford it. 
The museum is not open on Monday. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was stubborn. 
I thought we talked about this already. 
Tom admitted that he let Mary win. 
Tom said he was glad you did that. 
I know that Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that. 
Tom didn't realize that Mary was waiting for him. 
Tom's the only person in our office who doesn't speak French. 
This is so bad, it's good. 
Tom and Mary have both decided to stay. 
It appears to me you're mistaken. 
I thought you'd laugh. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that he shouldn't be doing that. 
They said that the explosion woke them up. 
I didn't know that you weren't planning to do that with Tom. 
Tom thought Mary was homesick. 
They say that they enjoy teaching French. 
Tom didn't tell anybody that he needed to do that. 
Tom said he's not sleepy. 
I thought Tom had paid Mary, but apparently I was wrong. 
Please wake me up at six tomorrow morning. 
I wonder why Tom gave me this. 
Where's my beer? 
I wonder whether Tom told Mary she shouldn't do that. 
I can't believe Tom would do such a thing. 
Tom said the Mary's accident wasn't his fault. 
Tom thought it was a dumb question. 
Tom said he wasn't ready to talk. 
No one knew that. 
I don't think I'll be able to eat all this. 
Tom said doing that may cause problems. 
Everyone's doing well. 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was glad that that was going to happen. 
Tom said he was forced to do that. 
Tom became bored. 
I only bought about half the things I needed to buy. 
Tom told me he wasn't discouraged. 
I want to believe there's still a chance for us to be happy together. 
You're not fooling anybody. 
He doesn't want to live in a less developed country. 
I didn't know that Tom liked to cook. 
Tom thinks there's a chance that Mary won't be at the meeting. 
You aren't in trouble, are you? 
Tom doesn't think Mary is glad that that's going to happen. 
I don't trust anyone but myself. 
I don't think Tom will be ready to do that. 
I know that Tom and Mary don't usually take vacations together. 
I'll eat it. 
I don't think everybody gave up. 
I figured that everybody was busy. 
Tom knows Mary won't cry. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be jealous. 
I'm not planning to do that again. 
The boss said that we are fired. 
You stay here. Everyone else go outside. 
I know Tom will be prudent. 
I think Tom didn't want to leave so early. 
Leave the dog outside! 
Tom said Mary was likely to be pessimistic. 
I suspected that Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted. 
Tom may be the last one to do that. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that I won't be able to do that. 
They said that they would write to us. 
Tom and Mary said they were artists. 
Tom's the only one who wasn't at Mary's party. 
Mary told me that she'd left her husband. 
Tom told me he couldn't walk. 
You have really long hair. 
Tom is still learning everyone's name. 
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that. 
I don't think that it's anyone's fault. 
Tom can swim much better than me. 
Have you already got plans for New Year's Eve? 
Tom said he knew he might have to do that. 
I thought that you said that no one was going to be here. 
I'm sure that Tom will know the answer. 
Tom told everyone that he was depressed. 
It's a good thing that Tom did that. 
That's MY line! 
Tom's parents told him that they thought he was too young to get married. 
Tom said he thought he'd find another job. 
Tom said no one else was hungry. 
I doubt that Tom is still single. 
Tom told everybody he was thirsty. 
I don't think we should stay at the same hotel where we stayed last time. 
Did you even know that his name was Tom? 
I should've kissed Mary. 
I thought that you said you've seen Tom do that. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might want to do that this evening. 
It must have been a shock to you. 
Tom and I were both wrong. 
All of our blood goes through our kidneys about sixty times a day. 
I don't think that doing that's a bad idea. 
She pressed her nose against the glass. 
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was happy. 
We should've gone to Boston last month. 
Tom ought to do that somewhere else. 
I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary. 
I need a doctor! 
Tom thought it wasn't the first time Mary had done that. 
I don't think it's good. 
It is marvelous. 
I wonder whether Tom is really planning to quit his job. 
If I could prove that Tom did that, I'd fire him. 
I eat sushi every chance I get. 
I will never violate a law again. 
I don't think I'll be able to convince Tom to stop doing that. 
Tom didn't tell anyone who he was. 
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be the first one to do that. 
I thought Tom lived in Boston. 
Tom said that he knew Mary wasn't happy. 
Tom said that he wished he'd spent more money on the gift he'd given Mary. 
I don't think it was fair. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still safe. 
I don't think we're going to do that until next week. 
Tom and I both need new shoes. 
Tom said that he would help me. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are married. 
Mary told Tom what she was planning on doing. 
Tom said he'd consider my idea. 
Tom is convinced that Mary is innocent. 
I'm sorry I forgot to tell Tom what to do. 
Tom said Mary was planning to do that by herself. 
Mary wore an ankle bracelet. 
Mary tried on her wedding dress. 
They told me that they were happy here. 
I think Tom wouldn't be amused by what's going on. 
I know that Tom is a lot like John. 
Tom should've let his children come camping with us. 
I wonder whether Tom's friends would help him. 
How did you know I used to do that? 
Tom said Mary wasn't having fun. 
Tom thought Mary was unimpressed. 
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to do that. 
Tom had planned to do that yesterday. 
Tom promised he'd go to Australia with Mary in October. 
I know that Tom is a little crazy. 
I know that Tom will probably not help Mary do that. 
I'm sorry I have kept you waiting so long. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that. 
I thought I'd go with Tom. 
It's marvellous. 
I wonder if Tom is frightened. 
Tom said no one else was hungry. 
They say that they used to study French. 
I'm a doctor. 
It's not like I was trying to avoid Tom. 
I don't think Tom knows Mary can do that. 
Tom told me that his father was a teacher, too. 
The decision is not yet final. 
I knew that Tom knew who had to do that. 
Tom admitted he despised Mary. 
I didn't know Tom lived in the dormitory. 
I'm pretty sure Tom is right. 
I think Tom did what he said he did. 
Tom is not the one who borrowed my car. 
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't have to do that. 
I forgot to buy Tom a present. 
Tom said he wanted to change out of his wet clothes into something dry. 
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she ought to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be frightened by that. 
Tom told me that he thought it would rain all day. 
Have you heard the latest rumours? 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was unbeatable. 
Everyone here except you is from Australia. 
I think Tom is here already. 
I won't be able to come in to work today because I have to take my son to the hospital. 
Is that your car? 
Tom is looking for someone to teach French to his children. 
Tom said he doesn't have enough time to do that. 
Go and see if Mr Wilson is at home. 
I think Tom is fair. 
I didn't know that Tom told Mary that he wasn't going to do that. 
Tom must've been hungry. 
Tom and Mary should've told John that they were married. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was a good cook. 
Red, yellow, and blue are colors. 
I know that Tom is a good drummer. 
Tom thinks Mary was in Australia. 
It's not just Tom's fault. 
I know that Tom isn't a very bright guy. 
With a little more effort, Tom would've succeeded. 
I should've done this months ago. 
This bridge is built of stone. 
I didn't know that Tom knew why Mary kept doing that. 
There's no doubt. 
I know I made a mistake, but you needn't to rub it in! 
Tom is the best. 
I don't think Tom will mind. 
Both Tom and Mary are afraid of John's dog. 
I assumed Tom would want to do that. 
Mary knows that she's attractive. 
I thought Tom would be more cooperative. 
I'm afraid Tom won't be able to come. 
"Let me alone," she said angrily. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny. 
I should have told you about this earlier. 
I know you must be terrified. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary used to live in Boston. 
Tom and Mary say they're not happy here. 
You should've been a little more polite. 
Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that. 
I wish that I were as good at talking to girls as Tom is. 
I knew something wasn't right. 
I know that Tom is going to want to do that. 
We will take part in the marathon. 
Tom is a germaphobe. 
I don't think anybody will like Tom. 
You had best follow the doctor's advice. 
Tom said he thought Mary was difficult to get along with. 
I think Tom is annoyed. 
Tell Tom he should visit Australia. 
Tom and Mary said they felt disappointed. 
I still make a lot of mistakes. 
He walks a lot. 
I didn't think Tom would ever forgive Mary for doing that. 
Tom has a car, but he seldom uses it. 
Let's go out for some ramen. 
I am convinced that I am right. 
Tom told me that I'm last. 
Tom might not be willing to do that for you. 
I thought that you said you'd rather not do that. 
I wonder whether Tom could help us solve this problem. 
I don't know if Tom and Mary still live in Boston or not 
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever do that. 
I hope Tom is coming to Australia with you. 
Water freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade. 
The bread I bought at the supermarket doesn't taste very good. 
In Japan, the new school year starts in April. 
I doubt that Tom is still upset. 
That's not what Tom and I are afraid of. 
I thought Tom was overreacting. 
He is busier than Taro. 
No one tried to do that. 
I know that Tom is a talkative person. 
They cannot stop her. 
Tom said his parents allow him to do what he wants to do. 
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a child? 
I wonder whether Tom knew that Mary had to do that or not. 
I think Tom didn't understand your explanation. 
Tom said doing that would be OK. 
I doubt Tom will be offended. 
I don't think Tom was married at that time. 
Tom said he wasn't likely to do that today. 
I wish I could've helped Tom. 
Tom told everybody he was lonely. 
It seemed that there was no one in the village. 
What's your favorite fruit? 
To get to the source, you have to swim against the tide. 
I know that Tom is a better French speaker than Mary is. 
I thought it was Tom, but it was John. 
What is happening? 
Tom said he thought he could pass the test. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would do that on purpose. 
I hope you get the chance to do that. 
Tom lent me a lot of money. 
I wish I could have spoken French. 
Tom told me he did that for us. 
Tom likes to play with this dog. 
I am wasting my time. 
Tom said Mary ought to do that in the other room. 
I should've advised Tom not to believe what Mary says. 
I think that Tom hasn't left yet. 
I've already said that I'll do that. 
Remember that we are all in the same boat. 
I wonder whether we forgot to tell Tom to do that. 
You are a genius. 
Tom and Mary think that they might have the answer. 
I think Tom may have done this. 
Tom said he hasn't decided what needs to be done. 
Tom said he liked the movie. 
French isn't my native language. 
I don't think Tom and Mary really plan to do that this week. 
I must've fainted. 
Tom didn't know you weren't supposed to do that by yourself. 
I wish I didn't have to go to work today. 
Tom told me that Mary got married last month. 
Tom promised to pay Mary three hundred dollars to babysit his kids for the weekend. 
You startled me! 
Tom told me that he'd be careful. 
Tom and Mary said they're taught French before. 
Tom said that Mary wasn't planning to go anywhere. 
I have to leave now. 
I knew that Tom knew why Mary didn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might be required to do that right away. 
Tom and Mary told me that they weren't feeling very good. 
I think that Tom is on vacation. 
I know I saw something move. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't planning on doing that tomorrow. 
I knew that Tom wasn't the only one who did that. 
I think we had better wait another thirty minutes. 
I didn't know that Tom knew anybody who was able to do that. 
I should've known Tom and Mary would be together. 
Tom told me that he and Mary spent their summer vacation at the beach. 
Everybody but Tom knew that Mary was in love with him. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are able to do that. 
They're wrong. 
I don't think Tom would have fun doing that. 
They said that they knew that I was coming. 
I don't want to be here any more than you do. 
Is Tom planning to stay at home all day by himself? 
I know that Tom will be quicker at doing that than Mary. 
I know that Tom is a snob. 
I'm not sure I need to do that. 
I cannot accept this gift. 
Tom and Mary have both decided to move to Boston. 
Tom and Mary said they were thirty. 
It's time to reflect on your past. 
Tom didn't think he would make it. 
Tom and Mary said they don't plan to do that anymore. 
I know that Tom is a good actor. 
Tom's innocent. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was terrific. 
I don't think that's necessary yet. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was responsible for what had happened. 
Tom said that he thought that I had to do that. 
Tom told me he didn't have any enemies. 
Tom said he didn't know how to swim very well. 
Tom said he might do that. 
I'm absolutely certain that this is where I parked my car. 
I thought you were planning to be here earlier. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary will get divorced. 
Tom told me he came from a large family. 
Tom said he didn't think Mary would like his friends. 
Tom says he hopes Mary knows he doesn't want to do that. 
Tom said he was planning to go to Boston next summer. 
I think Tom has forgotten how to do that. 
Tom said he knew Mary might be permitted to do that by herself. 
I know you must be hungry. 
You know I'm older than you are. 
Tom and Mary have allowed their kids to do that many times. 
I thought it might be cocaine, but it was only flour. 
I told Tom you were busy. 
You may not be able to do that. 
Tom will be very upset if that happens. 
I wish I were better at French. 
Tom says that he has some paperwork that needs to be done. 
Tom isn't scared of anyone. 
They aren't sure that they want to do this. 
Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to do that again. 
Where's my money? 
Tom and Mary said they hoped they'd be able to buy what they needed for $300. 
I know that I'm annoying. 
Tom would've been here if he could've. 
I know that Tom is the only one who can't do that. 
Something's happened to her. 
I am often confused with my brother. 
I knew that Tom wasn't afraid of Mary's dog. 
I figured Tom would mess up again. 
I wonder whether or not Tom likes doing that. 
I would've done anything in the world to help Tom. 
Tom gave Mary some roses. 
Tom said that he thought that I wanted to do that. 
I know I didn't do that the way you told me to. 
Tom said he didn't know any better. 
Their car overtook ours. 
Mary says she isn't planning on doing that tomorrow. 
You are watching. 
Tom says he knows Mary won't want to go sailing unless he goes sailing with her. 
Tom told me he did nothing wrong. 
I'm sure that Tom should do that again. 
Tom told me that he thought that he wouldn't be able to do that. 
They said that they tried to win. 
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were fine. 
I thought that Mary said she didn't have a boyfriend. 
We must always be prepared for disasters. 
I know that you're eager to do that. 
I thought you said you hated Tom. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30. 
Now you mention it, I can smell it, as well. 
Are you suggesting that I am lying? 
Tom talked to Mary as well. 
Tom said Mary wasn't desperate. 
I don't think Tom knows who's going to help Mary do that. 
You have confused the students. 
I suspect Tom will come to Boston. 
It's not safe to drink this water. 
I know you don't know how to speak French. 
You could've warned me. 
Mr Tatuya deals in grain. 
I'm almost certain that that's not the case. 
Tom told me that he's not going to do that. 
I think we can change that. 
I want to know that what I'm doing is right. 
Tom said I should've stayed and helped Mary. 
It was not a pleasant experience. 
Tom said he couldn't remember anything. 
I am familiar with the way he asks questions. 
I know that Tom isn't handsome, but I wouldn't say that he's ugly. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly. 
I don't think I really have to do that again. 
The police are going to catch you eventually. 
He cannot answer their questions. 
I know Tom was amused by what was going on. 
I think that Tom will eventually give up and let someone else do it. 
Tom said he got out of the way. 
Tom said that he knew Mary wouldn't be able to do that. 
I'm European. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary seemed depressed. 
Tom said I looked busy. 
I don't think Tom noticed we were there. 
It's not as crazy as it sounds. 
Tom said he hadn't intended to stay so long. 
I'm not sure I'd be much help. 
I thought you were supposed to be in Australia this week. 
I don't think Tom was late. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be sympathetic. 
They showed their photo albums to us. 
I guess that you can't do it. 
Tom knew that Mary was going to yell at him. 
Tom said that he didn't think that it would be possible to do that. 
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that. 
Tom and Mary told me they had to do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't hungry. 
I doubt that Tom will try to do that. 
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needed to do that this morning. 
I thought Tom was interested in golf. 
Where did you get those shoes? 
I think something's wrong. 
My brother is now in Australia. 
I think that Tom's plan is better than Mary's. 
I need to get some shut-eye. 
I'm an introvert. 
I should've never come to Boston. 
Tom said he'd try to convince Mary to do that. 
You aren't helping a lot. 
I knew that Tom was already finished doing that. 
I thought you were teaching Tom French. 
They said that they'd think about it. 
Tom said he knew Mary might be permitted to do that in the near future. 
Tom left about thirty minutes ago. 
Tom said that he was glad Mary could do that. 
I'm a high school graduate so I am that much able to answer high school problems and such. 
I wonder whether Tom is downstairs. 
I know Tom will do whatever you ask. 
I know that you're not stupid enough to believe that. 
Tom said he wondered if Mary and I'd really be able to do that by ourselves. 
Tom should've refused to leave early. 
I didn't know that Tom was the kind of guy who would do that kind of thing. 
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she ought to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would be fired. 
Tom didn't know somebody wanted to kill him. 
Tom will be here for another three days. 
Tom hardly ever does that anymore. 
I suspect Tom is optimistic. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was unmarried. 
I'm sure I can overcome any difficulty. 
I don't think you need to tell Tom what he needs to do. 
They knew that they ought to do that. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom can help Mary. 
I know you did this. 
I am very worried about my future. 
How could anyone do that to a child? 
I know that Tom knows we don't need to do that. 
I know that Tom doesn't know why he has to do that by himself. 
That is not exactly the way that it happened. 
They told me that they were certain. 
Tom said that he didn't think that doing that would be much fun. 
Tom thinks Mary always packs way too much in her suitcase. 
I know that Tom can do that better than Mary. 
My heart's aching. 
Tom has decided that he's not going to stay here. 
Tom and Mary agreed to be here at 2:30, but they're not here yet. 
Who was this done by? 
I knew that Tom would be annoyed if you did that. 
They claimed that they didn't cry. 
You know Tom is very unlikely to do that, don't you? 
Tom said that he didn't think that he had enough time to do that today. 
I've done everything I've been asked to do. 
I know that someone has to do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was the first one to do that. 
I know that Tom is a bit old fashioned. 
I know that Tom will be doing that with me. 
I wonder whether we'll be all right. 
I thought it wouldn't rain today. 
Tom and Mary told me that they're depressed. 
It's not something anyone would be ashamed of. 
I should have thought of that earlier. 
Is there anything else you want to know? 
Tom said he was glad you were able to do that when you were in Australia. 
I'm against the death penalty. 
What're we doing here? 
I forgot to tell Tom I intended to do that. 
I would have written a longer letter if I'd had more time. 
I didn't know that Tom would care if you did that. 
I cannot give you a definite answer today. 
I don't think Tom would ever be able to do that. 
I knew that Tom was a little under the weather. 
I think Tom won't go. 
Tom may need to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they were hungry. 
I don't think I would've had the courage to do that. 
They thought that they were going to be busy. 
I should've been truthful. 
I know that Tom knows that I didn't need to do that. 
I have no doubt in my mind you are the woman I'm going to marry. 
He hasn't got a mobile phone. 
I don't think Tom is going to help us do that. 
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't do that again. 
Who else knows I'm here? 
Tom and Mary said they'd love to help. 
I haven't told anybody else yet. 
You know Tom doesn't like that. 
They say that they're Canadians. 
I don't think you're going to be able to do that. 
I think Tom can swim better than Mary. 
I'm not going to let you do that. 
Tom told me he didn't have time to do that. 
Someone must've poisoned Tom. 
I know that Tom knows I don't want to do that. 
I remember it! 
I bike to work. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be reasonable. 
Tom said that Mary knew that he might be allowed to do that by himself. 
I know that Mary loves me. 
I've enjoyed talking to you. 
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that with Tom. 
Tom said he really enjoyed the concert. 
I promise I'll try. 
Tom said that Mary knew she might need to do that. 
Tom said he wanted to live in a cave. 
Tom said Mary isn't suspicious. 
Tom knew he wouldn't be arrested. 
Both Tom and Mary looked back at John. 
I didn't know that I needed to do that today. 
Tom says that he knows a good Chinese restaurant that we can go to. 
I know that Tom isn't a history teacher. I think he teaches science. 
Tom said he saw the invisible man today. 
Tom realized that with a broken leg it was going to be hard to get back to the camp. 
I knew Tom would eventually leave. 
Tom thinks Mary won't have to do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might be tempted to do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they weren't scared. 
Tom and Mary said they're not happy. 
Tom told me he planned to wait until Monday to do that. 
She has never fallen in love. 
Tom may be ticklish. 
Tom says he's not planning on staying here all winter. 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be cooperative. 
Tom thought it would be fun. 
I don't eat as much as you. 
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us. 
Tom said he has to wait for Mary. 
Tom tried to do that, but couldn't. 
Tom didn't want anybody to be sad. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be upset if he did that. 
We've finished. 
I know Tom misses you. 
I don't think Tom could get Mary to do that. 
Tom said that he'd give a book to Mary. 
Tom said he isn't happy. 
Tom must've forgotten to tell Mary that. 
I think Tom is talented. 
Someone had to do that. 
I think Tom and Mary are both crazy. 
I wonder whether Tom is pleased. 
Tom's house was consumed by fire. 
I don't think I enjoy doing this as much as you seem to. 
You still plan to do that, don't you? 
You should've asked Tom why he did that. 
They said that they needed our help. 
Tom told me that I was beautiful. 
The city was blanketed with snow.

How did you know I was going to say that? 
I don't think Tom knows anybody in Boston. 
Does Tom really think Mary enjoys doing that? 
I haven't eaten anything for the last three days. 
I thought that you said no one was going to be here. 
We haven't yet been told. 
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be interested in doing that. 
Mary says she doesn't plan on doing that this week. 
Tom said Mary should go. 
She is my favorite character. 
Tom said that he knew you couldn't do that. 
They said that they didn't want to leave. 
I wish I could speak English as fluently as you! 
Tom couldn't find a bottle opener, so he tried opening the bottle with his teeth. 
That book helps you to write effectively. 
I can't stand that man. 
I have irrational desires. 
Tom said Mary should've stayed in Australia all summer. 
I'm afraid I have bad news. 
I wish you hadn't told me that. 
They told me that they'd be back. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be ready by the time we got there. 
Tom should've helped Mary. 
They said that they'd be willing to do that. 
I think that there's a possibility that Tom won't want to do that. 
Tom is not a very friendly guy. 
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not. 
I'm not sure Tom would want me to give you that. 
I wish we hadn't gone to Australia. 
They say that they also want to do that. 
Tom and Mary took their gloves off. 
We are apt to make mistakes. 
I know that Tom didn't know exactly how to do that. 
Tom said that that didn't sound logical to him. 
They told everyone that they were lonely. 
We've got to escape this place. 
Tom would've liked to be here. 
You should have worked harder. 
I'm surprised Tom didn't show. 
I wonder whether or not Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that. 
I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth. 
Tom told everyone that he was fine. 
I'm sure Tom would do that if you asked him. 
I don't think Tom knows how much time that's going to take. 
Tom thinks Mary lacks common sense. 
They don't know that I wish they'd leave. 
I wonder whether Tom asked Mary to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary had been impolite. 
What is the matter with you? 
Tom told me that Mary was the one who did that. 
Tom told me that he's decided not to eat any more junk food. 
Tom could not afford to pay for his mother's funeral. 
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom could speak French. 
It's not OK to smoke here. 
I am your friend, right? 
Has anyone told Tom? 
Tom said he wanted Mary to do that by herself. 
Let's celebrate! 
Tom told Mary he thought John was in Australia. 
Tom told everyone that he was discouraged. 
You should've told Tom about it while he was here. 
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be courteous. 
Can you think of anyone who would've wanted to kill Tom? 
Tom said that he thought he could do that for me. 
I thought you said you enjoyed doing that. 
You could have drowned. 
Tom told Mary that he was glad that that was going to happen. 
We really need more American slang on Tatoeba, stat! 
Tom said that he didn't believe that Mary really planned on going with us. 
I know that Tom would've done that for me. 
I don't think the weather will clear up anytime soon. 
Tom and I both like swimming. 
Tom said he didn't want to go to the dance with Mary. 
Tom said the pain started three months ago. 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be gone by the time we get there. 
Tom pretended he didn't notice that Mary was staring at him. 
Tom thought he had to help Mary. 
I am going to New York next week. 
This is an unusually difficult language. 
They realized that they needed to do that. 
I'm sure Tom needs to do that again. 
Tom must've been tortured. 
Last night I puked. 
Everyone here except me has done that. 
Tom is almost as tall as Mary is. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was upset. 
We need to protect our children. 
I assume you've proofread this already. 
I don't think you ought to do that until this afternoon. 
Tom said that he hoped that Mary would like the gift he was planning on giving her. 
I thought Tom didn't like you. 
I was surprised that Tom didn't need to do the same thing I needed to do. 
I thought that Tom was likely to win. 
I cannot help laughing at him. 
I don't think I really have to do that. 
I know that Tom is a heavy sleeper. 
I think Tom will call you. 
It was the first time that I visited the museum. 
Tom said that he hopes Mary won't let John drive. 
What are you going to do with all that money? 
Why are you planning on doing that? 
I'm sorry I couldn't get to you sooner. 
Terrific! 
We're sorry that it happened. 
I didn't notice that Tom was doing that. 
Tom is about three years older than Mary. 
It's important we do that correctly. 
I think Tom is only pretending to be asleep. 
I promise I won't cry. 
Tom said that he thought that I might not be required to do that by myself. 
I suspect Tom is frustrated. 
Tom and Mary told me that they needed some cash. 
I always knew Tom could win. 
You are welcome. 
Tom showed his stamp collection to me. 
We are here. 
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French. 
What you said does not make sense. 
They told me that they'll join us later. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are going to hate this. 
Tom said he wished that Mary and I wouldn't go out after dark by ourselves. 
We could not see the top of the mountain. 
They told me that they'll be back soon. 
You should've been able to do that without Tom's help. 
Somebody is waiting for us in the lobby. 
I knew that Tom was planning to tell Mary to do that. 
I've lost three kilos. 
The same thing must've happened to Tom. 
I know Tom is almost as tall as I am. 
Tom didn't read everything as carefully as he should have. 
We know that Tom is unlikely to do that. 
I knew Tom went to this school. 
I'm afraid we'll have to start over again. 
I'm so sorry this has happened. 
That is an interesting claim. 
You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you? 
I am familiar with this subject. 
I don't think that anyone really thought that Tom was as rich as he said he was. 
She's not old enough to get a driver's license. 
His dream has become a reality. 
They promised that they'd do that tomorrow. 
I think that both Tom and Mary were born in Australia. 
Why do you think that Tom would do such a thing? 
I may go out if the rain lets up. 
I don't think Tom enjoys hiking. 
Tom could've been present at today's meeting, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't. 
Tom and Mary say they'll never give up. 
It may not be as hard to do that as you think it'll be. 
Kids, listen! 
They say that they have no vices. 
No one in my family is a musician. 
Tom admitted he was weak. 
Tom said he's glad you were able to do that when you were in Boston. 
Tom and Mary think they know what to do. 
I don't think it's a good idea. 
I know that Tom is picky. 
The wound has not healed yet. 
I don't think Tom knows anyone who's able to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would do that. 
I'm not sure I want to do this. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was the last one to do that. 
I should have paid more attention in biology class. 
Tom said he thought he was too young to do that. 
You're not taking it, are you? 
Is there somewhere we can talk privately about this? 
I guess I could try. 
They're not like people say they are. 
I don't think I'll be busy next week. 
I don't think I'm the person that you're looking for. 
I am far from happy. 
I don't think Tom has any friends living in Boston. 
Both Tom and Mary complained about John. 
I know that you're not serious. 
Tom said he'd never heard of me. 
Tom said he didn't think Mary knew how to drive. 
I never said that! 
Have a great weekend. 
I suspect Tom and Mary have both already left Australia. 
Tom thought it was going to hurt. 
It's not worth much. 
This is real hard. 
Tom is going to be surprised if you don't do that. 
Tom knew Mary was with John. 
I promise I'll be back soon. 
Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long. 
They put their boots on. 
I thought you came to see Tom. 
This should've been done a long time ago. 
I don't think that it's very likely Tom will come over this time of night. 
I do not mince words. 
Tom said that he thought that he'd have to do that tomorrow. 
Tom should've done that weeks ago. 
Mary said she wasn't planning on going. 
Tom told Mary that she should go home. 
I think Tom is still motivated. 
I should've kept going. 
I thought Tom was hungry. 
Tom thinks that if he had tried a little harder, he could've won the race. 
Tom's lawyer was not surprised when the jury found him not guilty. 
What's the real reason Tom didn't want to buy that? 
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew that he'd been arrested. 
It's not something that I'm very good at. 
I thought it was true. 
So valuable were the books that they were handled with the greatest care. 
You should've declined the invitation. 
I didn't know that Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that. 
I know that Tom is a teacher here. 
Tom thought he'd forgotten to tell Mary what to do. 
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't pleased. 
I understand nobody wants to help us. 
Tom and Mary told me that they thought I should lose some weight. 
I know you don't know either. 
If you want this pen, I will lend it to you. 
I know that Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that. 
I think it would be difficult to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought you could do that. 
Tom doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that. 
I know that Tom is a bit taller than I am. 
I don't remember! 
I should've been a movie star. 
Tom said that he hopes you won't go home by yourself. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary used to play lead guitar in John's band. 
If it were possible, someone would've done it by now. 
I think Tom still needs to do that. 
Tom said he didn't need your permission to do that. 
Tom's eating. 
Tom said Mary was willing to help you. 
I know that Tom is more handsome than me. 
Tom and Mary said they're glad to help. 
Tom knew that he'd be busy on October 20th. 
I think that I can do that better than you can. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are worried. 
Tom and Mary said they couldn't wait. 
Tom said the team remains confident. 
I wonder whether Tom wanted to sing. 
I don't think Tom is unconscious. 
I know that Tom isn't able to play the guitar. 
Tom said that he didn't think that you should ask Mary to do that. 
He's a passive-aggressive teacher. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was in Australia. 
Tom doubts that Mary can swim. 
It's not easy for you, is it? 
Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was. 
Tom knew I was uncomfortable. 
Tom told me that he'll be back soon. 
It's obvious Tom wants to do that. 
I think it's a risk that anyone would've taken. 
I'm sorry I forced you to do that. 
I thought that you said you'd rather do that yourself. 
Tom said he thought Mary would be scared. 
Tom doesn't want Mary to know that he doesn't know how to do that. 
Tom vehemently denied he'd done that. 
Tom should've told Mary that she was doing that the wrong way. 
Call me! 
You should've told Tom how you felt. 
We will consider your suggestion. 
Eating too much is bad for the health. 
The paint's drying. 
Tom may be lost. 
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is. 
Hi, my name's Tom! 
Tom said he never wanted to get married. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would've done that. 
Tom is still dating the same girl that he was dating three years ago. 
You're not getting away from me that easily, Tom. 
Tom will give us everything we've asked for. 
Tom and Mary said they were supportive. 
You're a drug addict like me! 
I think I don't deserve it. 
I thought Tom wasn't here. 
I'm speechless. 
Tom was surprised Mary didn't do that. 
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary. 
Thank you for coming. 
I doubt Tom will leave anytime soon. 
Both Tom and Mary will go. 
I thought that you said you'd ask Tom to do that. 
Don't hang up! 
I probably sing better than Tom. 
Tom is miserable. 
Didn't you know that there was a good chance that this would happen? 
I wonder whether Tom will be at Mary's party tonight. 
Tom is the only one in our office who doesn't speak French. 
This is not expensive. 
I didn't think I'd ever have a chance to do that. 
I know that that'll be hard to do. 
Tom must've missed something. 
I know somebody had to do that. 
Tom said he hoped he'd be able to win. 
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
It's not a big deal. 
Tom thinks he's in love. 
It isn't necessary for Tom to do that by himself. 
Tom said that Mary has to do that. 
Tom didn't know Mary used to live in Australia. 
I wonder whether Tom still thinks Mary has to do that. 
I'm planning to send Tom a birthday present. 
I don't speak French as fluently as you. 
Tom has given me many things. 
I know that Tom didn't know why you wanted him to do that. 
They said that they weren't sure what to do. 
I should've listened to you. 
Do you have an umbrella I could borrow? 
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind. 
Federer held his serve at love at 2-2. 
We should've studied harder. 
Tom said he'd rather die than do that. 
I think that I'm going to have to tell Tom everything. 
I know that Tom didn't know who didn't have to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom is biased. 
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to do that. 
Mary says she's planning on going tomorrow. 
I must have misunderstood. 
Tom baked Mary a birthday cake. 
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should do that. 
Tom said that he didn't have time to answer all my questions. 
Tom said it should've been simple. 
I don't think Tom knows how badly Mary was hurt. 
I assume we're free to go. 
I don't think anyone saw us. 
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that. 
I don't think anyone could do that. 
Tom has agreed to babysit our children next Monday. 
Tom said he was sure that Mary wouldn't win. 
Tom said he isn't sure Mary can take care of herself. 
Tom lived in Australia for three years when he was a kid. 
I doubt that Tom really plans on doing that this week. 
Is it true that Tom tried to hang himself? 
Who are you calling stupid?! 
I am calling my brother. 
There's a good chance Tom will do that for us. 
I knew Tom wouldn't hurt me. 
Tom was not being completely honest. 
You could have just told me. 
Tom was only pretending he didn't understand French. 
Tom said Mary was willing to do that for you. 
I thought that was interesting. 
Tom's grieving. 
Tom told me he won't be in Boston next week. 
Tom let me know he was planning to stay in Australia for three weeks. 
Tom and Mary said they've always done that. 
I can't do it! 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary will do this evening. 
I know that Tom knew why you didn't do that. 
There's no hot water. 
I like such fruits as grapes and peaches. 
Tom plans to stay with us when he comes to Boston. 
I don't think you need to tell Tom what Mary did. 
Tom thought it over for several days. 
Tom works at a store not too far from where he lives. 
You are very brave. 
Tom said he understands why Mary might not want to do that. 
Forget it. 
Tom said more than he should have. 
I thought Tom wouldn't like the book Mary gave him. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wouldn't be doing that today. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary didn't want to do that. 
I hope that things stay peaceful. 
I can rip you apart with my bare hands. 
I thought that Tom might be angry at you. 
I don't think Tom is Mary's boyfriend. 
Tom said he thought he should do that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they're safe. 
Tom thought he heard his name being called. 
We don't believe that's true. 
This is a song I learned when I was a kid. 
The road is long. 
Tom's a good carpenter. 
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia next Monday. 
It's going to be difficult to do. 
I thought I'd try doing that again. 
Tom will be very disappointed if you don't eat the salad that he made. 
We are both from Boston. 
I don't think that Tom knows that I'm Mary's boyfriend. 
You lied to her! 
I'm not sure, but I think Tom wants to be a teacher. 
I thought it was an exciting story. 
They put their forks down. 
Tom and Mary said that they were really sure that they could do that. 
I think Tom wouldn't like to do that. 
I must have made a mistake. 
Tom told everyone that he'd decided to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning to stay in Boston very long. 
I know that Tom is a really successful musician. 
I didn't think anyone did that. 
I didn't want Tom to know that I wasn't going to do that. 
Both Tom and I need help. 
Are you hungry too? 
I doubt we were ever in any real danger. 
Did you know Tom was going to win? 
They say that they don't think that they snore. 
The doctor said that this ailment is incurable. 
Tom told me he'd do that if I did that, too. 
I knew that Tom would be permitted to do that. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't mean to hurt you. 
I don't think Tom will come to school today. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants him to say. 
Is there any chance you could help me get them? 
Are you sure that's what you want to do? 
I know somebody who can do that for you. 
I thought I heard a mouse in the kitchen. 
I know that Tom wouldn't make Mary do that. 
Tom put on his glasses. 
There is nothing God cannot do. 
Tom said he thought Mary hadn't been impressed. 
I thought about it a lot. 
Tom said that he thought the economy was in bad shape. 
I was living in Boston when I was thirteen. 
How long ago was that? 
I think Tom is lovable. 
I am buying a new car. 
In 1497, John Cabot explored Canada. 
Tom and Mary told me they cried. 
I didn't think Tom was glad that had happened. 
Do you think it'll be hard for you to do that? 
Tom told me he likes doing that. 
I know you're not like that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't going to win. 
I didn't think Tom would be fired for doing that. 
I planned on doing that yesterday. 
Tom knew right away that he shouldn't have said anything. 
Tom and Mary say they'll sing. 
There is a park near my house. 
I'm hoping I'll be given another chance. 
You will know the truth one day. 
Tom told me that he won't come to school tomorrow. 
We found out that Tom was the thief. 
Tom had no desire to return to Boston. 
Mary made her husband breakfast. 
It's not bedtime yet. 
I think Tom might be able to do that. 
I must have forgotten it. 
Know thyself. 
Don't say anything. 
I would have done it at that time. 
Tom and I are both a little busy. 
Tom told me he'd left his wife. 
It's probably going to be hard for Tom to win. 
I knew that Tom was doing that. 
I admitted I didn't do what Tom told me I needed to do. 
They said that they weren't retired. 
Tom says he's not planning on doing that. 
No one else has complained. 
Tom told me Mary was very hungry. 
Tom and Mary think that they understand women. 
I didn't know Tom was trans. 
They say that they're going to beat you up. 
I think you should let Tom know that you can't speak French. 
I knew Tom didn't care about Mary. 
I didn't know Tom had a house in Australia. 
I cannot stand this heat. 
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned. 
I'm just as surprised as everyone else. 
They thought that they were being cute. 
I don't think it matters who does that. 
I didn't know that you were planning to do that today. 
Why's Tom mad at Mary? 
They say that they want something to eat. 
Tom helps anyone who asks him for help. 
I know that Tom is a member. 
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be here. 
That book is very old. 
None of us plan to stay here much longer. 
I know that Tom isn't a dental student. 
I thought you were supposed to doing that right now. 
Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not likely to be fired. 
Tom wanted to keep walking, but Mary insisted they stop and rest. 
I don't think Tom knows how to dance. 
Since it rained, I did not go. 
Tom knows I'm at home. 
Four times two is eight. 
They said that they'd consider doing that. 
Tom said he was asked to help. 
I didn't think Tom would ever speak to me again. 
It's not very windy today. 
Tom won't be here until 2:30. 
Tom is the only one I know who has been to Australia. 
I promise I won't tell anyone what you did. 
They put their swimsuits on. 
Hurry up, Tom. 
You should have spoken more politely. 
If you'd been there, we would've had a good time together. 
Tom said he wasn't happy here. 
I'm at a loss for words. 
Tom and Mary said they like to do that. 
Tom and I are both a little busy right now. 
They said that they felt manipulated. 
I don't think Tom would be motivated to do that. 
Tom said it didn't look like Mary was having a good time. 
Tom told Mary he wasn't interested in doing that. 
You should have at least told Tom and Mary that they didn't need to do that anymore. 
I knew Tom wouldn't cry. 
I think Tom would like to live in Australia. 
I thought I could handle it myself, but I couldn't. 
It's not evening yet. 
Tom assumed that everybody knew that Mary was going to do that. 
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was doing that by herself. 
Tom said he could swim at least as well as Mary. 
That is the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. 
Tom plans to go soon. 
You're not upset, are you? 
Tom said he thought Mary was planning on going to Boston with him. 
Let's go to the park where it is not noisy. 
I think Tom has to do that. 
I thought I wouldn't be gone long. 
Where are you going? 
Tom and Mary said they'd overstayed their visa. 
She dreamed a happy dream last night. 
Both Tom and Mary are very tired. 
I thought both Tom and Mary were under thirty. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't know what to do. 
I have to admit I'm a little anxious. 
Tom dried his hands with the towel that Mary handed him. 
I think Tom's record speaks for itself. 
You have the same rights as everyone else. 
Tom and Mary said they planned on staying where they were. 
Eat whatever you want. 
Tom said he wouldn't try doing that again. 
Tom said that he thought he wouldn't be able to do that until October. 
Tom said Mary is sleepy. 
Tom said he'd never leave early. 
I doubt Tom would be that foolish. 
I'm not sure I can do it. 
I don't think Tom would ever consider doing that. 
How did you know that Tom couldn't do that? 
Tom is not on good terms with his family. 
Tom can see things that Mary can't. 
Tom said that he hoped he could figure out how to do that. 
Both Tom and Mary were silent for a long time. 
I am beginning to remember it. 
If I had the money, I would immediately buy this computer. 
We're already mounting it. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd make it on time. 
I don't think Tom realizes how well Mary can speak French. 
Tom told everyone that he was glad that that was going to happen. 
The price of rice rose by three percent. 
They say that they've been asked to help. 
Tom knows he has no choice. 
Nobody should've died. 
Tom would've done that himself if he'd had known how. 
I hope Tom knows he doesn't need to do that. 
He's piss drunk. 
I would've done that for you if I'd had more time. 
I knew Tom wasn't in Boston. 
Tom said he thought it would be raining on Monday. 
Do you think Tom would like to do that? 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be hesitant to do that. 
They said that they don't work on Mondays. 
I think that Tom is expecting somebody. 
I know Tom is a few pounds lighter than Mary is. 
Tom said he loves that kind of work. 
I know that Tom didn't know who wanted to do that. 
Tom said Mary was mistaken. 
They told me that they needed money. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was planning on going to Australia with him. 
Wait! 
I didn't tell Tom I grew up in Australia. 
Tom did that on purpose. 
I thought Tom had a party last night. 
I know that Tom didn't know that you needed to do that. 
Tom already plans to do that. 
Who's the photographer? 
I knew that Tom was a gun owner, but I didn't know he had so many guns. 
I didn't understand. 
I'm lucky I'm still able to do that. 
They put their phones away. 
I think Tom would've helped us if he'd been there. 
They said that they were thrilled. 
They are doctors. 
Tom and Mary should both have stayed awake. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan on going together. 
They said they were bored. 
Tom could've given me more money. 
I don't think Tom will want to go drinking with us. 
I'll watch television. 
I don't think Tom knows what time the meeting will start. 
Tom and Mary let us know that they wouldn't do that. 
I don't think Tom knows how much money was stolen. 
Tom and Mary are planning on staying in Boston for a few days. 
Keep off the grass. 
Tom and Mary said they felt lonely. 
Tom said we should be patient. 
Is it true Tom used to live in Australia? 
As a rule, we have three meals a day. 
Is it true Tom thinks I believe that? 
I am playing volleyball now. 
They say that they can't help. 
No one knows that Tom hasn't done that. 
I don't think anyone does that. 
Tom said Mary wasn't the one responsible for what happened. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was hungry. 
I thought Tom was with Mary. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't be motivated to do that. 
It could've happened to anyone. 
I know that Tom is alone in his apartment. 
I am a woman. 
You know you did the right thing. 
Tom probably should go home now. 
Tom said Mary was likely to be early. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was well. 
I know that you're not doing that right now. 
We already know you did that. 
I think Tom would be cooperative. 
Tom knows that he has to do something, but he's not sure what. 
I'm sorry Tom thinks that way. 
Tom said that he hoped that he could win the race. 
Tom didn't know that you were planning to stay.

Tom is happy. 
Both Tom and Mary are conservative. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself. 
I am praying. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was satisfied. 
I don't think Tom knows the whole story. 
I don't think Tom even saw me. 
Put on your shirt. 
The same for me. 
I am the first musician in my family. 
Some people say that true love doesn't exist. 
I am not very good at sizing people up quickly. 
Tom told me that I could use his computer. 
The first person I met in Australia was Tom. 
Everybody but Tom knew that he didn't need to stay in Boston. 
Tom and Mary told me they'd look into it. 
They know that Tom means business. 
Tom said Mary knew John might be permitted to do that after his birthday. 
I don't think that was the problem. 
They told me that they felt fine. 
Tom said he really enjoyed dancing with Mary. 
Tom said that isn't the only reason why Mary wants to do that. 
It's unfortunate that that happened. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was downstairs. 
I know that Tom knows that he shouldn't be doing that. 
Tom and Mary are planning on taking pictures tomorrow. 
This man is not my husband. 
Tom said he didn't believe that. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't that I was going to do that. 
Tom must've been very tired when he got home. 
I'm pretty sure Tom can't speak French. 
There's no chance Tom will help us. 
I don't think you can eat that. 
Tom said he'll try to do that. 
I thought it was hilarious. 
Tom works at a store not too far from where he lives. 
I thought that you said you didn't want to talk about it. 
I don't know anybody there except for Tom. 
Tom told me that he was quicker at doing that than Mary. 
I don't think Tom is still upset. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary had been fired. 
It's not a bad plan. 
Did Tom know you were planning on doing that? 
Tom convinced me you were the best person for the job. 
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for him. 
That water isn't cold. 
I think Tom stayed in Boston last summer. 
How anyone could vote for someone like that is beyond me. 
They said that they were busy. 
I know that Tom is in his room packing his suitcase. 
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy you that? 
I don't think that anybody saw us do that. 
Tom said you speak French. 
I should've gone to the dentist last week. 
They told me that they're shy. 
I don't think Tom is adopted. 
I swear I'm not high. 
Tom and Mary gave me their old car. 
Tom said he hadn't seen Mary for a long time. 
Both Tom and I know that you did that. 
Tom told Mary I was broke. 
I know that Tom and Mary have both been sick. 
I can't understand why anyone would want to do that. 
Tom said he's interested in learning how to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do. 
They still hope that they can do that. 
Tom said he jumped out of the way. 
"Was anyone with you?" "No, I was alone." 
Don't pretend you're sorry. I know you're not. 
Tom told everybody that he was reluctant to do that. 
This box is quite heavy! 
I thought that you said that you wanted to go to Boston. 
I met someone yesterday who knows Tom. 
I know you can't get away with this. 
Whenever someone knocks on the door, my dog starts barking. 
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem. 
There's no way that you can do that by yourselves. 
I'm afraid something is wrong with Tom. 
The bill was hard to calculate. 
I want to know who is coming with us. 
I've never met anyone like you before. 
It would've been hard to do that. 
Tom may be ready to do that. 
Tom will try to help Mary do that. 
It could have been worse. 
Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea. 
I regret that I didn't tell Tom the truth. 
Tom and I both didn't go to yesterday's meeting. 
How come you didn't come to the party? 
Do you think Tom is already retired? 
I wonder if Tom still remembers how to do that. 
Didn't you know that Tom used to live Boston? 
I don't think that it'll rain, but I'll take an umbrella in case. 
Tom promised he'd tell us. 
Tom said he thought that there was no need to hurry. 
Both Tom and I are still high school students. 
You're making a big mistake. 
Tom says that he saw a ghost. 
Tom thinks Mary won't be lonely. 
Tom and Mary said they would help. 
Did the umbrella you found belong to Tom?

I think Tom really does hate you. 
I know that Tom will like doing that by himself. 
Tom said he'd be retiring next October. 
I didn't know that Tom played the trumpet. 
Do you think it'll rain this weekend? 
I know Tom probably didn't do what he was supposed to do. 
I don't remember asking you to do that. 
There is no way I'm going to let you do that. 
Tom told everyone that he was lonely. 
I wonder whether Tom is still busy. 
What is the name of our CEO? 
I know you're worried about Tom. 
I thought I did pretty well. 
Tom admitted he was troubled. 
Nobody could hear what Tom was saying. 
Tom said he'd visit Mary in Australia next summer. 
They're welfare queens. 
Not everyone is ready. 
There is going to be a storm. 
Tom must've been skeptical. 
Where's the meeting going to be held? 
I think Tom is incorrect. 
Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that. 
I thought it would be easy to do that. 
Tom says he hopes Mary knows she has to do that. 
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday. 
That isn't a game for kids. 
I hope you'll wait for us. 
Tom said that he hoped that Mary would be here today. 
Tom said Mary is worried. 
Tom and Mary said they enjoy teaching French. 
Tom said that he was really glad Mary did that. 
I wonder whether Tom found anything. 
I'm from South America. 
I would've done that a different way. 
I don't think Tom knows if Mary will come or not. 
I doubt that Tom would've had the courage to do that. 
Tom doesn't want to go to his company's Christmas do this year. 
You are nothing but a student. 
Tom said he'd never allow Mary to do that. 
Why do you think Tom likes baseball so much? 
I will telephone you later on. 
Many people believe that's not going to happen. 
Tom knows he's not supposed to eat peanuts. 
Tom told me he was going to try it again. 
I wish you'd told me earlier. 
Tom said he has confidence in Mary. 
Tom thought he might not need to do that anymore. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary would be gone by the time we get there. 
I don't think Tom would allow Mary to do that on her own. 
Don't study. 
I thought you were still in Australia. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was miserable. 
I'm not sure that both Tom and Mary want to go there. 
I don't think it'll take very long to do that for you. 
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary. 
I know you want to help. 
Tom and I both stood up at the same time. 
They said that they didn't need to hurry. 
I know you've got more important things to think about. 
I am not deaf. 
I have not read all the books. 
Tom never should've been laid off. 
Did you know that Tom isn't planning to attend today's meeting? 
I wonder if Tom has ever asked Mary why she got fired. 
Tom said Mary will unlikely have to do that. 
This is the kind of music I like to listen to. 
She crocheted herself a jumper. 
I know that Tom used to be good at doing that. 
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary that she didn't need do that. 
I knew that Tom was afraid that the police might arrest him. 
I suspect Tom didn't visit Australia. 
I thought it'd take months. 
They thought that they could do that for me. 
It's been ages since we last met. 
I realize that Tom could be finished doing that by 2:30. 
I didn't have enough money to buy Tom a present. 
Tom must have seen something. 
I thought that you said we weren't going to be here. 
They say that they're not afraid to do that. 
Mary became pregnant at the age of 14. 
I think Tom needs to go. 
I have a lot of work to do. 
I don't think I'm drunk enough for this. 
They told me that they love me. 
Tom said Mary was going to do that for John. 
I know that Tom is finished doing that. 
They say that they need to do that.

You really could've gotten hurt. 
You should've come to the party.

It's a bargain. 
I should've been able to do that for you. 
I know that I shouldn't have asked Tom to do that, but I did. 
I wonder whether Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that. 
I will check up on Tom. 
I hope that you're good. 
You don't think Tom suspects anything, do you? 
They told me that they'd help. 
He is hard to please. 
Tom and Mary said that they were embarrassed. 
I didn't know that Tom should do that himself. 
Tom said that he suspected that Mary would do that. 
Tom is going to be very suspicious if you do that.

It's not urgent.

I'm dying of laughter. 
Tom assumed everybody in the room knew that Mary couldn't understand French.

This is not a mistake. 
I don't think anybody really expected you to be here.

I am very grateful to you for your advice.

Is there any chance you'll come back to Australia again this year? 
They know that they cheated. 
Tom said that he's been very happy here. 
Tom said Mary was going to do that herself. 
Tom said I should speak French. 
The sample is not pure enough. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be terrified. 
I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you yesterday. 
Tom said he'd never seen anything like that before. 
I don't think Tom would be doing that if he didn't have to. 
Tom knew that I was outside. 
They were very annoyed. 
Do you really think Tom is exhausted? 
He's never hunted. 
Tom said that he thought that it would be better if Mary didn't do that. 
I also don't think Tom will do that. 
I don't think that's such a big problem. 
This is not my problem. 
I suspect Tom and Mary need to do that right away. 
I'm really sorry I told you that. 
Tom is a very good speaker of French. 
I thought you were rude. 
Tom wasn't born blind. 
Tom and Mary said they like this time of year. 
Tom told me he hoped Mary wouldn't be hesitant to do that. 
I don't think that we should stay at the same hotel that we stayed at last time. 
I don't think Tom is conscious. 
No one would help us do that. 
I am about to leave here. 
Tom and Mary said they knew that how to win. 
Tom said that he didn't have an email address. 
Tom thought it would be a good idea to see a doctor. 
They said that they were really curious. 
What is your favorite animal? 
I thought you said you didn't like to do that.

I don't think you're trying very hard to find Tom. 
I handed the letter to Tom. 
I know you're upset. We all are. 
Tom and Mary say they're feeling kind of tired. 
We know you lied about Tom. 
The word's origin is unknown. 
You will pay for that. 
I know I should've helped Tom, but I didn't have the time. 
It seems like Tom and Mary like doing that together. 
I'm not certain I need to do that. 
I always thought Tom and Mary were married to each other. 
I wasn't aware that Tom wouldn't be there. 
Tom may be absent. 
What's the world's highest mountain? 
I know that Tom didn't know that we wouldn't be able to do that. 
Her bicycle is blue. 
I'm afraid that'll happen. 
I thought that you said you saw Tom doing that. 
I know Tom doesn't know that I know how to do that. 
I know Tom won't like the stew that Mary made. 
I should've told Tom that I didn't know any French. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that I should do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was sympathetic. 
I would've shut my phone off. 
Tom realized that doing that wasn't going to be easy. 
I really should've left earlier. 
I don't think Tom knows what's really going on. 
Tom's a real expert. 
Maybe you could learn a thing or two from Tom. 
I don't think Tom and Mary have ever gone swimming together. 
Tom's unharmed.

I don't think it'll get better. 
Tom thinks Mary is awake. 
I didn't know that Tom didn't do that by himself. 
I didn't think we should leave so early. 
Tom and Mary said they don't like doing that. 
Tom realized Mary had to do that. 
You're not having much luck, are you? 
Tom told me he'd sort it out. 
I should've called for help. 
Tom said no one else tried doing that. 
He's been made redundant. 
Tom told Mary he was glad that she'd come to Australia. 
Tom told me he wasn't afraid. 
Tom said he knew that Mary should do that. 
Tom said he's never done that. 
You're stronger than me. 
The colors are vivid. 
You and I both know that Tom needs to do that. 
I'm afraid I have other plans. 
I tried to persuade Tom to come to Australia with us, but he said he had other things he had to do. 
Tom may be crying right now.

This is the first time I've fried an egg.

Tom will probably not go.

It's not going to ever happen anymore. 
If only my thoughts were to come out of my mouth like a receipt being printed. 
I think Tom probably loves Mary.

I knew that Tom wasn't a lieutenant. 
I'd have helped you. 
Tom thinks Mary won't be in Australia much longer. 
I don't think Tom really overdosed. 
Didn't you know I don't have to do that? 
Tom realized that it was going to be difficult to do that. 
This time, it will be different. 
Where there's a will, there's a way. 
You are not supposed to smoke here. 
Tom said he thought he'd be able to help us. 
I didn't think anyone could do this. 
We have matured. 
Tom weighs a lot more than Mary does. 
Is there any possibility Tom will do that? 
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be embarrassed by that. 
I thought Tom would be in his office. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was happy here. 
Tom lets Mary do anything she wants to do. 
You think Tom could've done that on his own, don't you? 
I wonder whether I really have to do that again. 
Tom told me Mary was sick. 
Tom said I was very helpful. 
I promise that I'll protect you. 
If I had known about it, I would have told you. 
They say that they would've paid more. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to learn French. 
Tom says he thinks it's not possible to do that. 
I don't think the weather will clear up. 
Asked if he was happy, Tom said he was. 
I thought you said you couldn't draw. 
I wonder whether I really need that. 
How do we know that isn't true? 
Do you like to travel? 
There was no way that I could've done that without your help. 
I'm assuming it was just a coincidence. 
It was clear that Tom wouldn't need to do that. 
Tom said he plans to do that on Monday. 
I know that Tom is a special kid. 
I would've stayed in Boston longer if I could've.

I think Tom has been barking up the wrong tree. 
Tom said he didn't need anything. 
It was hard for Tom to admit that he needed help. 
Did you know that Tom and Mary were planning to do that? 
We weren't aware we were being recorded. 
Good morning, everybody. 
You people are totally insane. 
Tom speaks Bengali. 
I suspect Tom didn't enjoy doing that. 
Drunkards and children don't lie. 
Tom seems to know nothing about that. 
I don't think Tom realizes just how much Mary loved him.

Tom said he isn't going to be here tomorrow. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be cooperative.

I know how hard it must've been for you to tell Tom about what happened. 
I promised Tom that I wouldn't cry. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be bored if we did that. 
I doubt that Tom would ever do that kind of thing. 
Do you have any idea where Tom might be now? 
That's not what Tom is going to talk about. 
Tom was just pretending that he was tired. 
I don't think that I need to tell you what to do. 
As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 
I didn't know that Tom knew who did that for you. 
I didn't know we were supposed to do that today. 
That is not acceptable. 
Tom said no one had asked him to do that.

I am out of time. 
You are wearing your shirt inside out. 
It ain't over till it's over. 
I think Tom doesn't want to do that right now. 
Do you think Tom would've done that if we'd asked him to?

Did Tom know Mary could do that? 
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't planning to go to Boston with you. 
I am fine, and you?

I don't think Tom really has time to help. 
Tom said he didn't know why Mary didn't want to do that. 
You are free to use this car.

You must do that by the end of the week. 
I know that Tom would tell you how to do that if you asked him.

He's studying.

Is there any chance that you'll be coming to Boston this year? 
Tom and Mary told me they had to walk home. 
I hope you know that the last thing that I want to do is go there without your permission. 
Don't make promises that you cannot keep.

Does Tom think he'll stay in Australia long? 
I assume you haven't heard from Tom. 
Tom says there weren't any teachers there. 
I thought Tom might not be permitted to do that by himself. 
I know that Tom wasn't ready to do that. 
I think Tom has the hots for you. 
I wonder whether Tom really could help us. 
I am unintelligent, but at least I am intelligent enough to know it. 
Tom said Mary should have stayed in Boston longer. 
I wish you would've stayed home. 
Tom said he'd definitely win.

I think Tom is adaptable. 
Tom said that he didn't think he'd be able to do that without any help. 
I wonder if Tom can swim as well as Mary. 
I know that Tom doesn't need to do that anymore. 
I know that Tom knows he shouldn't do that here. 
Tom and Mary told me that they got here early today. 
I don't want to work. 
I thought Tom and Mary were planning to stay for a month. 
Tom said that he wished Mary and I'd behave ourselves. 
They said that they did that three times. 
Tom said Mary didn't look like a teacher. 
I know that Tom knows Mary shouldn't do that. 
I know that Tom is a smart guy. 
Tom and Mary think that I don't know what they did. 
Almost no one knows that we're brothers. 
They said that they felt uneasy. 
I don't think anybody really thought that Tom was busy. 
Tom thought Mary was going to let him go home early. 
I heard that both Tom and Mary have been fired. 
The show is on Monday. 
Tom said he could've done that alone. 
I would never do such a thing. 
I think we should leave now. 
Tom said he liked Mary. 
Tom said that he thought I might win. 
Tom said that he thought that I ought to do that. 
The family loves to watch murder mysteries together. 
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had done that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was taking piano lessons. 
Tom still plans to go. 
Tom thought Mary might be allowed to do that. 
I don't think that it's worth the price they're asking. 
Tom said he's not sleepy yet. 
Tom said that he thought that he'd be able to do that for me. 
I thought Tom wasn't afraid of anyone. 
What denominations would you like? 
I wonder whether Tom wants to buy a car. 
Tom said that he thought you'd win. 
I figured I might be able to help. 
I already knew Tom couldn't do that. 
Tom says he'll do that when he's in Australia. 
Tom says Mary is willing to do that for us. 
Someone else must've seen what happened, too. 
Tom believed that was going to happen. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was mistaken. 
I'm afraid Tom may have lost his way. 
Did you know Tom was going to do that? 
I wonder whether we'll ever find out what happened. 
I was just about to call you, but you beat me to it. 
Tom wouldn't allow Mary to help him. 
I was kind of surprised when Tom said that he wouldn't do that that. 
I think Tom and Mary are Canadians. 
I couldn't sleep because of the heat. 
Are you sure this is going to work? 
Germans have no sense of humour? I don't find that funny! 
Tom and Mary said they'd probably do that. 
You should put parentheses around this phrase. 
Tom said Mary is probably still awake. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might need to do that this evening. 
Things don't always happen the way we expect. 
Tom and Mary told me they forgot something. 
They said that that was their favorite store. 
Tom said that he knew he might need to do that on October 20th. 
Do you think that you can sing for us? 
I don't think it's weird at all. 
It was clear that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that. 
I think they'll have a chance. 
Tom is planning to leave at 2:30. 
This is an historical moment. 
Everyone here except you has done that. 
I want you to know I appreciate your help. 
I know that Tom isn't able to play the bassoon very well. 
You're a bit younger than Tom, aren't you? 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't left the windows open. 
Tom would probably have done something about that if he could've. 
I'm right. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't angry. 
Tom said he likes pizza the way Mary makes it. 
I'm pretty certain I can do that. 
A ball hit her on the right leg. 
I thought Tom said something else. 
It's not something I want to discuss. 
I think Tom is ready. 
The game was put off until next week. 
You are dead. 
So does this restaurant have pilaf? 
Tom and Mary are planning on going tomorrow, aren't they? 
Don't go near that. 
Tom told me he wasn't planning on doing that. 
I think Tom is discontented. 
I should've said no. 
You know that we don't have much time right now. 
I don't think that Tom likes anyone. 
The U.S. dominated the world after World War Two. 
Tom and Mary don't know where John is planning to go. 
The temperature in Boston is expected to drop to -8°F. 
Could you take me home, please? 
Tom told me he thought he might win. 
I believe that I've seen the document that you're talking about. 
I know that Tom might get in trouble if he does that. 
Go to bed! 
Tom called Mary and told her that he needed to stay in Boston for three more days. 
Tom said he couldn't remember where he'd put his keys. 
I don't think it's as important as Tom thinks it is. 
I think Tom wants something to write on. 
I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom isn't someone you can easily replace. 
I will try not to disturb you while you are studying. 
Tom would've done that if he'd known he was supposed to. 
I wonder what could've made Tom change his mind. 
I know that Tom didn't know who did that for him. 
Tom and Mary said that they weren't able to do that. 
I hope that Tom gets the help he needs. 
We must've taken the wrong road. 
Tom didn't want any of his friends to know that he was a drug dealer. 
I knew that Tom was going to want to do that. 
I have been struck by lightning twice. 
I think you could've done this by yourself. 
Tom said he didn't want to study French. 
I swear that I didn't know that Tom would do that. 
I wonder whether Tom really wanted to go to Boston with us. 
I think I'll go to Australia next year. 
I thought you knew Tom couldn't speak French. 
I'm slightly hungry. 
I thought that you said Tom did that. 
I don't think that anybody knows yet. 
They put their hats on and left. 
Who would be stupid enough to do that? 
Tom didn't tell Mary he was unhappy. 
You knew Tom told everyone he was going to do that, didn't you? 
Tom realized that I didn't need to do that. 
What's one thing that you really like to do? 
Didn't you know there was a good chance that this would happen? 
Tom said doing that may cause problems. 
They said that they need to get more sleep. 
The accident threw traffic into great confusion. 
Tom said he cried every day. 
Tom thinks he can save the world. 
I know that Tom knows he shouldn't be doing that here. 
Tom was a little overweight when he was a kid. 
Tom thought Mary lived in Australia. 
I don't think Tom will be doing that by himself. 
Tom said he didn't know Mary wasn't able to speak French very well. 
Tom didn't like the song that Mary sang. 
Tom thinks that if he had tried a little harder, he could have won the race. 
They said that they weren't sad. 
Tom thinks I need to eat more vegetables. 
Tom thinks you can do it. 
He lives an ascetic lifestyle. 
Tom said he thought that he wouldn't enjoy going to Australia with me. 
Tom is wrong. 
Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that by herself. 
Tom told me he first met Mary in Boston when he was a teenager. 
I don't think it'll be possible to do that without some help. 
I know that Tom would like to know if you aren't planning to do that. 
I doubt Tom will stick around. 
They say that they're too old to start over. 
The store is closed Mondays. 
I know that Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle. 
I do not want to make a mistake. 
Tom and Mary said they heard the gunshots. 
Let's make believe that we're cowboys. 
I don't think I want to go there anymore. 
Tom said that he hopes that you won't eat the last piece of cake. 
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to do that. 
I should've paid in advance. 
We are going to go to the airport. 
I doubted that Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that. 
It isn't Tom's idea, it's mine. 
I didn't think anybody else had noticed. 
That cat is so cute! 
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that. 
I know that Tom is a mechanic. 
A jack of all trades is a master of none. 
I wonder if Tom is satisfied. 
I know that you still want to be with me. 
Tom told me that he was unemployed. 
I didn't know that you could understand French. 
I doubt you will be happy with my report. 
I should've known that Tom would do that. 
Tom told me he used to live in Australia. 
I'm glad that you succeeded. 
It'll take not less than one hour to go there. 
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam. 
You may use my desk if you want. 
I think Tom would agree with me. 
Don't stay too long! 
I know Tom is popular. 
It makes sense. 
Tom said that he really did do that without anybody's help. 
I wonder whether Tom is prepared to do that. 
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today. 
I know that Tom used to be a speech coach. 
He cannot swim a mile. 
Tom said he probably isn't going to do that. 
Tom said Mary was upset. 
I don't think that Tom is a good lawyer. 
Tom is going to have to figure it out. 
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that? 
They said that they hope it'll happen soon. 
Tom said he's not being used. 
I thought I had nothing to lose. 
By daybreak the storm was over. 
No one I know really wants to do that. 
I think that Tom is expecting someone to make dinner for him. 
They said that they don't want to do that. 
The price of gasoline is so high that we cannot buy a big car. 
Why didn't you tell me that you knew how to do that already? 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be discreet. 
"Thanks." "What for?" "For everything." 
You are a teacher. 
Many men, many minds. 
Anything is possible. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were displeased. 
Tom and Mary say they need to do that. 
Let's hope that never happens again. 
I don't think that actually happened. 
Tom said Mary has been arrested before. 
Tom said Mary isn't ready. 
I don't think Tom knows everybody's name. 
Tom had trouble admitting he was wrong. 
I thought you might want to play a game of chess. 
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed. 
I know that it's highly unlikely anybody knows me. 
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it. 
Are you going to be OK? 
They told me that they were famished. 
I thought something was seriously wrong with Tom. 
Tom said that he's not sleepy yet. 
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary was going to do that. 
I know that Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore. 
I had no idea Tom could do that. 
It looks like Tom is waiting for someone. 
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston. 
You broke the computer. Nice going, genius. 
I am afraid that you will get lost. 
They say that they like studying French. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is. 
I knew that Tom was ready to do that. 
I suspect Tom will probably do that. 
Tom said he was going to stay up all night long. 
I didn't know that Tom was a veteran. 
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy. 
My daughter frequently experienced asthma attacks as a child. 
I knew that Tom didn't know that you were the one who had done that. 
We've already met everybody. 
Tom said there were still a lot things left to do. 
You don't have a chance. 
If Tom had had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary. 
Tom told everyone that he was glad that that was going to happen. 
You are always doubting my word. 
I didn't know that I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do. 
There's a good chance that we'll win. 
Tom says he knows Mary can win. 
I know that Tom isn't a baseball fan. 
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that. 
I think Tom shouldn't agree to do that. 
I don't think Tom has sold anything all day. 
I think that I am too old for her. 
I don't think I should've left early. 
I didn't say I was going to Australia. 
Tom should've stayed in Boston a few more days. 
I should've told Tom sooner. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that. 
Tom'll remember. 
It's not something I think I can do. 
Tom told me where he was planning to stay. 
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia. 
I know Tom was impolite. 
Do you have a pencil I can borrow? 
Tom also wanted to do that. 
I could've done that for you. 
I think Tom is home. 
It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women. 
Tom should do everything they tell him. 
Everyone but Tom knew that he didn't have to go to Australia. 
What's the most beautiful place in the world? 
The storm caused much damage to the crop. 
I don't think that everybody has given up. 
Let's get our photograph taken. 
I knew it wouldn't be easy. 
Suddenly all the lights went out. 
Tom and Mary said they'll probably win. 
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that. 
Tom and Mary thought that they'd find other jobs. 
Tom said I shouldn't leave early. 
I know I should stay and help. 
Don't look at me. 
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning on doing that tomorrow. 
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus. 
I'm not sure I want to be doing this. 
I know that Tom does that well. 
Tom said nothing had changed. 
That isn't one of my priorities. 
It's not something that I can decide quickly. 
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night. 
I know that Tom knows that I needed to do that. 
Stay out of this. 
I know that Tom is afraid that he'll get fired. 
If I were you I would call the doctor. 
I was not feeling very hungry. 
I've done everything you've asked me to do. 
Do you have a tie I could borrow? 
I didn't think we'd find anybody who can could that for us. 
Tom isn't an angel. 
I think Tom is mad. 
That sounds awesome. 
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give something to her. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would wait. 
Tom said that he didn't think that the smell bothered Mary. 
Tom said he's willing to do that for us. 
Can you believe Tom is still only thirteen? 
Tom sent Mary his picture. 
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today. 
They say that they've never eaten Thai food. 
I think that Tom and Mary have both never been to Boston. 
They are playing chess. 
I thought I heard someone singing. 
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia. 
It's not as hot here as I expected. 
They don't think that they'll do that. 
I don't think I belong here. 
No one saw Tom leave. 
I knew Tom used to live in Boston. 
Tom ran back home to get something that he forgot. 
Tom told me he might win. 
Tom had no problems with Mary. 
I thought Tom refused to do that. 
How do you know that you're not mistaking me for somebody else? 
You should've refused to stay in Boston. 
No one can save you. 
I'm glad I didn't do that. 
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong. 
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore. 
Tom should never have been let out prison. 
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m. 
They said that they couldn't wait. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself. 
I know what I would do. 
He needn't have brought the umbrella. 
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them. 
Tom thinks I need to do that today. 
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do. 
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity. 
Tom told me that you were with him yesterday afternoon. 
Tom and I didn't know that we were the ones who were supposed to do that. 
I am so tired that I can hardly walk. 
They felt that they needed to do something. 
I read many foreign languages, but speak none. 
You set up a trap. 
I should've added more salt. 
I know that that isn't what you want. 
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married. 
I think Tom is smashed. 
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that. 
I think Tom is sorry. 
You were skinny the first time I met you. 
I think Tom could've gotten home by himself. 
Both Tom and Mary know who you are. 
Mary said she doesn't plan on doing that by herself. 
It's not supposed to be fun. 
They said they were unimpressed. 
Tom hasn't yet told us what he needs to do. 
I know you probably didn't need to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom still remembers where we first met. 
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided. 
Tom said that he'd expected Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th. 
Tom said that he thought he might be required to do that again. 
Tom thinks that you want me to pay the bill. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim. 
I knew that Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that. 
Tom said he had to leave early. 
They realize that they're being ignored. 
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would've gotten here by now. 
Tom and Mary said they would do it. 
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia. 
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days. 
Tom said that he thought that I seemed unconcerned. 
I should've stayed and helped Tom. 
Tom said that he thought I'd be able to do that. 
I figured Tom would panic. 
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here. 
I wonder whether it'll snow tomorrow. 
I wonder whether Tom is pleased. 
I am frying fish. 
The wind calmed down in the evening. 
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that. 
Slow down. 
Tom would've done that by now if he was really planning to do it. 
I know that Tom could do that if he really needed to. 
We'll never know. 
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary. 
Didn't you know that your taillights weren't working? 
They think that they're in love. 
Tom and Mary think they can do that. 
Tom is never going to hurt anyone again. 
I am learning Esperanto very quickly. 
You aren't going to get in trouble for helping me, are you? 
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men. 
I think Tom will be excited. 
We'll be landing in 15 minutes. 
Tom said he would take care of Mary. 
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do. 
I thought you were going to fix that. 
I hope I never have to do that. 
Tom has already been told he's not going to be allowed to do that. 
They say that they're unsure. 
I know that Tom didn't know that he wouldn't be able to do that. 
Tom should have told me earlier. 
I have to go to the toilet. 
Both men apologised to each other. 
You aren't doing anything wrong, are you? 
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that. 
They say that they also need to do that. 
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that. 
They told me that they'd help me. 
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house. 
Don't you think we have a chance to win? 
They said that they wouldn't speak French. 
Tom thought that Mary didn't like computer games. 
Tom and Mary say that they don't think that they snore. 
I knew Tom was active in his church. 
Everybody knew Tom could speak French well. 
Tom said he'd found something. 
A business is not a charity. 
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia. 
I don't think that Tom is as good-looking as John is. 
Tom said that he thought that prices at that store were too high. 
I don't think anyone disputes that. 
Tom and Mary said they couldn't recall. 
Tom said that he hoped he'd be able to do that today. 
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you? 
Tom said Mary was unafraid. 
I'm sorry it happened like this. 
I know that Tom isn't afraid to walk through the woods alone. 
Both Tom and I are angry. 
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help. 
It's hot. 
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston. 
No one asked me whether I liked it or not. 
Many old people these days can't keep up with the times. 
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem. 
I know that Tom appreciated that. 
Tom told me he'd decided to do that. 
It is a kind of cat. 
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that. 
I'm sure you will succeed. 
Tom denied that he had accepted the bribe. 
Tom said that he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea. 
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was broke. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable. 
Can't this wait till morning? 
We will be landing in 15 minutes. 
We know that won't happen anymore. 
They said that they were really sorry. 
Tom cleared his throat loudly. 
I think Tom is unprejudiced. 
I'm afraid I've lost it. 
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy. 
We're both adults. 
They're not as weak as they used to be. 
I know that Tom was supposed to do that. 
Tom said that he thought I should do that today. 
Don't talk about business while we are eating. 
I don't think I need to help Tom do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was tough. 
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family. 
Tom said that he thought that you knew Mary. 
She's got to be taken to hospital. 
I would've helped you if you had asked. 
Okay. 
Tom said that he thought I was wearing a wig. 
This is not a drill. 
Tom should've done that a long time ago. 
I think Tom slept all afternoon. 
I wonder whether Tom is upset. 
Tom said that he knew that they might not let him do that at school. 
Tom said that he hopes Mary likes doing that. 
Tom would've done that for Mary if he'd had more time. 
I don't think you really need to do that. 
Something is still not right. 
Are you crazy? 
I thought Tom liked riddles. 
I know Tom isn't planning on going to Boston with you. 
Tom said that he isn't sure Mary has to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that. 
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October? 
I didn't know that you didn't want to do that by yourselves. 
Tom said that he thought doing that would be fun. 
I think that you'll discover that it was Tom's fault. 
I thought it was rather ingenious. 
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that? 
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that? 
Do you still plan on doing that with Tom? 
Tom said he didn't feel safe. 
His younger sister is a famous TV star. 
I know what time you said you would be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time. 
I don't think they're complaining. 
You and I both know that that's not true. 
Let's assume that'll happen. 
Tom told everyone that he didn't know what to do. 
Tom needed someone he could trust. 
I want to hear a story. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was being truthful. 
It's quite likely that Tom will come. 
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year. 
I didn't think that anybody had tried that before. 
You should've made better use of your time. 
They say that they're not planning on going. 
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that. 
I'm learning Old English. 
I want the rest of the money you owe me. 
Tom said Mary could've done that alone. 
I hope more people will be here. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was difficult to get along with. 
They said they were very drunk. 
You could've told me earlier. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conceited. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical. 
I know that Tom never does that anymore. 
Tom says that he only swears when it is absolutely necessary. 
I don't think Tom is high. 
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was interested in basketball. 
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting. 
Tom assumed everyone knew that he couldn't do that. 
Tom said that he planned on going on October 20th. 
They said that they're doing just fine. 
Hostilities resumed between the two powers. 
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everybody else in his family did. 
I'd have done that if I could've. 
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that. 
Tom assumed that everybody at school knew that he'd been arrested. 
Tom wished that he knew how to make Mary happy. 
Tom said he's seen Mary do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they needed the money. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was going to be able to do that. 
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that. 
Everybody knows Tom can't speak French very well. 
My findings suggest that is not the case. 
Tom found the watch he had lost. 
I don't know anything about Boston. 
Tom said that he thought it might be dangerous to do that. 
Someone must've left the window open. 
I know that Tom is a messy person. 
I'm sorry, sir. There must have been some mistake. 
I know that Tom knew Mary was planning to do that. 
Tom was just stating the obvious. 
Tom said he wasn't offered a job. 
Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't happy. 
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours. 
No one doubts that you'll be able to pass the examination. 
Where's everyone? 
How have you been feeling? 
Fortune favors the brave. 
They're not sure that they can do that again. 
I thought Tom was doing that. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me. 
I thought Tom had heard us. 
It's not compulsory. 
I hope no one comes. 
What color was Tom wearing? 
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them. 
Tom said he'd walk Mary home. 
It'll be hard for Tom to win. 
We should've hired someone more qualified. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed. 
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight. 
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia. 
Tom told me that he was too tired to study. 
Where's your luggage? 
Both my parents are musicians. 
I live in Groningen. 
How do we know that that's not true? 
Tom said that he didn't want to die. 
That's the car I want to buy. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow. 
I know Tom is chubby. 
Will it be a dry day tomorrow? 
I'm not sure Tom is going to be willing to talk to me. 
Tom said he's glad Mary was able to win. 
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that. 
It is not raining. 
I can't speak English, much less German. 
Tom thought something bad would happen. 
I thought that's what you would've wanted. 
I know that it's highly unlikely anyone knows me. 
Where's Tom now? 
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer. 
They said that they knew they could win. 
I doubt Tom will be reasonable. 
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball. 
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong. 
Tom said he was unable to win. 
Tom said that he thought he might not have to do that. 
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon. 
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us. 
It's not enough to know only one language. 
She is a blonde girl. 
Tom thinks that we can't do that. 
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am. 
Tom said he isn't mad. 
Tom may have done the same thing that Mary did. 
I know that Tom is a sophomore. 
Tom definitely knew that he shouldn't have eaten that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested. 
I thought you were planning to be here early. 
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday. 
Tom shouldn't have ever tried doing that by himself. 
How's your father? 
My son is not a snob. 
I would've let Tom do it. 
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected. 
I don't think they're bad people. 
They said that they didn't want me to wait. 
No one suspected it. 
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone. 
I wonder whether it'll really be hot tomorrow. 
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain? 
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do that again. 
They swore that they wouldn't do that again. 
I don't really plan to do that. 
I know that Tom will allow you to do that. 
Tom said that Mary would do that. 
They've said that they won't do that. 
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John. 
Tom said that he thought that there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would like it. 
You're not the only one Tom asked. 
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet. 
They put their notebooks away. 
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable. 
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that. 
I didn't say I used to live in Australia. 
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom said that he wanted to buy something for Mary. 
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would. 
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty. 
We went up by two floors to reach the apparel stalls. 
I don't think Tom is funny. 
Tom thinks he's going to die soon. 
I thought Tom was sick. 
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that. 
They said that they'd be happy to help. 
Tom and I both want to go. 
I didn't know you'd tell me. 
Tom and Mary said that they were jealous. 
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom. 
Tom promised that he'd never again make such a mistake. 
Don't you think we should've talked to Tom about this? 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was fat. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia. 
Don't sweat the small stuff. 
I don't think that anybody can help me now. 
Tom said it's a very common problem. 
Are you sure this'll work? 
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon. 
I know that you can hear me. 
You seemed to be unwilling to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he thought that she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought. 
The doctor is not available now. 
Football players make a lot of money. 
Tom's a first-time offender. 
I promise you that won't happen. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might need to do that. 
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again. 
I don't think it ever worked. 
Don't forget to take your medicine. 
You don't know how hard it was for Tom. 
Tom has given a lot of things to me. 
I know that Tom is a few years older than Mary. 
I wonder if Tom likes to do that. 
I know that Tom can't do that without some help. 
Tom admitted that he lied to me. 
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan on staying at home all day. 
Tom doesn't know I still have this. 
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing. 
We both love Tom. 
Tom said that he hopes you try your best to do that. 
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do. 
Tom said Mary knew she might be permitted to do that this evening. 
I don't think that I know the man who's playing the drums. 
This old man has liver spots on his skin. 
Tom and Mary vowed they'd never do that. 
Give me that candle. 
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do. 
There's no time to explain. 
Tom didn't realize he had to leave. 
They said they were afraid. 
Tom and Mary say that they can't find their hats. 
I graduated from Kyoto University. 
You're comparing apples and oranges! 
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed. 
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested. 
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out. 
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia. 
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore. 
They're living in a fantasy world. 
They said that they thought I'm charming. 
I didn't know that Tom was in the hospital. 
I don't think you'll have much fun doing that. 
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to. 
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that. 
I plan to skip lunch. 
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was afraid. 
Tom has already told me that he's decided to go Boston next summer. 
That doesn't make sense. 
They say that they're dying. 
Tom offered to lend me some money. 
Do you think Tom would let me do that? 
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing. 
Tom told everyone that he needed to do that. 
I don't think that Tom is a native French speaker. 
They said that they weren't planning to go. 
They say that they've taught French. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious. 
I know that Tom knows that I don't need to do that. 
You have to help Tom. 
Tom told us that he had a headache. 
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded. 
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't. 
I'm glad to hear it! 
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French. 
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that. 
You should've refused to go to Boston. 
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary. 
Tom said that isn't the main reason why Mary should do that. 
Tom doesn't have a car and neither does Mary. 
I'm a cat. 
I know you don't do that anymore. 
Tom said he was no different. 
Tom admitted what he said was wrong. 
Tom could've been afraid. 
Who do you think asked me to give this to you? 
I've just been sick. 
I hope I get a raise. 
Tom said that he didn't think we should even consider doing that. 
Tom said that he would've come if we'd invited him. 
I don't think I'll likely do that. 
Tom said he might cry. 
It is Sunday. 
Tom told me he wasn't tired. 
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy. 
I think you know we have to do that today. 
I didn't think Tom would actually do that. 
I knew Tom would leave early. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary understood French. 
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him. 
I don't think that anybody's lived in this house in a long time. 
Tom denied he stole the money. 
Tom said he hasn't yet decided what he'll do. 
Everyone knew that Tom didn't like going to Boston. 
Tom said he thought that tomorrow would be a sunny day. 
Tom is obviously drunk. 
I'm absolutely certain that that's not going to happen. 
Everyone was there except Tom. 
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom. 
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning. 
I think Tom was supposed to be here. 
Tom and Mary said they had fully recovered. 
I didn't know that you weren't planning on doing that by yourself. 
I don't think there's any way out of here. 
There is no rose without a thorn. 
Tom thought that Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French. 
You know I wouldn't do that. 
I think we all know that that's a bad idea. 
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do. 
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time. 
Tom and Mary said that they were ticklish. 
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today. 
I wonder how Tom knew that I would be here. 
Tom said that he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that. 
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was mean. 
So, where's the problem? 
Tom didn't think that Mary was beautiful. 
He will have to do that task again. 
I know Tom didn't know anybody who was able to do that. 
Only fresh veg is sold here. 
I believe that this isn't a good idea. 
Tom has already been asked not to do that. 
Here is your change. 
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago. 
When was the last time you asked somebody for help? 
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny. 
I know that Tom is irritated. 
I didn't meet anyone new today. 
This lake is the deepest in Japan. 
I knew Tom was planning to do that. 
Tom and I both don't speak French. 
I thought you'd be ready. 
I know that Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom was glad that that had happened. 
They said they were very tired. 
You aren't old enough to get a driver's license, are you? 
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. 
I thought that you said that you did that on Monday. 
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston. 
Tom denied he met Mary last week. 
That's not why I'm here. 
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländer. 
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall. 
They said that they isn't thirty yet. 
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday. 
I thought Tom was already back. 
Tom said Mary knew she might not be permitted to do that unless John does it with her. 
Tom and Mary told everybody they were pleased. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
I thought Mary was cute. 
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself. 
Tom said he thought Mary was happy. 
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia? 
Tom said he'd pay for everything. 
They told me that they weren't alone. 
I don't think that I can finish the job alone. 
Tom said Mary isn't safe. 
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me. 
They said that they'd see me tomorrow. 
Tom said Mary was concerned. 
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is going to do this afternoon. 
Tom paid someone to do that. 
I thought Tom would be cooperative. 
Tom told me that he was safe. 
Tom said I should go to Boston with you. 
They think that they know what to do. 
Tom thinks Mary will be scared. 
Tom and I are both very proud of you. 
I knew that Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to. 
We can't pretend Tom is normal. 
Tom's amused. 
Tom should never have tried doing that alone. 
Tom and Mary said they'd never ever do that. 
I'm taller than him. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conservative. 
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today. 
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation. 
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that? 
Tom set down his glass. 
You'd think that would have impressed Tom. 
This is the first time I've bought a newspaper in this city. 
That's a good question. 
Without water, we cannot exist. 
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting. 
Tom and Mary say they didn't agree to do that. 
I know that Tom will be able to help us do that. 
I had lunch three hours ago. 
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help. 
I knew Tom would forgive me. 
You are the only one who can protect them. 
Can someone explain this to me? 
Did you know that Tom was going to be in Boston all week? 
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog. 
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other. 
I know that Tom didn't know that I wasn't going to do that. 
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself. 
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do. 
Tom and Mary say that they aren't sure that they're ready. 
There is no logical reason for this. 
I suspected Tom was intoxicated. 
I hope that I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary enjoyed doing that. 
They said they were feeling fine. 
I wish that you hadn't seen me doing that. 
Tom and Mary said they had no money. 
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that. 
Tom should've never gotten that job. 
Tom told Mary that she was his one and only. 
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled. 
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that. 
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do. 
I think you're terrific. 
I wonder whether Tom is going to Boston next week. 
Tom says he didn't know that Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her. 
I know that Tom doesn't want to do that. 
You're not an idiot. 
I think Tom doesn't win very often when he plays chess. 
Tom said he didn't know Mary wasn't able to speak French very well. 
Tom said that he knew Mary would win the race. 
I know Tom came to Australia last week. 
Tom said Mary wasn't mad. 
I think we have bought everything we need. 
Tom said that he thought he might not need to do that by himself. 
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it. 
I think Tom is average. 
You're not just working for Tom. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself. 
I don't think Tom knows how it happened. 
It is not a watch. 
Tom and Mary said they're unafraid. 
I'm from the United States. 
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time. 
I know you don't want to hurt me. 
Tom seems to be unwilling to correct his mistakes. 
I loved that book! 
Tom said Mary wouldn't like doing that. 
Tom said he felt safe. 
Tom is homesick. 
Did you know that would happen? 
I think Tom believed me. 
I don't think we can do that by 2:30. 
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that. 
I thought that you said we weren't going to do that anymore. 
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who's able to do that. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom has a girlfriend. 
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me. 
I know that Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be nervous doing that. 
That's the guitar I want to buy. 
I think Tom did it. 
See you tomorrow morning! 
They told me that they were ambidextrous. 
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that. 
I really thought Tom would change his mind. 
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped to buy a chocolate bar. 
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that. 
I didn't know that I was supposed to help Tom do that. 
No matter what you say, I am convinced that I am right. 
Tom said he didn't need any more help. 
We cannot make a change in our schedule. 
I was shocked when I heard that Tom had been arrested. 
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there. 
I thought you could use a friend. 
You aren't really going to kill Tom, are you? 
They said that they'd be willing help us. 
Tom told me that he'd done that. 
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago. 
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today. 
I suspect that Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today. 
America's Civil War lasted four years. 
They say that they're disappointed. 
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil. 
Tom said he's going to try something he has never done before. 
I don't think Tom is strong. 
It's not too hard. 
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious. 
You're a prude. 
Tom said he would've done that if he could've. 
I don't think that anybody really wants to do that. 
Tom said that he wished he'd kissed Mary goodnight. 
If you do that, I will too. 
I think Tom is irreplaceable. 
They told me that they're tempted to do that. 
I don't think that I have everything that I need. 
That's not what Tom wanted you to do. 
Which book did you give to Tom? 
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year. 
Tom and Mary say that they're hoping that they can do that. 
I know that Tom expected me to do that. 
I wonder if Tom has ever been to Boston. 
It's not quite finished. 
Tom said he felt frustrated. 
I know that Tom will be doing that with Mary. 
I sent Mary some roses. 
Tom said that Mary was taller than her sister. 
I wasn't as hungry as Tom. 
Will you lend me your dictionary? 
I buy things that I know that I am not going to use. 
Tom claims that he didn't kill anyone. 
Tom and Mary said that they were very grateful. 
How are you doing today? 
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday. 
Tom told me that he's not going to do that. 
I know that Tom is a lot stronger than I am. 
It was not an easy decision. 
I wonder whether I'm still able do that. 
I knew that Tom didn't want me to do that. 
Tom didn't tell anyone anything. 
It's Tom's thirtieth birthday tomorrow. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary really did what John said she did. 
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian. 
They hoped that they'd be able to win. 
Tom said that he was glad that Mary could do that. 
I should have told you everything earlier. 
I thought you had another reason. 
I think you shouldn't have bought that car. 
Tom told Mary that he was unwilling to do that. 
I should've known Tom would be busy. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was thirty. 
Tom said he heard someone yelling. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary had to do that. 
Tom thought that I didn't have to do that. 
Nobody asked for your help. 
I thought Tom did that yesterday. 
Tom was not allowed to board the plane because he did not hold a valid travel document. 
Something isn't right. 
Tom believes Mary is trying to discredit him. 
Tom didn't seem too angry. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't through doing that yet. 
I think Tom won't be early. 
Tom told me Mary was nervous. 
Samurai lived by a code of honor. 
I know that Tom doesn't know when I did that. 
Tom said Mary has been here before. 
I can't believe Tom actually did that. 
I don't think that I've bought everything that I need. 
Tom said he didn't have anything to do. 
I should've noticed it before. 
I thought Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom wanted to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that we might have a problem. 
It rained for three days straight. 
Tom thought Mary was pregnant. 
When was the first time Tom did that? 
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that? 
We told everyone that we were moving to Australia. 
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. 
I don't think Tom is married anymore. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be alone. 
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
They say that they were hungry. 
Tom said that he should've done that. 
Tom was cremated. 
Tom said that he thought Mary had already finished doing that. 
Tom told me he thought that he might be able to do that. 
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife. 
I know that Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do that. 
Tom very rarely waits for anyone. 
I just assumed that everybody was going to do that. 
I don't think you understand what this means. 
It's not possible. 
I don't think you have the guts. 
I have been busy since yesterday. 
Tom said I shouldn't have tried doing that by myself. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't tried to do that. 
Tom was the one who told me I needed to do that. 
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30. 
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was creative. 
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't. 
I didn't know that Tom didn't want to do that alone. 
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else. 
I wonder whether Tom was able to do that by himself. 
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it. 
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that. 
You know I'm not good with secrets. 
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year. 
I would've talked to Tom instead of just ignoring him. 
I thought you'd want to meet my family. 
I don't think Tom will be disobedient. 
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired. 
There is not much I can do to help, I am afraid. 
Both Tom and Mary are still not married. 
I know that Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that. 
We are at school together. 
I would like you to look over these documents. 
Tom's tired. 
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer. 
Tom and Mary said they'd be going by train. 
I didn't know that Tom didn't really want to do that by himself. 
Tom said he was going to ask Mary to leave. 
Tom and Mary are going out for a walk after lunch. 
I know Tom is grouchy. 
Tom has passed out. 
Doing that would be hard. 
Tom said he didn't know anything about Mary. 
I thought Tom lived in Australia. 
I'm very surprised Tom didn't want to do that. 
Tom doesn't think you're going to be able to do that. 
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested. 
I don't think Tom is available. 
I don't think Tom is doing that. 
I wonder whether Tom is interested. 
I don't think Tom liked the song you wrote about him. 
I think I'll take this tie. 
Tom thought he might not be required to do that by himself. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary has never done that before. 
Tom gave me all the money I asked for. 
Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that by himself. 
The wood has become saturated with water. 
I don't think Tom understood. 
They said that they'd been handcuffed. 
Tom can do that, but Mary can't. 
I don't think it's a problem anymore. 
Tom told me that he thinks he'll do that tomorrow. 
I thought it would clear up in the afternoon. 
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30. 
I am an insomniac. 
Tom said he'll ask Mary if she wants to do that. 
I know that doesn't matter. 
Tom says Mary is trustworthy. 
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic. 
I know that I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway. 
I think Tom is the one who painted this fence. 
Tom must've thought Mary could speak French. 
He's a very affectionate father. 
How did Tom know Mary would do that? 
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble. 
Tom thinks it will rain tomorrow. 
I didn't know that Tom owned a gun. 
I thought there was a good chance that Tom would want to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would want your old bicycle. 
I wonder whether Tom knows who left this package on my desk. 
Tom should've been found guilty. 
It isn't working yet. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be angry. 
You're not really planning to help Tom, are you? 
Tom, it's not necessary to apologize. 
I'm already late. 
Tom knows he has a problem. 
I became a doctor so that I could help people. 
You cannot buy happiness. 
You promised that you'd do that. 
Tom said he thought Mary would be absent. 
It's not going to be as hard to do as you think it'll be. 
Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't like him. 
Are you over 18? 
Tom won't leave his children here with us. 
Tom didn't realize that we wanted to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that you were likely to do that. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might be required to do that the next time he travels. 
Tom said he did that for Mary. 
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that. 
Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John wants to do that or not. 
I thought things would get better. 
I hope Tom and Mary aren't quicker at doing that than me. 
Tom said that he's glad you're back. 
Tom said he thought Mary was unlikely to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conceited. 
The way you're planning to do that is dangerous. 
You should've come sooner. 
I think Tom is strong. 
Tom and Mary didn't know that they were supposed to be here yesterday. 
I seriously doubt Tom will be there. 
Tom said that he's really glad that he moved to Australia. 
I know that Tom is a forest ranger. 
It'll be hard for Tom to do that. 
They said that they'd only talk to you. 
French is her mother tongue. 
I don't think that Tom ought to do that alone. 
Tom picked up his bag and left. 
I'm not the only one here who's not married. 
Tom said that he knew he might not need to do that again. 
They know that they should do that today. 
You should've been a lawyer. 
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here. 
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party. 
I don't think that there's any reason Tom has to do that. 
Tom said Mary was likely to still be pessimistic. 
I don't think I could do that even if I tried. 
I know that Tom hasn't yet asked Mary to do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented. 
I don't think that doing that is a very good idea. 
I'm afraid Tom might not do what he's supposed to do. 
Tom said Mary didn't want to go to the concert. 
Tom told me that he'd drive Mary to the airport. 
Tom said he's driving to Boston on Monday. 
They told me that they're sleepy. 
I know that you and Tom will do that together. 
I think that this is the first time that Tom has done that. 
Tom hoped that he wouldn't be punished. 
I know that Tom is a very rich man. 
Tom must've been home at that time. 
I don't think I'm going to like being here. 
There's no hope. 
Tom could've gone camping with you if you'd let him know you were going. 
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he'd asked her not to. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was still interested in doing that. 
Are you good at reading maps? 
Tom says that Mary lies a lot. 
I doubt Tom will ever do that. 
I think that Tom is probably a pretty good lawyer. 
I thought I could do that without any help. 
You're pulling my leg. 
I thought you said you'd never try to do that by yourself. 
I don't think we'll do that by ourselves. 
I know that Tom will be the last one to do that. 
Tom said he'd give a book to Mary. 
I know that Tom didn't know why I was planning to do that. 
Tom didn't know that I was Mary's cousin. 
They said that they didn't know any French. 
I thought you might quit. 
I had no idea that Tom was planning to tell Mary not to do that. 
I thought you wanted to be a dancer. 
I don't think I'd be very good company. 
Tom says the party is over. 
It looks as if it's going to rain. 
Tom said I might not want to do that by myself. 
Safety is not guaranteed. 
Tom did not offer to help. 
I think Tom will be truthful. 
I assumed that Tom had told you that I would be here. 
Did you know I was going to get arrested? 
She is a despicable human being. 
Tom already intends to do that. 
Take off your school uniform. 
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that. 
I'm afraid I can't. 
I know that Tom is almost as tall as you. 
The first time I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old. 
Tom says Australia is his favorite country. 
I suspect Tom has never done that. 
I thought we could help out. 
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid? 
I'd like to stay longer. 
Tom plans on doing that today. 
You're the same age as I am. 
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that. 
Can you tell me who is coming tonight? 
Tom said he wished he'd given Mary flowers. 
They said that they had alibis. 
Tom was able to do what he needed to do. 
I knew you wouldn't like Australia. 
I couldn't think of anything. 
I wish you'd never told me. 
Tom won't know I'm here. 
I don't think you're as good of a driver as you say you are. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary had to do that. 
They told me that they were lonely. 
What's the time now? 
Tom said things went well. 
Tom told everyone that he didn't know how to speak French. 
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom was in the hospital. 
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that. 
I doubt we'll be able to prove that. 
I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom couldn't speak French. 
Tom was surprised that no one else was there. 
I'm not surprised Tom doesn't have to do that. 
He is not very good at the game of politics. 
Tom thought it would be funny to put an egg on Mary's chair. 
They said that they didn't feel hot. 
This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria. 
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon. 
Tom says he doesn't plan to do that. 
I thought you said nobody was going to be here. 
Tom thinks Mary is pushy. 
I'm skint. 
Is there anything I can do to help? 
Tom drank less than Mary did. 
Tom said that he assumed that Mary would want to do that. 
One cannot do lots of things at the same time. 
I can't remember her name. 
The father works. 
Tom and Mary say that they're not afraid. 
I'll save you a piece of pie. 
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech. 
It is a privilege to meet you. 
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do that. 
Tom said he thought you could help us today. 
I'm used to staying up late. 
I thought Tom looked happy. 
Tom said Mary should do that someplace else. 
Nobody seemed to want to do that. 
Tom said that he knew that he might not be required to do that by himself. 
No one told you about the meeting, did they? 
I'm aware this is Monday. 
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him. 
I think Tom was supposed to be here by now. 
I know that Tom and Mary are divorced. 
Tom must have seen us. 
I know that Tom doesn't know he isn't supposed to be doing that here. 
I know that Tom was going to do that in Australia last month. 
Tom has no reason not to do that. 
Mary told me that she thought Tom was handsome. 
I didn't know you'd be jealous. 
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat. 
They said that they didn't mind doing that. 
I'm afraid I have some bad news. 
I think Tom wants you to do that. 
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here. 
Tom and Mary said they're not sick. 
I knew Tom ought to do that outside. 
I wonder whether I should do that. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary know something is going on. 
I know exactly where I am going. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was retired. 
What's your last name? 
Tom told me that he thought Mary had left. 
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that. 
I know that Tom knows that Mary seldom does that anymore. 
You're braver than me. 
Tom said he was getting drowsy. 
They said that they tried to do that once. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks. 
I should've told Tom not to believe what Mary says. 
It would've been interesting to do that. 
If you had told me earlier, I would have dressed up. 
I think Tom is scared. 
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim. 
What's her problem? 
I think Tom is focused. 
I am not interested in this. 
I thought the police were looking for Tom. 
Why's everyone staring at me? 
Tom has everything he needs. 
They view foreigners with suspicion; I view everybody with suspicion. 
I don't think I can do that better than you. 
You could've let me know you were going to be late. 
Tom's delirious. 
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom. 
Tom would never do that. 
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today. 
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday. 
If I had known how to do it, I would've done it myself. 
Tom repaired his bicycle. 
You're not really planning on taking pictures, are you? 
He's two years younger than I. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were frustrated. 
I didn't know that Tom had to do that anymore. 
I thought that you said you've seen people doing that. 
It's obvious Tom is waiting for somebody. 
He does not watch TV at all. 
Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us. 
Give it back! 
Tom said he thought Mary might help us today. 
I thought the concert went pretty well. 
I can't cook at all. 
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do. 
I'm afraid your plan will not work. 
I don't think anybody saw us do that. 
Tom said he thought Mary might be able win. 
I wonder if Tom has another one. 
Everyone except Tom seemed to be having fun. 
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat. 
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that. 
I knew that Tom was finished doing that. 
I'm not sure that's possible. 
I don't think that Tom wants to go to Australia with me. 
I thought that Tom was still in school. 
I knew that Tom would be the next one to do that. 
They'll be glad that they didn't do that. 
They say that they'll buy that for you. 
They say that they don't need money. 
Tom is unwilling to go by himself. 
I know that Tom didn't need to do that with us. 
Everyone agrees it was the right decision. 
Tom got out of the bath and put his clothes on. 
I don't think Tom is planning on helping us. 
They say that they feel better now. 
I assume you'll be going to the dance with Tom. 
Tom thought I might be required to do that by myself. 
I don't think that that's anybody that I know. 
I don't think Tom did what you say he did. 
I don't think Tom knows everybody's name. 
I don't think it'll be difficult for Tom to do that. 
Tom said he doesn't know where Mary wants to go. 
Tom and Mary both lived in Australia when they were kids. 
Tom really thought that we didn't need to do that. 
It's not good for anybody. 
Tom said he often thinks about leaving. 
Do Tom and Mary know that you don't like them? 
I know I've been very stupid. 
Tom and Mary are both full-time students. 
I know that Tom and only Tom needs to do that. 
Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today. 
I suspect Tom and Mary don't like me very much. 
I wonder whether I can do that. 
Tom really thought that we wanted to do that. 
I wish I could visit Australia. 
She is eating. 
He's the love of my life. 
I think that Tom is a good painter. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is making for dinner. 
It wasn't that hard to find a pair of shoes that fit. 
I never would've let Tom do that. 
I've promised Tom that I'd go to Australia with him. 
Tom sings better than me. 
Tom said he had a difficult day. 
Do you feel like going swimming? 
Tom and Mary still hope that they can win. 
Tom knows we can't win. 
I don't think I could do that. 
You are to blame. 
I thought you said your car was stolen. 
I didn't know that Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary. 
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children. 
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't either. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was funny. 
I know that Tom didn't know that Mary should do that. 
I wonder whether Tom really stayed in Boston last summer. 
In his heart, Tom knew that he would never return. 
We're not ready to go home yet. 
Tom should've eaten more. 
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that in the near future. 
I didn't think that we had enough food to feed everyone. 
I should've listened to what my mother said. 
Tom is wasting time. 
I think Tom was exaggerating. 
I was convinced that I shouldn't do that. 
Tom said Mary is probably still nervous. 
If this is madness, there is method in it. 
Tom told me everything that I needed to know. 
They told everybody they were upset. 
Tom said he won't do that unless I help him. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was sincere. 
She knows about stuff like that. 
I don't think I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking. 
I suspect Tom and Mary are ready to do that. 
What's the name of your pharmacy? 
I don't think anybody else wants to come. 
I knew that Tom was very busy. 
Tom said that he thought I might not need to do that until October. 
What is worrying you, Tom? 
Tom is a traveling salesman. 
I suspect Tom isn't in Boston anymore. 
Tom is convinced that he needs to do that. 
This is the first time that I've visited Australia. 
I knew that Tom didn't know that he didn't really have to do that. 
Everyone knows that we killed Tom. 
Tom said he'd rather not go to Australia with us. 
Dinner isn't ready yet. 
I hope I'll be able to help you tomorrow. 
Sure we could do that, but it would be really difficult to do. 
I could have saved Tom's life. 
There's a good chance that Tom will ask Mary to the dance. 
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library. 
I don't think we can take care of ourselves. 
Do you need a lift? 
I thought I made my reasons clear. 
Tom is someone I look up to. 
Tom says that he's sorry that he broke his promise. 
I think I have just about enough money to buy the computer that I want. 
I realize that Tom will try to do that. 
I'm very glad to see you. 
They said that they're cold. 
I know that Tom knows I don't have to do that. 
Tom has just done what he should've done last week. 
Tom says that he doesn't usually wear underwear. 
I know that Tom is a better musician than Mary. 
Tom said that he thought that he knew what Mary planned on doing. 
Tom and Mary said they'd win and they did. 
No one knew that but Tom. 
Tom thought Mary wasn't cold. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary still lived in Australia. 
I thought Tom would be happy about that. 
I know that Tom would permit you to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't asleep. 
Tom goes to Boston every chance he gets. 
I know that Tom never considered doing that. 
Didn't you know that I was hoping that Tom would do that? 
They said that they'll call you later. 
I promise that we'll be listening to everything you say. 
I think you will enjoy it there. 
It's not all that ridiculous. 
I wonder whether we have to do that. 
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to do that today. 
The fuse has blown. 
Tom and Mary weren't able to help me do that. 
Tom should've been interested. 
I wonder whether Tom really wants me to do that today. 
It isn't good to ridicule people in public. 
We should've planned for this. 
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that. 
They say that they never did that. 
Tom and Mary said they isn't going to do that. 
I know Tom is connected. 
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia. 
Let's get married. 
Get the fuck out! 
I think Tom has been to Boston at least one time. 
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow. 
I wasn't as helpful as I should've been. 
Tom said Mary was living in Australia. 
They told me that they don't like to study in the morning. 
You tricked me! 
We are too busy for that, Tom. 
Is this seat empty? 
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that. 
You're free to go. 
I know that Tom is confident. 
Tom thinks it's pretty good. 
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning. 
Tom may be lying. 
I heard Tom is living in Australia. 
Nobody told me I wasn't supposed to park there. 
Tom could've taken the money. 
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise. 
Make sure nobody enters. 
I doubt that'll ever change. 
Tom told everybody that he was bored. 
It was clear that Tom was going to do that with Mary. 
I suspect Tom is drunk. 
I met somebody yesterday who knows that we. 
Tom told me he didn't have insurance. 
I'm hoping that I can live here with you. 
Those agenda items were taken up en bloc for discussion. 
Tom said he felt good about that. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen. 
You know that I need to do that, don't you? 
They must have found out who I was. 
I don't think I passed the test. 
I knew that Tom was a bad loser. 
I don't think Tom is dead. 
They said that they didn't feel anything. 
I knew Tom would like Mary. 
I don't think Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him. 
Tom said that he thought he wouldn't be able to win. 
My impression of America is very good. 
I don't like anybody bothering when I'm working. 
They remained friends. 
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be back soon. 
Tom said he wished he hadn't permitted Mary to do that. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was having fun. 
Tom said that he thought Mary didn't like John very much. 
I don't think Tom can do that without some help. 
Doing that isn't difficult. 
I'm very sorry I kissed Tom. 
I'm horrified. 
Tom told me that he was very hungry when he got home. 
Tom said Mary would likely not know how to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows he's not supposed to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary were planning to do that. 
Tom said he heard three shots fired. 
I think you're stuck-up. 
Didn't you know that Tom had a dog? 
I knew that Tom wouldn't want to stop doing that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they'd lied. 
Tom's a bully, just like John is. 
I'm sure that Tom that was going to happen. 
I'm a friend of Tom's. 
I thought Tom would've forgotten me by now. 
They say that they're working very hard. 
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not. 
I don't think I can move to Boston until next year. 
The only person who could have done this is Tom. 
They told me that they were well. 
I thought if I broke up with you, I'd never have to see you again. 
I am decorating the classroom. 
I know that Tom knew that Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they were depressed. 
Tom knows that I don't like him. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that I have to do that. 
Tom said I should've left earlier. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary could've done that by herself. 
Tom said that he thought that he forgot to lock the door. 
It's hard to do that, isn't it? 
The present I got from Tom was the best. 
I don't think I have enough money. 
Tom wasn't given the chance that you and I were given. 
How did you know Tom was planning on doing that? 
Will you give me one pen? 
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet. 
I have a feeling that I have been here before. 
Tom was rude to everyone. 
Tom said Mary is probably still alive. 
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done? 
Tom and Mary didn't tell anyone that they'd won the lottery. 
Is there any possibility Tom will want to do that with us? 
Tom and Mary both like old movies. 
Tom and Mary said they could do that today. 
Tom woke the children up and told them to get ready for school. 
I don't like you. 
Tom said he thought Mary would be hungry. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might not want to do that by himself. 
I didn't know that you were planning on doing that while you were in Australia. 
I don't think Tom rides his motorcycle anymore. 
Tom said he doesn't feel like doing that. 
I know that Tom doesn't know why I did that on Monday. 
Tom apparently should've done that. 
I don't think that Tom knows that he'll never be able to do that. 
I cannot put up with the noise any longer. 
I know that Tom didn't know that we wouldn't be able to do that. 
I hope you already know what to do. 
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't go to Australia? 
Tom said he thought that it would be better if we didn't do that here. 
Tom said he didn't want to leave. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be at home. 
You're a better chess player than me. 
Tom said he liked the idea. 
I am going to watch TV this evening. 
I think Tom is a few months older than Mary is. 
I think you know Tom already. 
I should've kissed Tom. 
I know that Tom knows why I need to do that. 
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake. 
Tom thought Mary wasn't yet finished doing that. 
I wonder if Tom was able to do that. 
If I'd taken that plane, I wouldn't be alive now. 
I don't think Tom would enjoy this movie. 
I'm certain that your intentions are honorable. 
I know Tom is about the same weight as I am. 
Tom said he didn't know why the meeting was postponed. 
You should've taken his advice. 
They say that they like doing that. 
I know that someone needs to do that. 
Tom told me Mary wasn't afraid to do that. 
I hope Tom isn't tired. 
They said that they were conservative. 
I don't think I'll be scared. 
I know that Tom can't actually do that even though he says he can. 
We could've done it by ourselves. 
I thought maybe you'd have an idea. 
Tom and Mary said that they were heartbroken. 
I wonder whether Tom is really at home. 
I know that Tom knows that I'm not supposed to be doing that. 
Both Tom and I haven't yet done that. 
Don't pick your nose. 
I've got to do something with these radishes. 
Tom pled guilty and was deported. 
I didn't know you needed to do that. 
Tom says he plans on staying in Australia as long as he can. 
I don't think there's any way I can help you. 
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't forgive him. 
I don't think I can help you do that. 
I know that Tom is the kind of guy who'd do that. 
I suspect Tom will help Mary do that. 
Tom said he didn't know how Mary would do that. 
I won't tell anybody you're in Australia. 
Tom said he didn't want to do that alone. 
Tom said Mary didn't look too worried. 
Tom can swim much faster than Mary. 
Tom would've done that correctly the first time if you'd helped him. 
I am accustomed to cold weather. 
I think that Tom hurt his leg. 
I know that Tom didn't know he should do that. 
The current political situation is not very stable. 
Tom said his son was a good athlete. 
Tom and Mary said they weren't jealous. 
Tom's contract expires October 20th. 
I don't think Tom would be nervous doing that. 
I know that Tom is a Red Cross volunteer. 
I knew Tom wouldn't do what we asked him to do. 
They told me that they were ready to do that. 
I don't think Tom really did that all by himself. 
How did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week? 
I thought Tom wasn't surprised. 
I thought that you said we weren't going to sing. 
They said that they'll do that soon. 
I know that the last thing that you want to do is hurt me. 
I can't believe you wanted to do that. 
I have the impression that Tom is doing well. 
Tom didn't know that Mary was John's girlfriend. 
They said that they were very sick. 
I know that Tom did that once. 
Tom is waiting. 
I think both Tom and Mary have never done that. 
I knew I should've studied French. 
Tom said you're stubborn. 
Maybe next time! 
I think Tom is lying. 
I know that Tom knows I shouldn't be doing that. 
I thought you might be in Australia this week. 
I'm sorry that I made you wait for so long today. 
Tom thinks Mary is glad that that's going to happen. 
It is not until you get sick that you realize the value of good health. 
I thought I'd broken my leg, but an X-ray showed that I hadn't. 
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that. 
There isn't much we can do to help. 
I don't think Tom understood what we wanted him to do. 
I don't know what it is. 
I wonder whether Tom knew I had to do that. 
I doubt that the police are going to arrest Tom. 
I have lived here for thirty years. 
Tom told me he hated doing that. 
Tom said he thought I was dead. 
Tom said I don't need to do that. 
They told me that they'd do that for us. 
Tom said that Mary knew that John might be allowed to do that. 
I'm not proud of my behaviour. 
Tom said he didn't have your permission to do that. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to talk. 
I don't think Tom liked your song very much. 
I would've done that if I could've. 
They said that they wouldn't try to do that. 
I don't think Tom and Mary have much in common. 
Tom didn't know that Mary was planning on doing that. 
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal. 
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be cooperative. 
Something's very wrong here. 
I didn't know that Tom lived in the dormitory. 
I thought you'd want to see this. 
Tom told me he wasn't planning to join the team. 
I hope Tom is glad that's going to happen. 
They told me that they'd likely do that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were free. 
Tom said Mary would probably go to Australia with him. 
Tom wouldn't have done that even if he'd wanted to. 
Boston isn't at all like Chicago. 
I really should've told Tom not to go to Boston. 
I think my neighbour may have died. 
I don't think Tom has done that yet. 
I don't think Tom would be late unless he had a very good reason. 
Tom's cooking. 
Tom said he thought Mary would be cold. 
Tom said that he thought we could win. 
I don't trust governments. 
I didn't think there was anybody I knew in Australia. 
Do you think I should go to Australia with Tom? 
I think Tom should stay here with us. 
I don't think Tom is going to be a problem anymore. 
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother? 
I don't think I know that guy. 
Tom said he planned on going on Monday. 
I'm afraid that I might be late. 
I put my helmet on. 
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything. 
I knew that Tom would be able to do that if he really needed to. 
Tom thinks you're going to be here tomorrow. 
Everybody knows Tom is lying. 
Tom must've seen it. 
Tom may be a traitor. 
I knew Tom would unlikely agree to do that. 
They must have arrived home by this time. 
Tom told me that he's going to talk to Mary about that. 
I thought you weren't going to tell anyone. 
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's shoe size is. 
She'll do that if nobody stops her. 
Put your guns down! 
She's my first love. 
In summer, eggs soon go bad. 
I have taught my dog to sit up and beg. 
I promise that I won't tell anyone where it is. 
Tom thought we shouldn't go. 
Tom is not as fat as I am. 
Nobody's listening anymore. 
I thought you were Tom's friend. 
They said that they felt very lonely. 
I don't think I'm unlucky. 
Tom announced that he wasn't going to do that. 
Tom really should've stayed where he was. 
Tom thinks Mary won't teach French. 
Tom told me he was fine. 
Tom said he wasn't disappointed. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't convinced Mary to do that. 
Tom said that Mary knew that John might have to do that by himself. 
Have you ever been stuck in an elevator? 
Tom said he tries to be optimistic. 
Tom said that he wished that you wouldn't do that again. 
Doing that will be a lot harder than you think. 
Tom said he didn't mean to hit me. 
All hope abandon ye who enter here. 
I'll see if Tom is in his office. 
Tom and Mary said they prefers red wine. 
Tom and Mary say they may not have to do that. 
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is hurt you. 
You are better than me. 
I wonder if Tom will be OK. 
Since my husband became sick he's lost 20 kilograms and his pants are now baggy. 
Tom has never had a problem with anybody. 
Tom would've eaten more if he'd had time. 
I think I'd like that. 
Tom said that he thought that he'd be able to do that on October 20th. 
I know that deep down you're a good person. 
Tom assumed that everybody at school knew that he'd been arrested. 
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that to Alice. 
There is no doubt that I could not do it without your help. 
I wish that I didn't have to throw this away. 
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that. 
Do you think Tom would like to go camping with us next weekend? 
Must I answer in English? 
I think Tom hasn't agreed to do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was talented. 
I think you know Tom isn't going to be here today. 
Tom said that he had to work on October 20th. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was unhappy in Australia. 
I want you to know that I'll work very hard. 
Tom looks older than he really is. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary was lazy. 
I have a load of work to do before I can go home. 
All we can do now is hope that Tom does what he's promised to do. 
I haven't read it. 
I don't think Tom really wants to do that anymore. 
I thought you didn't want to talk about this. 
They've got a green carpet in the living room. 
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that. 
You are the next in line for promotion. 
Didn't you know that Tom used to be married to Mary? 
Tom said he liked doing that. 
Tom and Mary swore they didn't do that. 
I know that Tom doesn't know why he should do that. 
Tom must've gone ahead. 
Tom thought it over carefully. 
The police suspect that Tom was murdered. 
I doubt that Tom is still unconscious. 
I know that Tom isn't used to sitting on the floor. 
I have created a few websites. 
Tom said Mary likes driving. 
We are trying to close the box. 
I know that Tom will be through doing that. 
Tom said he hasn't yet done any of that. 
I think Tom is over thirty. 
I didn't know that you were planning on doing that so soon. 
We should've done what you advised. 
I thought that you said you hated doing that. 
Tom told me he wasn't an expert. 
I know that Tom wouldn't ask Mary not to do that. 
Christmas is just around the corner. 
Tom is not very likely to want to do that. 
Tom is the smartest person I've ever met. 
A man called on you last night. 
I am a bit drunk. 
They're not as tough as they look. 
I guess this is a step in the right direction. 
I'll make sure that Tom does that sometime today. 
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her. 
I haven't understood anything that you've said. 
You should've left while you had the chance. 
I thought that you said you had a dog. 
No one is out of the woods yet. 
Tom said we could go to Boston with him if we wanted to. 
That won't change anything. 
Tom is being mean. 
We didn't know that Tom was going to do that. 
I didn't know you were still planning on doing that. 
Hi, everybody! 
I don't think that anybody would agree to do that 
Tom couldn't believe that his vacation was over so quickly. 
You cannot make bricks without straw. 
I do not play tennis as much as I used to. 
Tom said Mary wouldn't likely be mad. 
Tom and Mary say that they hope you win. 
I asked Tom if he knew anybody who taught French. 
I am bored out of my mind. 
Tom should've done what Mary told him to do. 
Tom is someone you can trust. 
I knew that Tom told Mary to ask John not to do that. 
Tom and Mary say that they'll help us today. 
I will stay home if it rains tomorrow. 
If I had done my best, I might have succeeded. 
I know that both Tom and Mary have finished doing that. 
Tom would've done that if you'd asked him to. 
I know that Tom is a lot smarter than Mary is. 
How much did you spend per day when you were in Australia? 
I hope I'm able to do that. 
I meant it when I said I wanted to marry you. 
I don't think anybody was satisfied. 
It looks like someone has ripped a page out of this book. 
I knew that Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that. 
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you now. 
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourself. 
He is a man who gets things done. 
I hope that you'll be my friends. 
Tom said he wanted to try riding a unicycle. 
I figured you might know why Tom left early. 
Tom assumed everybody knew that he'd spent time in prison. 
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are. 
They said that they were very worried. 
They told me that they were hungry. 
It'll be done by the time you get here. 
Tom may not have died in the accident. 
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to find another job. 
I thought that only happened in fairytales. 
I don't think that Tom was busy today. 
Tom said that he assumed Mary wouldn't cry. 
I'll be there on the twentieth. 
I don't think that it's likely Tom will help us. 
Tom must've cried. 
Tom has lost both of his parents. 
Tom said he could've done that on his own. 
I doubt if doing that will be hard. 
We must defeat our enemies. 
Tom's upset. 
They told everyone that they were suspicious. 
I knew you wouldn't like it in Australia. 
I know that I couldn't do that even if I tried. 
I don't think I can move this bookcase without some help. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was having a good time in Australia. 
I know that Tom is a hockey fan. 
Tom said that he knew that was what Mary wanted to do. 
I don't think that Tom knows I think he's stupid. 
I hope Tom and I aren't inconveniencing you. 
Tom told me that he thought Mary knew French. 
Tom said he needed to be more careful. 
I thought you and Tom didn't like each other. 
You ought to tell Tom you aren't planning to swim. 
Tom assumed that everybody knew that Mary couldn't understand French. 
Is it true Tom thinks I believe that? 
I love playing my guitar. 
They said that they'll never leave early. 
I didn't know that Tom would be able to do that by himself. 
Tom may be desperate. 
The road is parallel to the river. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary know that something interesting is about to happen. 
Tom let Mary know he needed to do that. 
Don't let anybody in. 
Tom said he felt tempted to do that. 
I'm not sure I'm ready for this. 
Tom is in this picture, too. 
Tom said he didn't know why Mary didn't enjoy the movie. 
Tom said he might possibly win. 
I don't think Tom and Mary are planning to help us. 
That isn't a bad option.

Tom looked angry when Mary said that. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary should do that again. 
Tom said that he wanted to know if I could swim. 
"Is it true?" "I think so!" 
I'm not sure it'll do you any good. 
Tom said Mary isn't pessimistic. 
I would like to report a crime. 
I didn't know that Tom didn't know French. 
I know that Tom didn't know I knew how to do that. 
Tom told me that I should do that soon. 
I'm afraid I can't help you. 
I know I'm not alone. 
They're not as innocent as they seem. 
We do not have snow here. 
I didn't think Tom would help us do that. 
Tom said Mary is probably still heartbroken. 
They may do that if they want to. 
I know that Tom is a very shy boy. 
Tom knew that I was angry. 
That is all I have. 
Tom doesn't want anybody to know he's going to Australia. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary really had to go yesterday morning. 
I promise you I won't be late. 
I knew that Tom had to do that by himself. 
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that. 
You could've done that yourself. 
I wonder if the weather will hold. 
It would've been romantic to do that. 
I know Tom is a much better drummer than I am. 
For here, please. 
Tom said that he thought that it would be dangerous for Mary to walk home by herself at night. 
Did you know that Tom was going to do that with Mary? 
Tom told everybody that he was glad that that was going to happen. 
I know that Tom can swim better than I can. 
Tom and Mary told me they had to go.

Good job, everyone. 
They must know I'm innocent. 
You don't allow your kids to do that, do you? 
Tom is big-headed. 
I don't think I should tell Tom that I'm going to Boston. 
He likes playing football.

I know that Tom is a lot stronger than Mary is. 
Tom thought the burning car would explode. 
Do you really think Tom is determined to do that? 
Tom could be in Australia a long time. 
I think Tom could do that if he tried. 
No one knew that you were in Australia. 
No one has been injured yet. 
I don't think it's up to us to decide. 
You're handsome. 
This is the first time I've ridden a horse. 
They said that they like to do that. 
Stand back, please. 
Tom tried hard to calm everyone down. 
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man. 
Those who know me know I can't do that. 
The first time that I held my girlfriend's hand was on the school bus. 
Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that early tomorrow morning. 
Tom already knows that Mary is planning to stay in Australia for another three days.

I know that you won't enjoy doing that. 
Has anyone ever told you what really happened? 
I am an artist. 
Tom won't allow anyone to do that. 
The report is not quite finished. 
They said that they got out of the way. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom has never been a patient of mine. 
Tom bought every painting that Mary painted. 
I know that Tom knows that Mary did that. 
We won't be able to evade punishment this time. 
I expected Tom wouldn't do anything. 
Tom said Mary could've done that on her own. 
They say that they'll never do that again. 
They say that they'll sing. 
I should have read the insurance policy more carefully.

Wait here until I get back.

When she came to the place where the footpath led across the moor, she found small pools of water, and a great deal of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and trod upon it, that she might pass without wetting her feet. 
Tom thought Mary did that on purpose. 
Tom must've been showing off. 
Tom was paid more than he expected to be paid. 
This blackboard is not black, but green. 
Everyone waited. 
They were not sympathetic. 
That is the fastest train in the world.

I suspect that Tom doesn't do his homework by himself. 
Tom said he didn't have any trouble doing that. 
I don't think Tom knows where Mary studies French.

Tom made some mistakes in the test. 
She made up her mind to go to America. 
I thought Tom would've remembered today's meeting. 
I am going to play soccer tomorrow.

Tom should've been in Australia when he had the chance. 
It's not a computer problem.
