She's not a good cook. 
Tom said that he isn't in any hurry. 
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that 
I didn't know that you weren't Canadians. 
Come watch us play music sometime. 
Tom said that he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that. 
Tom said that Mary was too busy to help you do that today. 
Tom told me that he'd complain about that. 
Tom is a member of my housing co-op. 
Tom drove down the street Mary lives on, hoping to see her. 
I'm sure it wasn't difficult to do that. 
You know as well as I do that there's no chance Tom will do that. 
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't. 
I know Tom might need to do that by himself. 
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to. 
It would have been tiring to do that. 
Tom must have told us the truth. 
Tom said he didn't think that Mary ought to have done that. 
We'll have to do something. 
When do you plan on doing that? 
Tom said that he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week. 
Tom knew that he'd be punished. 
I don't think I've ever seen anyone doing that before. 
That's not hard. 
I'm afraid that we don't have any left. 
Tom told me that I should learn how to play the drums. 
We haven't yet succeeded. 
I have never been to Paris. 
Tom said that he had eaten nothing, but that wasn't true. 
I am an atheist. 
Tom said that Mary was at home in bed with a cold. 
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that. 
Tom said that Mary knew that she might have to do that on her own. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was puzzled. 
Tom said that he'd be glad to do that for you. 
Tom said that I looked a bit pale. 
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be confused. 
Tom thought that Mary was alone. 
I know that Tom is hiding something from me. 
Did you know Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty year old? 
I wonder whether Tom knows Mary wants to do that. 
I'm sure that Tom will be back. 
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th. 
I know Tom knows that he doesn't have to do that. 
Why is everybody staring at us? 
I know Tom didn't know who had done that to Mary. 
I reason Tom did that was because everyone else in his family did. 
Everyone knows I don't like Tom. 
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe. 
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you. 
I would've left early if I could have. 
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here. 
I don't think that you'd enjoy doing that. 
Tom hasn't yet talked to Mary about that. 
I don't think that Tom is handsome. 
Tom was the only one sleeping. 
Tom said he thought that Mary wasn't asleep. 
I never should have let you go home alone last night. 
I think I'm going to have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow. 
Tom said that you were really good at tennis. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was autistic. 
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you. 
I know Tom is a lot more creative than Mary is. 
I know that Tom is a lot more creative than me. 
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that. 
I think that you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers. 
Tom said that he's desperate. 
Tom said that I don't have to do that this afternoon. 
Tom said that it was a good time to leave. 
I know Tom is frightened. 
You can't appreciate the poem until you've read it many times. 
I did that deliberately. 
Tom never should have left early. 
She's already married. 
This is blasphemy. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't awake. 
Tom said that he's glad that he was able to do that. 
You can't buy one of those for less than $30.00. 
Do you think that Tom would like to go to Australia with us? 
Tom said he likes dancing with Mary. 
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that. 
Tom must have seen us doing that. 
I doubt Tom will run for president. 
Tom should have done this yesterday. 
Tom might be angry. 
Tom said that Mary won't be mad. 
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him. 
Tom said that he didn't live in Australia anymore. 
I know Tom knew he didn't need to do that. 
I hope I haven't forgotten anybody. 
Tom said Mary knew that she might not need to do that. 
I didn't think Tom would be so mad. 
I thought that you liked romance novels. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are bored. 
Tom has been told about the problem already. 
I know that Tom was disobedient. 
I don't know anyone who hates Tom. 
Tom said that he thinks I'd be able to win. 
I was in Boston three years ago. 
I don't think that I could do what Tom is doing. 
Why doesn't anybody listen to me? 
Wealth doesn't interest me. 
Tom said that he thought that I seemed impressed. 
Tom said that he had no objection to our leaving early. 
It's not for beginners. 
Tom and Mary told everyone they were depressed. 
I think that Tom doesn't know how to swim. 
Tom has lots of friends here. 
Tom knows that he cheated. 
I think Tom used to be a member of our club. 
Where's your notebook? 
I don't think that I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today. 
It isn't likely Tom will ever admit he's wrong. 
How many kilometers is it from here to the train station? 
I don't think that that story is true. 
He often adopts the behaviors and speech patterns that characterize the advantaged. 
Tom said that you were his friend. 
I'm thinking of having dinner at 6:00. 
Tom told Mary that he'd be doing that tomorrow. 
I know that Tom is through. 
Tom said that Mary's dog bit him. 
Tom said that he was through doing that. 
Tom said that he's appealing his suspension. 
He's deeply attached to her. 
I thought that you'd show me how to do that. 
I'm telling you that we have to assume Tom is dead. 
Mary has a hairdresser's appointment. 
Tom said that Mary thought that she might be allowed to do that today. 
You don't have to come if you don't want to. 
It smells like someone has been smoking a cigar in here. 
We're just in time for the last train. 
I think that question isn't appropriate. 
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child? 
I don't think that anybody noticed what we were doing. 
What're we going to do? 
I could have cried. 
There is no free lunch. 
I thought you said that we weren't going to go to Boston with Tom. 
Tom's quitting smoking. 
I think I know what Tom's doing here. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd be glad to help. 
I'm now fairly certain that's not going to happen. 
They aren't as fussy as they used to be. 
We go to school every day except Sunday. 
Tom told me Mary wasn't hungry. 
Tom thought he probably wasn't going to survive. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was bilingual. 
Tom said he thought that he'd forgotten to lock the door. 
Tom told Mary she should wash her car. 
They said they didn't want to argue. 
Tom admitted that he had done what he was accused of doing. 
Are both of you Canadians? 
Why would anybody want to kiss Tom? 
I knew Tom had never actually done that. 
They said they had no other details. 
Tom thought Mary liked me, but I knew she hated me. 
Tom thinks that I need to go. 
Tom told everyone that he didn't understand French. 
They said they don't like to do that. 
Not everybody hugged Tom. 
Everyone needed to do that. 
I thought Tom looked a little pale. 
I turned the lights off. 
She's addicted to shopping. 
Tom said that Mary was going back home to Australia. 
Tom told me that he wasn't sleepy. 
Tom thought that Mary was listening, but she wasn't. 
I thought that you said that Tom was a barber. 
I wonder whether this really works. 
Let's get to the point! 
Did you give Tom the key? 
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him that she had to do that. 
My father's a doctor. 
I don't think that I'd like being married to Tom. 
I didn't know that you couldn't sing. 
Tom frequently does that alone. 
I've learned a lot from this conversation. 
I thought that Tom would buy that car. 
Tom and Mary said that they're very busy right now. 
Tom said he was planning to stay at home all day. 
Tom should've apologized to Mary. 
Tom said that he believed Mary. 
I'm afraid I can't finish this report on time. 
Tom was about thirty when he moved to Boston. 
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary needs to do that. 
Everybody here but Tom and Mary has done that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was satisfied. 
Tom said that he was going to help us do that. 
Tom's house is very close to mine. 
The host carved the turkey for the guests. 
I know Tom doesn't know that he doesn't really have to do that. 
I think Tom will be able to understand that. 
I'm still undecided. 
I know that isn't worth doing. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary had been rude. 
It isn't wrong. 
Tom and Mary told me that they felt offended. 
I'm really grateful to you. 
Tom is wicked. 
I knew Tom wasn't as good a student as Mary. 
Mary told me she was at home. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might want to do that. 
I know that Tom is forgetful. 
Tom said that Mary was mad. 
Tom says he isn't guilty. 
No one laughed at Tom's joke. 
Tom said that isn't his biggest problem. 
We're planning on going tomorrow. 
I think that Tom snores louder than Mary. 
What're you trying to do? 
We didn't know whether Tom and Mary were busy or not. 
Tom and Mary said that they planned to go. 
You'd better take off your shoes. 
I didn't think that we did anything wrong. 
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that. 
Tom has already decided he's going to sign the contract. 
Is it true you were there? 
What do you think Tom would have done? 
They say they aren't coming. 
Tom said that he was really glad he'd been asked to do that. 
I think Tom will likely be there tonight. 
Tom said he may possibly do that. 
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't ever do that again. 
I expect that Tom is crying right now. 
You're really an angel. 
Tom has already decided that he isn't going to try to escape. 
Tom told Mary either he or she had to do that. 
Tom has already decided that he isn't going to do that. 
Tom is a terrible joke teller, because he often forgets the punchline. 
Both Tom and I are hungry. 
Tom and Mary say that they won't do that for you. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was trustworthy. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still scared. 
Tom and Mary said that they did that on Monday. 
Tom doesn't know I've never done that. 
Tom told me I should go to Boston with Mary. 
Tom and Mary live with their dad in Boston. 
I know that Tom is missing. 
I would have liked to do that. 
It won't be so difficult to do that. 
Don't let Tom do that alone. 
I was so excited. 
Tom's a party animal. 
I thought that it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party. 
Tom won't likely need to do that today. 
I hope that I don't need to do that. 
Tom must have changed a lot. 
Nobody is better at this than me. 
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell he was angry. 
I know Tom knows that he shouldn't do that here. 
He's here. 
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary is now. 
My wife is a scientist, too. 
I turned off the computer. 
Tom and Mary told me that they weren't prepared. 
Tom said Mary is probably still angry. 
I'm quite sure that Tom has relatives in Australia. 
Tom could've very easily waited for us. 
Tom told me that he didn't need to use a wheelchair anymore. 
I thought you said that you didn't do that. 
Tom said he'd help me. 
I know Tom isn't in bed yet. 
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake. 
They aren't here. They went home. 
Tom said he thought that Mary wasn't interested in sports. 
Tom was unimpressed. 
Tom didn't realize Mary didn't like him. 
Tom and Mary said that everyone they know can swim. 
I also don't think that Tom is going to do that. 
Tom was the only one who knew what had happened to Mary. 
Where do you intend to do that? 
I didn't know that you'd be through doing that by 2:30. 
Tom said that he'd be thirteen next month. 
I wish I were by your side. 
Get your paws off me. 
I'm afraid that I have to refuse. 
I know that you recently retired. 
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that. 
I wonder if we'll really do that today. 
Tom is sleeping. 
You're a good boy. 
I should have just walked right in. 
I don't think that you've been listening to me. 
We're brother and sister. 
I don't think that Tom is finished doing that. 
I don't think we've done anything illegal. 
I don't think I've ever seen anybody try it before. 
Don't you have a television? 
Don't give up. 
I don't play the mandolin as well as you do. 
Tom said he thought that Mary might not be required to do that anymore. 
I don't know why you can't admit you need me. 
The feeling's mutual. 
Tom has known Mary since he was a child. 
Tom said that he expects to do that on Monday. 
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary. 
I think that Tom will go to Boston next week. 
It's not far away from the hotel. 
I've got to find it. 
Tom said that he didn't have many friends in Australia. 
Tom said that Mary wasn't safe. 
Tom could have used the help. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be frightened by that. 
Tom wasn't surprised Mary was asking him for a divorce. 
Tom says he's lonely. 
I knew Tom was a better student than Mary. 
I'm Jack. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd be tempted to do that. 
Tom said that isn't the main reason Mary has to do that. 
Tom said that he plans on staying in Australia. 
There is a downhill after every uphill. 
I knew Tom might want to learn how to do that. 
Tom and Mary say that they also need to do that. 
I am not married yet. 
Tom hasn't yet been told that he isn't required to do that. 
I suspect that Tom will have to do that next week. 
I promised Tom that I'd be there by 2:30. 
Winning is always difficult. 
I'm driving a truck. 
I'm certain that's not the case. 
Tom had no idea that Mary was planning on staying in Boston for a few weeks. 
I love the fact that Tom is back in Australia. 
Tom says that he didn't do anything wrong. 
Tom said that he'd probably do that the day after tomorrow. 
They said they weren't unhappy. 
Tom said that Mary isn't furious. 
I haven't yet finished my supper. 
Tom didn't know you would be there. 
I don't know whether Tom and Mary plan on doing that or not. 
I don't think that Tom is still asleep. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary really knows how to do that very well. 
I'm sure Tom feels the same way that you do. 
Tom said that he feels sick. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be required to do that. 
I hope nobody followed you. 
Tom knows he should have been able to do that better. 
I know that Tom will be motivated to do that. 
Do you think we should have talked to Tom about this? 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't given Mary any money. 
Tom might not be able to do that. 
I know that you aren't enjoying yourself here. 
Kindergarten children act better than some adults do. 
I thought maybe we could travel together. 
I thought that I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say. 
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary is planning to do that. 
Tom wanted everyone to know he was unhappy. 
I know Tom wanted me to do that. 
You seem busy. 
Both Tom and Mary looked at John. 
They think they're stronger than me. 
I read about it in the paper. 
How do I get better? 
Tom doesn't like to do that. 
They told me they'd be discreet. 
I should have written it down. 
I am no longer hungry. 
You CAN do it. 
Tom likes keeping things to himself. 
I don't think everyone has given up. 
I thought that you had convinced Tom to help us. 
I'm sorry that I couldn't come to Tom's funeral. 
I am very happy. 
I know Tom will be doing that today. 
I know some of your students don't like you. 
Kyoko was kind enough to carry my baggage for me. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was hurt. 
Tom said that Mary knew he might not have to do that by himself. 
It isn't very likely to rain tomorrow. 
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that next winter. 
I don't know what it means. 
I think that it's more important to discuss possible solutions. 
I didn't realize that Tom and Mary both should do that. 
Do both Tom and Mary snore? 
It's way past the time that Tom promised that he'd be here. 
We're not going on vacation. 
I don't think that I'll be able to do what I want to do. 
I think that Tom is handling it well. 
Tom and I know Mary wants to do that tomorrow. 
I don't think that I can explain the difference. 
Tom said that he thought it would be better if we didn't do that. 
I thought that everybody here was a vegetarian. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look happy to him. 
No one's perfect. 
I think that Tom and Mary don't have children yet. 
I'm faster than you are. 
Tom has got a twisted sense of humour. 
I wish that I were someone else. 
I didn't know that you were scared. 
I cried when Tom told me he and Mary were getting divorced. 
I think that Tom won't be cooperative. 
Tom and Mary took off their shoes. 
I wasn't really planning on doing that. 
I don't think that Tom knows that Mary has to do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't mind buying that for you. 
Tom won't admit he was wrong. 
Sorry, but I can't do so. 
Tom and Mary said it wasn't as hard to do that as they expected. 
Tom told me he was psyched. 
We should have brought lunch. 
The leading brand of fizzy drinks in most countries is Coca-Cola. 
Tom didn't have to stay home to help us. We could have done it by ourselves. 
I think that Tom has already told us everything we need to know. 
I need to buy some new clothes for Tom. 
I think that going to Boston would be fun. 
Has anybody told Tom that he'll have to do that tomorrow? 
I think that Tom should do that himself. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't given Mary his phone number. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't want to go to Australia with Mary. 
You should tell Tom you aren't planning on swimming. 
Tom said that we needed at least $300 to buy everything we needed. 
I know Tom would do that by himself. 
I thought that you were right. 
I think that Tom will be discouraged. 
Tom said that Mary was working in Australia. 
My father isn't talkative. 
I know Tom won't be forgiven for doing that. 
I sure hope Tom gets here on time. 
Tom thought Mary was just pretending to be happy. 
Do you promise you won't tell Tom I gave you his phone number? 
I didn't know you did that by yourselves. 
I think Tom could have solved that problem by himself. 
Tom said that he'd likely do that. 
Tom told me that he was headed home. 
Tom thinks Mary won't be home on October 20th. 
I thought that everyone was hungry. 
Tom said that he would sort it out. 
I know Tom is a strange guy. 
We may need to go to Australia next month. 
I always knew Tom was destined for greatness. 
Did Tom happen to tell you how he plans on doing that? 
Tom thinks that Mary won't be the last one to do that. 
How dare you laugh at me? 
Tom and Mary say they'd like to win. 
I promise that I won't tell anyone where it is. 
Sports are good for your health. 
Tom said that Mary was motivated to do that. 
I don't think that it's likely that Tom will be here today. 
I thought you said that you wanted Tom to do that. 
I wonder if Tom will really do that today. 
I thought that Tom wouldn't be able to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that he might be able win. 
Tom said that he's glad that Mary was able to do that. 
Tom said he thought that he'd be able to fix Mary's car. 
Tom said that he's quit drinking. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was mean. 
Are you positive that Tom will do that? 
Tom said that he didn't have much time left. 
Tom and Mary wondered why everybody was staring at them. 
Both Tom and Mary know that that isn't likely to happen. 
Tom is going to stop Mary from doing that. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was probably not having any fun doing that. 
I should have talked to Tom first. 
I don't think that Tom knows how to play the cello. 
I think that Tom might leave for Boston early tomorrow morning. 
Tom says he's not planning to do that. 
Don't tell anyone where Tom is. 
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here. 
They promised they'd do that. 
I didn't know you could do that that well. 
I don't think Tom will be glad that's going to happen. 
I think that Tom could manage to do that alone. 
She's capable of anything. 
I thought you said that we weren't going to sing. 
There's a dog! 
I thought that you said that you could swim. 
I thought that you said you were motivated to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't need a break. 
Tom said that he shot Mary in self-defense. 
I wish you'd told me this earlier. 
Tom was surprised that Mary wasn't able to dance very well. 
They told everyone they were tired. 
Tom was surprised when Mary told him that she was only thirteen. 
I thought that you said that you'd rather do that alone. 
Tom thinks I need to sleep more. 
I thought you said that you didn't see Tom this morning. 
Tom said that he wasn't injured. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't happy. 
Tom phoned to say he isn't coming. 
He's just an amateur. 
We're giving Tom a birthday party. 
They said they think they can do that. 
I wonder whether or not I can do that again. 
I often feel depressed. 
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that. 
Tom said that he thought that he had to do that. 
I wonder whether or not Tom has done that already. 
You should have eaten some cake. 
Tom said that he doesn't think you need to do that. 
Tom and Mary think that they have the flu. 
Who told you that we needed to do that? 
Tom said that Mary has only done that once. 
I knew Tom wasn't a very nice guy. 
Tom knew he should have done that by himself. 
What's cooking in the kitchen? 
I am grateful for your help. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was interested in doing that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was odd. 
They are hiding. 
Tom realized he wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf. 
I don't think that Tom will do that with you. 
I'm tired of homework. 
I don't think that I'll dance with Tom. 
I think I should have asked for help. 
I didn't begin to study French until I was thirty years old. 
I think that Tom is unbeatable. 
It should have been easy to accomplish. 
Tom knew Mary told everyone she wasn't going to go to Boston. 
It's not necessary for you to be here any longer. 
No one seems to like Tom. 
Tom and Mary say that they can't believe anyone. 
No matter what Tom says, I plan on doing that. 
I am proud of you. 
It was clear Tom had intended to do that yesterday. 
I think that Tom wouldn't be in Australia now. 
I should have done that with Tom. 
I didn't think anyone was going to help you. 
Tom and Mary said they were homeless. 
The earth is a planet. 
I think that Tom would be skeptical. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was unbeatable. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be suspicious. 
I feel I could have done better. 
I thought that Tom was kind of cute. 
Tom said that he wasn't expecting any help from you. 
I thought you said that I have to do that. 
When is Tom planning on eating? 
We now know that isn't true. 
I don't think that Tom sees it that way. 
Unfortunately, Apple does not provide a warranty for accidental damages. 
I think Tom likes to do that. 
She is the laziest person I know. 
Both Tom and Mary haven't yet done that. 
Don't talk rubbish! 
Tom said that Mary wasn't scared. 
I should have helped you do that. 
Tom said he'd give a book to Mary. 
I think that Tom can sing country music better than anyone else I know. 
Tom and Mary both saw you. 
Tom thinks that Mary will be able to convince John to do that. 
I don't know whether Tom works there or not. 
There's no question about it. 
Nobody was able to solve the problem. 
I won't talk to him anymore. 
I think that Tom is going to do that, too. 
I shouldn't have allowed you to do that. 
I've already met everyone. 
Tom said that Mary would also do that. 
Tom said that he hasn't done anything wrong. 
Tom and Mary told me that they wouldn't wait. 
I'm not convinced I should do that. 
I think that you should accept Tom's resignation. 
I didn't know you were going to let Tom do that by himself. 
I know Tom may want to do that. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look like she was enjoying herself. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be asleep when he got home. 
Maybe Tom doesn't know I hardly ever do that anymore. 
It's a deadly poison. 
They know they're being watched. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary could speak French. 
Tom may be sleeping. 
I know Tom isn't a very good manager. 
I don't care if you do that or not. 
It isn't rocket science. 
Tom said that he wanted to help us. 
There's somebody waiting for you. 
They said that they were ready. 
Tom and Mary said that they felt lightheaded. 
You know that you shouldn't do that, don't you? 
Nothing's been done. 
Let's make sure that that doesn't happen. 
I know Tom knows why we couldn't do that for him. 
Tom said that he thought that could happen in Boston, too. 
I didn't know Tom was an anarchocommunist. 
I think that Tom would like to be the next one to do that. 
Tom said that I was the one with the problem. 
You're not expected to do that, are you? 
We'll climb the mountain if it's fine tomorrow. 
No one told Tom what he should do. 
Have you ever hit somebody? 
I don't think that Tom was mad. 
I knew Tom knew how to do that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were healthy. 
I think that's wrong. 
There's a place for everything. 
Tom said that he won't be allowed to do that anymore. 
I told Tom that you were hungry. 
Tom is pretty sure he saw a wolf. 
I don't think that it's up to you to decide. 
I thought that you were retired. 
Tom said that he hopes that Mary won't do that by herself. 
They said they had to work. 
My father won't be busy tomorrow. 
They told everyone they were cold. 
Didn't you know Tom isn't planning to do that? 
I was surprised when I heard Tom had committed suicide. 
I know that Tom is a few years younger than me. 
Tom told me he was strong. 
Tom and Mary say they can't wait that long. 
Tom thinks that he should help Mary. 
I wonder if Tom really told Mary she shouldn't do that. 
Tom won't let anyone but Mary drive his car. 
I don't think that Tom knows why I wanted to do that. 
No one else was there. 
Tom told Mary that he'd decided to stay for a few more days. 
I know Tom wasn't the first one to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't need to do that. 
I didn't think that you'd do that by yourself. 
I don't think that we have enough food to feed everyone. 
I know Tom isn't a bad person. 
It's said that he knows the secret. 
I think Tom would be a good roommate. 
Tom said Mary thought that he might be required to do that. 
I know Tom didn't know who had done that for him. 
Tom said that he was well. 
Why didn't you tell me you didn't want my help? 
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that today. 
I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong. 
I'm certain that I didn't say that. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels. 
I'm as happy as can be. 
If they'd known what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans. 
I know that Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that. 
Tom is rich, but he isn't as rich as Mary. 
Go wake Tom up and tell him breakfast is ready. 
Tom was surprised Mary was still up. 
I should have left early. 
Tom said that he knew Mary might not have to do that by herself. 
Tom said that his failure was due to bad luck. 
I didn't think that Tom would be alone. 
Tom said he isn't planning to buy anything. 
She's got to be taken to hospital. 
Things didn't go the way I'd hoped they would. 
Tom said he thought he wouldn't get there until after dark. 
Tom said Mary knew that he wanted to do that again. 
I know that Tom is careless. 
Let me know if there's anything I can do. 
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary he'd go to Australia with her. 
The bus was ten minutes late. 
Tom's not home right now. 
Tom said that he likes to ski, too. 
I don't think that there's any point in discussing this matter with you. 
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourselves. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might not want to do that until it gets cooler. 
I didn't think that Tom was annoyed. 
Tom said that he wasn't aware Mary had done that. 
Tom said that he's faster at doing that than Mary is. 
Tom and Mary told me that they felt hot. 
I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that by himself. 
We split up the loot among the three of us. 
I don't think that Tom could do that by himself. 
Tom told me that I was pretty. 
When does the performance begin? 
Tom knows that he has to help Mary tomorrow. 
Tom will unlikely go jogging with Mary. 
I don't think that Tom knows who did that to Mary. 
All three of my brothers are older than I am. 
Tom said that he didn't know if he'd be able to do that. 
I know Tom wasn't able to do that. 
Keep left at the next traffic light. 
I don't think it's worth the price that you paid for it. 
I think that Tom loves Mary. 
Tom does not need Mary's help. 
Tom and Mary say they're lonely. 
Were you afraid the first time that you were on an airplane? 
I'm sorry that I didn't keep my promise. 
I don't think that Tom is the one who needs to apologize. 
I'm disappointed in my son. 
I don't think that I did very well. 
Do you think that there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow? 
You know that I don't have a car. 
There's a large supermarket. 
I suspected that Tom was discouraged. 
I'm sure Tom won't force anybody to do that. 
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that. 
I would have done the same thing Tom did. 
Are you sure no one can see us? 
There is no solution to this problem. 
I heard that Tom was in trouble. 
I wonder whether Tom will be busy tomorrow. 
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything that he wanted. 
Has he contacted you? 
Tom and Mary said that they'd be doing that soon. 
Tom bought lots of souvenirs. 
Today's October twentieth. 
Tom and Mary said that they planned on going. 
I hope that Tom saw what Mary did. 
I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian. 
Africa isn't a country. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that. 
Tom knows that I didn't agree to do that. 
I have no kids. 
I know Tom forgot to do that. 
I know that you want to be happy. 
I think that that book isn't so interesting. 
I was told that that isn't a good idea. 
I don't think that Tom would be interested in doing that. 
I think that our team is going to continue to get better. 
I wish someone would help me with that. 
Tom definitely knows he shouldn't be doing that. 
Tom thinks that Mary and I can't take care of ourselves. 
I'm not sure that Tom will be there. 
It's a big responsibility. 
I think you should turn yourselves in. 
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was too old to do that. 
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom. 
I didn't know you and Tom worked together. 
No one will know that I'm here. 
I'm glad that I left Australia. 
Tom said that he thought I needed to get more exercise. 
Tom told me that he'd try to do that. 
Tom and Mary know that they shouldn't do that. 
Tom said Mary thought that he might be required to do that the next time he travels. 
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that. 
Tom said that he knew I might need to do that. 
Tom said he didn't think that Mary was sleeping. 
Tom and Mary said that they weren't coming back. 
Tom doesn't know Mary is in love with someone else. 
I don't think that Tom is concerned. 
I wish that I had had the chance to learn French in high school. 
It was clear Tom was supposed to help us do that. 
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that. 
I thought that Tom was still in jail. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might not have to do that by himself. 
Tom said that he probably wouldn't win. 
It's possible Tom may not know I'm here. 
Do you think that I'm weird? 
Tom thinks that he knows it all. 
Tom said that it's not going to end well. 
Tom and Mary said that they couldn't do that today. 
I thought that we had something to give to Tom. 
The students did the work themselves. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't mind doing that. 
You'll remain here until you're summoned. 
My daughter is being potty trained. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary could have done that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were feeling fine. 
They said they isn't ready to go. 
Something has happened to him. 
No one suspected anything like this. 
Tom was drunk and said things that he shouldn't have. 
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other. 
Tom and Mary told me that they've never met you. 
I think Tom is a pretty good painter. 
I know Tom is a picky eater and seldom tries anything new. 
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal. 
I suspect Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore. 
I know that Tom doesn't love me. 
I know Tom knows I know how to do that. 
Look at this high mountain! 
She's still nattering on. 
You are a nerd. 
Everybody was late but me. 
He couldn't resist the temptation. 
Tom will likely get mad if you do that. 
I assumed that Tom would agree to do that. 
I am a libertarian. 
Is it all right if I ask Tom to help me? 
I wonder whether or not Tom could help us. 
I don't think that I've ever met anybody like you. 
Tom said that he doesn't want to do that today. 
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone. 
She's curious to find out who sent the flowers. 
My hearing is not as good as it used to be. 
Tom said that he didn't want to live in Australia. 
Tom admitted he'd been rude. 
You'll have a rough time. 
I should have let Tom talk to you first. 
Tom is now either in Australia or New Zealand. 
I didn't think that we should be talking about that. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would let me do that. 
Didn't you know that you weren't supposed to be there? 
I know Tom is a little older than Mary is. 
Tom didn't know someone had been hired to kill him. 
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts. 
I don't think that Tom would enjoy doing that. 
Tom said that he thought I might not need to do that. 
Shut up and listen to me! 
Tom told me he thought that he might be able to do that. 
Tom said that he suspected that Mary was very eager to do that. 
Am I the only one who is confused? 
I know Tom is a bully. 
That boy is very smart. 
How's your dad? 
Tom said he thought that Mary wasn't sleeping. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was home. 
I hope Tom doesn't get jealous. 
I'm pretty sure that that wasn't what Tom meant. 
It won't be difficult for us to do that. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look tired to him. 
I doubt Tom would ever be allowed to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore. 
I think that Tom has a plan. 
It isn't what it seems. 
They said they felt comfortable. 
Tom said that he had never planned on living in Australia for so long. 
Tom told me that he didn't actually want to go to Boston. 
Tom has a lot more books than you. 
I know Tom is about the same height as you. 
There's no excuse for his delay. 
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag. 
Tom said he's glad that Mary wasn't hurt. 
Tom asked Mary whether she'd read the book he'd lent her. 
I woke up at seven. 
I could have done that, but I didn't. 
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anybody they're getting married. 
They said they planned on going Monday. 
It isn't going to be easy to find someone to rent this house. 
Do not speak so fast, please. 
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast. 
Tom didn't tell anybody they had to do that. 
I think that Tom paid way too much for that old saxophone. 
Tom said that he was all worn out. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was busy. 
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that. 
You should be ashamed of yourself. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was finished. 
I thought that you had to work. 
Tom said that he didn't have everything he needed. 
You should have stayed where you were. 
I am going to miss you. 
You never told me that you didn't like Australia. 
Tom and Mary said that they're trying to lose weight. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimistic. 
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't. 
Tom could have kicked himself. 
I don't think that Tom would help me with my homework. 
Tom has to be right. 
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you? 
Tom said that he didn't think that he could do that without our help. 
Tom thinks that Mary isn't awake. 
Did anybody else hug Tom? 
Tom told me that he liked my idea. 
I know that you're just doing that to annoy me. 
That is a mistake. 
One way isn't better than the other. 
What is wrong with me? 
Is anyone afraid? 
Tom thinks that he can do anything he sets his mind to. 
It's been seven years since we got married. 
I could have done that better than Tom did. 
I don't think that we're ready to do that yet. 
I thought that we were friends. 
Please don't be angry with me. 
I don't think that Tom could've done that any better. 
I know that Tom didn't do that correctly. 
She's in a bad mood. 
I didn't think that Tom would cry. 
Tom thinks that Mary is better at French than she really is. 
Tonight I'm available. 
Do you think Tom would have done that? 
That's his house. 
I'm at home. 
You don't need to pay for your lunch. 
Maybe I should have tried harder. 
I thought that Tom was going to do that today. 
They promised they'd check on it. 
I'm sure Tom would have agreed. 
Tom and Mary said they don't like doing that. 
Tom said he knew that he might have to do that by himself. 
I know that I'm in trouble now. 
It isn't the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters. 
Tom must have put up a fight. 
Tom says that he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia. 
I'm worried because I think there's a chance Tom might get hurt. 
Tom said he was glad that you'd done that. 
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker. 
Well, I never did! 
Tom thinks that Mary won't be able to win. 
I'm a student, but he isn't. 
Tom said that he thought he knew what Mary planned to do. 
I wonder if Tom is really homesick. 
Tom and Mary said that they can't sing very well. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was good at French. 
Tom says he'll always love Mary. 
I wish that I could speak French as fluently as you do. 
I wish that I were someone else. 
I thought that Tom had already done his homework. 
Tom's not busy. 
I just wanted you to know that I support you. 
Tom said that he knew the area well. 
We're all in grave danger. 
Why would anybody care what Tom thinks? 
I've just hard-boiled an egg for myself. 
Do you have a pen with you? 
I don't think that Tom will be in Australia next summer. 
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for three hundred dollars. 
They said they like this time of year. 
Tom wants Mary to know she can trust him. 
They say they declined that deal. 
I know that Tom didn't know you couldn't do that. 
I think that I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks. 
He told him he was adopted with his dying breath. 
I know Tom is a really close friend of Mary's. 
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that. 
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves. 
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that? 
I know Tom would unlikely agree to do that. 
Tom shut his computer down. 
I don't think that Tom knows what time it is. 
It's obvious that Tom can't do that without some help. 
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that. 
Tom could have asked me first. 
You aren't actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you? 
I didn't do that as soon as I should have. 
I don't think that Tom is bossy. 
Did you know that Tom had relatives in Australia? 
I don't think that Tom will give you the keys. 
I wonder whether Tom has ever asked Mary why she didn't do that. 
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me. 
Tom said that he wanted to change his plans. 
How do you tell somebody that? 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was hungry. 
I thought that Tom already knew that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary had done that. 
Tom and Mary swore they'd never hit me again. 
Tom said that he should've stayed in Australia longer. 
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school. 
I know that I can do this. 
I don't think that I should've left before Tom. 
Tom said that he wouldn't help Mary anymore. 
That guy over there reminds me of somebody I used to know. 
Tell them that I'll come. 
His face turned pale. 
I thought that I heard something. 
I've already told Tom that I need to do that. 
I plan on staying at home all day Monday. 
I'd rather do this by myself. 
Tom is the only person who could've stolen Mary's necklace. 
I don't think that we're ready. 
Nobody contradicted Tom. 
Are you sure that you want to go to Australia with Tom? 
Do you really think that Tom is amused by what's going on? 
We haven't yet begun to fight. 
Who's knocking on the door? 
I think that Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that. 
They said they're supportive. 
I thought would be a great idea. 
What you said shocked everybody. 
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous. 
Tom said that he thought what Mary did was a mistake. 
I hope that no one comes. 
I thought that everybody could do that. 
I think that we'll be back soon. 
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom studying. 
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anybody. 
Everything's going to be okay. 
Tom told me it didn't matter. 
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that. 
I am 12 years old. 
I had forgotten about that. 
Tom told everyone he was through doing that. 
They figured that there was no hope. 
Tom said that Mary didn't want to do that again. 
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased. 
I thought you said that you were glad you didn't do that. 
Tom can speak a little French. 
I know that Tom is a lot taller than I am. 
I thought that that's what you wanted. 
I can't guarantee that's going to happen. 
I knew Tom wasn't very busy. 
I don't think that I've ever seen Tom with Mary. 
I know that Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary. 
Tom said he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again. 
You aren't worried about the test, are you? 
Tom said that he was willing to help me do that. 
I told you I don't know whether Tom will tell the truth or not. 
Everybody is having a good time. 
Tom said that he didn't do what Mary said he did. 
Tom and Mary both wanted to do that. 
You shouldn't use somebody else's toothbrush. 
Tom thinks that he loves Mary more than John loves Alice. 
I wonder whether Tom will be able to do that. 
Tom thought that it was difficult. 
We've walked all around the lake. 
I don't think it's going to be hard to convince Tom. 
They said they didn't work on Mondays. 
I don't think that Tom is as rich as most people think he is. 
You'll do no such thing. 
You're so hot. 
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year. 
They said they were very mad. 
I know Tom knows that I want to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom is safe or not. 
I know Tom didn't know that he shouldn't be doing that here. 
Does Tom know that you want to buy a new computer? 
I haven't yet done that. 
Tom said that he felt like doing that. 
I don't understand how this could've happened. 
You're as tall as my sister. 
Tom has read many books about that. 
I think that Tom has already done enough. 
Do you know anyone in Boston? 
Tom said that he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do. 
Somebody told Tom the truth. 
I thought that you'd be happy to see me. 
Tom admitted he was the one who had stolen Mary's money. 
Tom and Mary were told that they had to do that. 
We'd better tell the others. 
Why is everybody talking about Tom? 
Federer had a love hold at 2-2. 
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to do. 
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself. 
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together. 
The fact that I said nothing made him angry. 
When'll he be finished? 
You're a very naughty boy 
Tom plans to do that in the near future. 
We're late. 
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you? 
A plate of pulao with some kebabs is heaven on earth. 
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that. 
Tom said that he was wondering whether Mary could do that or not. 
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have electronic mail. 
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
Tom said he hopes that you won't want to do that. 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't been there. 
I thought that you said that you wanted to go with us. 
I know that you aren't happy. 
Tom and Mary said that they're not in any hurry. 
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks. 
I hadn't planned on doing that, but I can if you really want me to. 
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that. 
Tom said that he expected Mary to participate. 
I swim every day. 
Who's the lucky guy? 
They pretended they didn't know me. 
I know Tom is a bit shorter than Mary. 
Tom will do that if nobody stops him. 
I'm sure that Tom will refuse to do that. 
I'm sure you'll succeed. 
You know that Tom and I aren't going to do that, don't you? 
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing that by 2:30. 
I'm sure we should have turned left back there. 
Everyone knows that Tom speaks good Gaulish. 
I thought maybe you wouldn't be able to do that. 
Tom said that he thought he had forgotten something. 
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics. 
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway. 
Tom really has a lot on his plate at the moment. 
I knew Tom knew who needed to do that. 
I don't think that you should drive. 
Let's hope that that changes today. 
It isn't fair at all. 
That's not exactly what I said. 
They put down their books. 
I know that Tom is a better driver than me. 
I thought that you loved Tom. 
That's not feasible with current technology. 
They said they tries to be optimistic. 
Tom said everybody in his office speaks French. 
I wonder whether or not Tom has already told Mary not to do that. 
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone. 
Tom and Mary said that they're sick. 
Tom said that he isn't allowed to do that. 
I assume that you're going somewhere with this. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was thirty. 
You have a sense of humor. I like that. 
Tom said that he thought that he should learn how to do that. 
It's not something that I want to discuss. 
I think Tom will refuse to do that. 
Tom and Mary said they needed my help. 
I think she is over forty years old. 
Can you cook an omelet? 
Tom said that he knew that I was coming. 
Nobody asked you to come here. 
I wonder whether Tom really kissed Mary last night. 
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring. 
You know that I won't say anything. 
I'll do it tomorrow. 
I can't walk anymore. 
I wonder if we could do anything to help. 
Tom said that he'd be willing to help us do that. 
I don't think that Tom is capable of that. 
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself. 
Tom is dating a girl who's three years younger than him. 
I think that Tom wouldn't refuse to do that. 
Tom said that he wasn't interested in sports. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
I know Tom would be interested in doing that. 
I think that Tom will like this wine. 
I think we spoke on the phone. 
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that. 
There is a kernel of truth in what he's saying. 
Tom said that he wanted to write a book. 
I don't think Tom is a slob. 
He's not a virtuoso. 
I suspect that Tom lied to me. 
Tom will eventually need to do that. 
Tom told me that he'd call at 2:30. 
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet. 
I know Tom is a good diver. 
It's not easy for me to trust anyone. 
I knew I should have stayed home. 
I don't think that this is enough food to feed all of us. 
He is not the sharpest tool in the shed. 
Tom said that he plans to be a doctor. 
I'm disappointed my friends aren't here. 
A wolf can't be tamed. 
I think that Tom might be older than me. 
I don't think that that's correct. 
I'm not going to do anything about it. 
Tom says he's done nothing wrong. 
Tom didn't know what he should have been doing. 
Tom said that I should study harder. 
They say they'll hurt me. 
I know that Tom might be tempted to do that. 
I'm not sure that I can win this. 
I'm afraid that you won't get paid. 
Are you worried that might happen? 
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that. 
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here. 
I'll see to it that gets done. 
I wear a suit, but not a tie. 
I'm as tired as you are. 
Tom thought that he might be coming down with a cold. 
I think that Tom hates waiting for me. 
I should have apologized right away. 
You're lucky that you didn't get injured. 
Where do Tom and Mary plan on living? 
This tree is more than a hundred years old. 
Tom didn't want anybody to get angry. 
I don't think that was the right thing to do. 
Are you certain that Tom will do that? 
We can't live without air. 
I didn't know Tom hated Mary. 
Tom says that Mary has always lived in Australia. 
Tom told me that he wasn't nervous. 
Tom knows something that we don't. 
Tom said that he was worried about Mary. 
We all got in the car. 
I wonder whether or not Tom likes doing that. 
Last night I lost my cookies. 
Tom is pretty good at bowling. 
Tom said that Mary gave him something. 
Give me some water! 
Tom said that he wants to write a book. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be mad. 
I don't think that you've been paying attention. 
We'll need more time. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary is doing. 
Tom said that Mary is going to do that tomorrow. 
You're both welcome to come with us. 
I can't believe Tom is actually doing that. 
It isn't something that anyone can do. 
Tom said that he ate too much. 
We're all looking forward to your coming. 
I think that Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon. 
Have I ever told you guys about the first time that I met Tom? 
I began studying French when I was thirteen. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary. 
I know Tom will likely give you permission to do that. 
Is it all right if I ask Tom to help me? 
Tom said that Mary knew that John might not have to do that by himself. 
I wonder whether Tom is motivated. 
Tom said he would have done that if he'd thought it was necessary. 
Tom didn't know that you were supposed to do that. 
I think that Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that. 
I still wish that you'd do that. 
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning on staying very long. 
I didn't know that you were going to be jealous. 
Tom didn't know Mary had children. 
They say they can't wait that long. 
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that. 
Tom may be lonely. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't very busy. 
I'm absolutely certain that isn't going to happen. 
I think that he is right. 
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary. 
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that. 
Tom doesn't have any idea where Mary is planning to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they have to find somebody to help them do that. 
You are very annoying. 
I've already finished reading this book. 
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher. 
I didn't know that you were rich. 
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston. 
You've finished your homework, haven't you? 
What could have happened? 
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not. 
I lost my way in the woods. 
I know Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band. 
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Monday. 
Keep your mouth shut. 
Tom said that he knew he might need to do that on Monday.

Tom didn't give me everything that he promised. 
You knew Tom told everyone he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?

It's lashing.

I should have gone there by myself. 
Go back home!

I'm traveling alone.

It won't be possible to do that. 
I know Tom is afraid that he might hurt Mary's feelings.

I doubt Tom will be able to seal the deal. 
I thought that you'd be through doing that by 2:30. 
If you'd helped me, I would have succeeded. 
I know Tom is courageous. 
Can somebody give us a lift? 
They didn't think they would make it. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that you can do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they're glad they could do that. 
What makes you think that Tom and Mary are planning to resign? 
Tom said that Mary was good at speaking French. 
Tom's parents allow him to do what he wants to do.

I flood myself with light of the immense. 
I know that you're going to come back. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was broke. 
I wish that I could have helped you more. 
I knew Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to. 
I know Tom isn't a very creative person. 
I also plan on doing that. 
Tom told everyone he was afraid. 
The police said that we had to leave. 
Tom said that I should've left early.

Close your books.

Do you often eat out? 
I can't believe you didn't recognize me. 
I think you're going to enjoy yourselves tonight. 
It doesn't mean anything.

They told me they were pessimistic. 
I don't understand how I could have made such a mistake. 
My brother's in Australia now. 
I can no longer stand this noise. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again. 
I don't think that that was what Tom said.

I am going to work.

What is it for?

Tom said that he knew that Mary couldn't win. 
I thought you said that you didn't know anybody in Boston. 
This house isn't for sale.

Stay out of it.

I don't think that I'll go to Boston this year. 
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.

I'm afraid that I'm a bit out of shape. 
They deny they paid ransom money. 
I want you to find out if Tom is planning on coming here by himself. 
I hope that I'll be able to help you at some other time. 
They said they figured I could do that. 
We both know that that isn't true. 
Tom wasn't surprised Mary was still up. 
They say they might go shopping.

I know that Tom will probably have to do that. 
I don't think that you'll have the time to do that today. 
That sometimes happens. 
I thought that we could get together later. 
I know Tom isn't the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that. 
I think that I have a good chance of winning the election. 
Who's coming? 
Tom must have practiced that a lot.

They said they isn't sure. 
Tom said that he didn't believe Mary really planned to go with us. 
Tom said that he was very happy. 
Tom said that he'd complain. 
I think there's still a chance that'll happen. 
I thought that doing that would be a waste of time. 
I'm fairly certain that isn't going to happen. 
I thought that you were used to living in a trailer. 
I didn't think Tom would tell anybody. 
They said they'll buy that for you. 
I knew that we should've stayed in Australia. 
They said they intended to do that. 
I wonder whether or not Tom ever gives Mary flowers. 
I hope Tom wasn't injured in the crash. 
No, it isn't easy. 
I know Tom is tall. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was here. 
I don't think that Tom did anything with it. 
I assume that that was a rhetorical question. 
Tom leaped out of bed. 
What's the best way to contact you? 
What color is this cat? 
It isn't a cat. It's a dog.

Tell Tom that you lied. 
I've been a teacher for 15 years.

I don't think that it's right. 
I don't have to do anything I don't want to do. 
Tom and Mary weren't planning on doing that until John asked them to. 
If you'd left home a little earlier you would have been on time. 
You can't be too careful when driving. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might want to do that this evening. 
Tell Tom that I'm coming. 
I would have bought more clothes if I had had the money. 
I thought that I told you not to talk to my daughter. 
Tom and Mary told me they've just done that. 
What're the chances that Tom will win? 
I'm afraid that you can't. 
I think that Tom won't be gone by the time we get there. 
Tom said that he plans on staying in Boston. 
I don't think that you have a choice. 
She likes running. 
They said they'd leave. 
Tom said that he needed to do that before Mary got here. 
That's not what I am going to talk about. 
Tom and John both say they've kissed Mary. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was ready. 
I know that I've been lied to. 
Tom is the one who's going to be punished. 
It's a pity that you can't join us. 
I know that I'm supposed to do this. 
I can't believe you did this! 
Tom said that he wanted to help. 
Why does everyone think Tom and I are stupid? 
What are the positive aspects? 
The battery indicator light is showing that the battery isn't getting charged. 
I thought that you looked sad. 
Tom said that he doesn't plan to go. 
You know I'm supposed to be doing that today, don't you?

I don't think that people should do that. 
I think that this is a serious matter. 
Tom said he doesn't think that Mary really needs to do that. 
Tom taught his friends French. 
I thought that Tom might not be permitted to do that today. 
Mr. Yoshida knows French History very well. 
I should have never left early. 
Are you tired out? 
I left as soon as I was asked to. 
I don't have anything to do. 
I thought that Tom might know where Mary put the key. 
I don't think that I'm being unreasonable. 
Tom and Mary said everyone they know has been to Boston. 
They told us that they could speak French. 
You're deceiving yourself. 
We talked to everybody. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still troubled by what happened. 
I assume that you'll not come to work tomorrow. 
It's become very difficult for me to walk very far. 
It isn't deep enough. 
Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui and Tibetan people (as well as other minority groups in China) are as dear to each other as members of one family.

I don't think that Tom knows a lot about alligators. 
The house isn't occupied now. 
We aren't quite sure exactly where Tom lives. 
Do you really think anybody will vote for you? 
I would have never thought of that. 
I think that Tom is unbiased. 
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't been there. 
I already knew Tom was planning on doing that. 
Stop treating me like a child. 
Tom said he thought that I seemed impressed. 
You didn't know you wouldn't be able to do that, did you? 
Tom is interested. 
I'm sure that Tom will do that. 
I know Tom is in his bedroom sound asleep. 
I know Tom knows that I hardly ever do that. 
I think that Tom will be furious. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be required to do that by himself.

Tom said that he'd rather not eat now. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that you can win.

I didn't realize Tom wanted Mary to do that. 
I don't think that I'm going to be able to do that. 
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to work together. 
I wish I could have done it by myself. 
I need a little help! 
I have serious doubts about their plan succeeding. 
You could have saved me a trip if you'd just told me I didn't need to be here today. 
They said they're curious. 
Tom could lend Mary money. 
We know that that's never going to happen. 
I am about to cry! 
Tom and Mary say that they have no concrete plans.

Did you know Tom is an extremely gifted artist? 
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he needed to do that. 
Both Tom and Mary have decided not to resign. 
I knew that Tom was no good.

Tom baked his teacher some cookies. 
It was clear Tom was determined to do that. 
I think that Tom and John look better without beards. 
Tom must have been a lot like you.

I know Tom is a physical therapist. 
Tom is just over thirty. 
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that? 
Tom figures he isn't alone. 
I don't think that I know the boy who's sitting over there. 
Tom knows better than to walk home by himself after dark. 
I thought that we could talk about anything. 
Tom won't likely want to do that. 
That would be great. 
I know that isn't enough. 
It isn't always possible to eat well when you're traveling in this part of the world. 
Tom would've allowed you to do that. 
Tom said that he wasn't being paid enough. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was confused.

Tom and Mary said that they just needed more time. 
Tom does what he wants to. 
Tom doesn't know I'm not Canadian. 
Tell me how you plan on doing that. 
It isn't how much you know, but what you can do that counts. 
This book's new. 
I thought that I'd be able to get home by 2:30. 
I know Tom is a very practical person. 
I didn't think that Tom would allow me to do that. 
Tom said that he's glad he got there early.

I didn't know that I didn't have enough money. 
Tom told me he enjoyed the drive. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was insane. 
I don't think that Tom knows that Mary is unhappy. 
Scream and cry as much as you want. Nobody will hear you. 
Tom assumed everyone at school knew that he'd been arrested. 
We'll attack at sunrise. 
I don't think that Tom knows all the rules yet. 
I know Tom is a better person than I'll ever be. 
I think Tom might've joined a cult. 
I'm invited to this party. 
It was clear Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she didn't need to do that. 
It is not important what my name is. 
Tom thought that Mary taught French. 
I don't think Tom knows I'm not single anymore. 
Is it okay if I sit here? 
Nothing's as important as peace. 
I thought we'd get there on time, but we didn't. 
Tom assumed that everyone knew Mary was going to do that. 
What're you going to do with that? 
I thought you said that you wanted to do that this morning. 
I thought that I'd be doing that by myself. 
I realized Tom wasn't joking. 
There's no chance Tom will forget to do that. 
Tom didn't think Mary was the one that did that. 
Prepare to die! 
Tom said that he was very tired. 
Tom seemed to be unaware that Mary hadn't done that yet. 
It has been done before. 
I don't think that we're going to be able to be at your party tonight. 
Tom and Mary said that they were ready to help. 
Mary said she's planning to go, too.

We did it. 
I didn't think that anyone had ever done that kind of a thing before. 
I'm sure that Tom will go to Australia. 
Are Tom and Mary planning on doing that anytime soon? 
I'm glad that I didn't buy one of those. 
I thought that you ought to know. 
Tom said that Mary has been trying to do that all day. 
It's a secret, so please don't tell anybody. 
Even if it rains, I plan on doing that. 
Do you think Tom would have helped us? 
Tom said that he wanted to buy another car. 
Tom has been doing that for more than thirty years. 
Tom told Mary he wanted to leave early. 
Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun. 
You know that Tom is in the hospital, don't you? 
I think that Tom is back from Boston. 
It has been decided. 
I thought that you read my resume. 
It's getting dark.

Tom called and said he was coming. 
Tom said he's glad that Mary didn't get hurt. 
I thought that you said that you couldn't draw. 
I wonder whether or not Tom wanted to go to Boston with Mary. 
It must've been difficult for Tom to do that. 
Mary has everything that she needs, with one exception: Tom. She misses him very much. 
Tom said he thought that I should get more exercise. 
That's not the way I would have done that. 
I didn't know Tom would be there. 
I thought that the ending was perfect. 
I wonder if Tom really wanted to go to Boston with Mary. 
I can't really be sure Tom wasn't the one who stole the money. 
It's what Tom would have wanted. 
I know Tom isn't much taller than Mary is. 
Tom has already decided he's not going to try to escape. 
I know that you and Tom skipped school yesterday. 
Nobody said doing that would be easy. 
Tom said he doesn't think that Mary does that. 
You said that you'd help me. 
Mary says she doesn't plan to go there by herself. 
I only hope it isn't too late. 
I don't think that Tom is going to win. 
Aren't Tom and Mary both from Australia? 
Thank you for sharing. 
I thought that you already knew about what happened. 
I wonder whether or not Tom will ask for my help.

Would it be all right if I went swimming?

It isn't going to work out. 
I'm afraid that I need to ask you a few questions. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might not be allowed to do that.

I don't think that it'll be hard to do that. 
It isn't something I'm proud of. 
Are Tom and Mary both still sick? 
I can't believe you did that! 
I knew Tom wasn't yet finished doing that. 
I don't think that it's worth the price that you paid for it. 
I think that Tom should go home. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary would be alone. 
I promise I won't hit anybody. 
Tom said that he'd try doing that today. 
Tom and Mary both used to live on Park Street. 
I know Tom knows that Mary ought to do that. 
Tom said that he felt much happier now. 
Tom said that he doesn't even want to think about it. 
The joke is on you. 
I'm determined to give up smoking. 
I thought that maybe I'd better not go home right away. 
Tom told me that he liked snow. 
Tom and Mary never should have done that together. 
Not every man can be happy. 
I promise that I won't do that. 
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that. 
I swear I'll tell you everything someday. 
Forty-four US Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers, and true to our founding documents. 
Tom didn't know Mary had gone to Boston. 
I was the only one there who knew Tom wanted to do that. 
Tom says he intends to win. 
I know Tom seldom does that anymore. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are still alone. 
I don't think that I would enjoy doing that outside in the winter. 
The rumor quickly spread. 
There's no way you're going out dressed like that. 
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we'll all die. 
You're embarrassing. 
I don't think that Tom knows why Mary has to do that tomorrow. 
It isn't that weird, is it? 
I didn't know that I was violating any laws. 
Do you promise me that you'll do that? 
You should tell Tom he isn't likely to win. 
They say they're willing to help. 
There's a possibility it's real. 
I know that I did the right thing. 
Tom says he despises Mary. 
I suspect that Tom is in there. 
I knew Tom was a pretty good jazz saxophone player. That's why I wanted him to join our band. 
I think that Tom is trying to trick us. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't forgotten to buy a birthday present for Mary. 
Tom probably can't do that any faster that than Mary. 
Tom and Mary have both put on some weight since the last time I saw them. 
Are you planning on telling Tom and Mary why you wanted them to do that? 
If Tom could have spoken French, he'd have had more fun. 
I don't think that Tom was excited. 
I suspect that Tom is likely to do that tomorrow. 
I think that Tom is still depressed. 
Tom said that he never agreed to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows Mary is in the hospital. 
I must have overlooked something. 
Tom plans on leaving Boston next year. 
What is Tom's problem? 
I know Tom would be happy doing that. 
Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to help John do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was healthy. 
It's not you, it's me. 
I thought that you were going to stay with Tom. 
I don't think that Tom is involved. 
Tom said that he doesn't plan to do that by himself. 
Tom said Mary thought that he might want to do that this evening. 
I thought that Tom had already been compensated for that. 
I promise you I'll be there to help you. 
Tom said that he thought I didn't look like I was enjoying myself. 
There's no reason that Tom wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he'd try. 
Tom said that he was planning to stay in Australia next summer. 
There's a chance Tom was wrong. 
I am fat. 
I think that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary not to do that anymore. 
Tom told me he needed space. 
Let's go to the beach! 
Tom seems to have lots of friends. 
Tom may not have enough money to buy what he needs. 
Tom said he isn't sure Mary can do that. 
Tom really should have eaten more for breakfast. 
Tom and Mary told me they were terrified. 
Tom told Mary he was happy. 
Tom said that he was tired of waiting. 
Why do you suspect Tom was the one who did that? 
Tom said that he's been having fun hanging out with us. 
The earthquake destroyed everything. 
I knew we should have brought more food with us. 
They put on their bathing suits. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary has to do that today. 
I'm sorry I've made you so unhappy. 
I don't think that Tom has much experience doing that. 
Tom said that he didn't mind eating after the children ate. 
In France the first name comes before the last name. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that. 
I'm pretty sure Tom and Mary have both passed away. 
I know Tom knew he shouldn't have done that. 
They know they're in real trouble now. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary could do that. 
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that by yourselves. 
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary shouldn't be doing that. 
I know Tom is a selfish person. 
Mary says she isn't planning to go. 
Do you plan on doing that? 
I'm sorry that Tom had to leave so early. 
I'd hoped that you'd tell me everything yourself. 
There's nothing to apologize for. 
I would rather go swimming. 
I've been planning to do that for months. 
I'm sorry that I was so slow. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't eat meat anymore. 
I'm surprised that Tom won. 
It is possible. 
Tom said that he needed to take a nap. 
I promised Tom that I'd wait. 
Tom said that he hopes that Mary will help him. 
Tom told me that he believed Mary. 
Tom hasn't yet quit. 
Tom said he didn't think that Mary would be able to do that. 
Tom knew there was a possibility Mary would do that. 
Please come in! 
I don't think that that'll happen anymore. 
Tom said Mary thought that he was the only one who knew how to do that. 
Tom wasn't able find what he was looking for. 
I didn't know that you were going to be nervous. 
I know you don't like me, but we have to work together. 
I know you ought to do that. 
I was surprised that Tom didn't come yesterday. 
A true friend would have helped. 
I know that Tom will love it. 
Tom told me he thought I should lose some weight. 
Tom said that he'd rather do that next week. 
I think that Tom is prejudiced. 
I thought that it was a mistake to tell Tom where we buried the treasure. 
I haven't yet called back. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look much older than John. 
Tom is probably a bit younger than me. 
You're out of danger. 
It's not worth repairing this camera. 
I know that isn't the truth. 
They promised they'd do that this week. 
I don't think that I have ever been this hungry before. 
I knew Tom would help Mary do that. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't accept our offer. 
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to help us today. 
Tom knew that what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was glad that was going to happen. 
I don't think that I have any chance of winning. 
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert. 
Tom said Mary thought that John might want to do that this evening. 
Tom and Mary said they were very sad. 
I figure my vote won't change anything. 
Tom's back on the junk. 
What makes you think that it was Tom who did this? 
Both of us agreed with Tom. 
I know Tom won't have to do that by himself. 
I know Tom isn't a very reasonable man. 
They promised they'd be here on Monday. 
I thought that it would be difficult for her to get the tickets. 
Tom said he'd do that, too. 
I thought Tom was a computer programmer. 
Tom said that he'd help me figure out how to do that. 
I know Tom is a better singer than Mary is. 
Tom is Mary's dad. 
I don't think that Tom will do that. 
Tom denied that he knew anything about the bank robbery. 
Everybody knows that I hate you. 
Next Monday, she'll have been in the hospital for a month. 
Tom said that he saw Mary spanking one of her children. 
That's something that I should've done a long time ago. 
I didn't know Tom had only one leg. 
Hello again! 
The show's Wednesday. 
I'm currently at home. 
I soon found out I wasn't talented enough. 
I don't think that anyone suspected you weren't really Tom. 
Go away and leave me alone. 
You should tell Tom that Mary is planning on doing that. 
It isn't always easy to tell the difference between good and bad. 
Tom is even lazier than Mary is. 
That's not funny! 
I don't think that anyone could've stopped Tom. 
Tom didn't think that he had a chance to succeed, but he at least wanted to give it a shot. 
I suspect that Tom has already left for Australia. 
They told me they had been sick. 
I know that I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did. 
I don't think that I can do that tonight. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was next. 
Tom and Mary put their spoons down. 
What will the neighbours think? 
Tom said he hopes that you try your best to win. 
How did you know that I needed to do that? 
Tom has asked me not to do that already. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't told Mary that he'd do that. 
Tom said that he wouldn't do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was in her room listening to music. 
I don't think that that's realistic. 
I don't think that that's right. 
They told me they're through doing that. 
Tom should've known this. 
I know Tom doesn't know that I don't want to do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary could play the saxophone. 
I don't think that I can love two people at the same time. 
Tom said that he thought that I was creative. 
There's a serious problem. 
I wonder whether I should do that or not. 
I don't think that that's going to happen today. 
I don't think that there's any reason that Tom has to do that. 
Tom is good at his job. 
Tom said that Mary often does that. 
Rape survivors are more likely to develop PTSD than survivors of other traumatic experiences. 
I thought that Tom would be the next one to do that. 
Nobody remembered today was my birthday. 
I know that Tom saved Mary's life. 
I think Tom is alone in his room. 
I know Tom didn't really need to do that. 
Tom wasn't the one who gave that to Mary. 
Tom told me I'm slow. 
Last week, I didn't do that as much as I usually do. 
Tom told me that he was over thirty. 
Tom and Mary showed me the letter that they received from John. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would need to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would want to do that. 
Tom was the one who told me that you shouldn't do that. 
I didn't think that anyone would dispute that. 
I know Tom is a much better singer than me. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was likely to cry. 
Tom thinks he's the only person in town who can play the bagpipes. 
Didn't you know Tom and Mary often eat together? 
Tom told me he thought Mary was out. 
They said that they were exhausted. 
Tom has written many books. 
Both Tom and Mary want to eat steak for dinner. 
I know that you probably want some help. 
I'm sorry that I made you worry. 
Tom said that he was planning on going to Australia next summer. 
I wonder what Tom is planning on buying. 
I don't think that Tom knows I hate him. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was deaf. 
I think Tom has never done that. 
Send him to me. 
Tom said that he didn't plan to go this week. 
Do you do the same with your children? 
Tom said that he's starved. 
Tom and Mary say they're not able to do that. 
He has to see a specialist. 
I knew that that would happen. 
I know that Tom is in Australia now. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary knows how to do that very well. 
I didn't think that Tom would be worried about something like that. 
Is this the first time that you've ever given blood? 
Have you had your tea? 
Tom wasn't able to find Mary a good job. 
My bike's got a flat tyre. 
I know that Tom was shaken. 
Goodnight! 
It's all going to be okay. 
Tom is convinced everyone hates him. 
I know Tom will do that for you. 
When did you last visit Boston? 
They say they didn't have to do that. 
I know that I'm rambling. 
I thought you said that it was getting fixed. 
She respects you. 
Tom and Mary told me they were miserable. 
They told me they'd call you later. 
I know that Tom knew Mary knew how to do that. 
Tom said that Mary went to Australia. 
Why's there no food in the refrigerator? 
Tom told me that he liked it. 
I know Tom knows who did that to Mary. 
I've read a book. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was confused. 
You ought to let Tom know you can't do that. 
I thought that Tom would be safe here. 
Tom thought that Mary might not be permitted to do that anymore. 
Nobody answered my questions. 
Tom told me that he wasn't planning to do that. 
I think Tom could have gotten home by himself. 
You should've seen me. 
Lot was a prophet of God. 
Doing that won't be as difficult you think. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are still homesick. 
I'm surprised that Tom remembers me. 
If you had asked for my advice, I would have advised you not to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't want to hang out with Mary anymore. 
Tom thought that Mary might not have to do that anymore. 
I wasn't aware that Tom should do that. 
They are surprised. 
I like foreign languages. 
What have you been watching? 
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom said he thought that it would be better not to go outside. 
It might not be as difficult to do as you think it'll be. 
We are in the same time zone. 
I thought that you knew both Tom and Mary were allergic to peanuts. 
They knew they wouldn't win. 
Tom and Mary said they agreed to do that. 
It's a beautiful day. 
You're more than welcome to come over. 
They said they'd do that later. 
He can also speak Russian. 
Tom said he wanted that, so I gave it to him. 
I'm afraid that I have some bad news for you. 
I knew Tom wouldn't eat the stew that Mary made for him. 
Tom said he thought that I was lazy. 
I wonder whether Tom wants to dance or not. 
Tom has to be reluctant to do that. 
Tom's speech wasn't as boring as Mary's speech was. 
Tom died without telling his secret to anyone. 
Tom knows that Mary is angry. 
They know they need to do that soon. 
Call me anything you want, just not late for dinner. 
We didn't see a single game. 
Tom said that he'd rather not spend much time doing that. 
I think that Tom stays at his grandparents' house whenever he visits Boston. 
I don't think that Tom wants to do that anymore. 
I know Tom has tried to do that. 
I don't think that Tom will want to go to Boston with you. 
I think that Tom is careless. 
I think that Tom ought to wait until at least 2:30 before he leaves. 
I thought that Tom would be present at today's meeting. 
Tom said Mary knew that he might be required to do that. 
That would have been the smart thing to do. 
I think that Tom will listen to me. 
I could've sworn something moved. 
Tom said he thought that it might happen in Boston, too. 
I didn't think anyone could've stopped Tom. 
I want to know whether Tom and Mary need to do that, too. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are exhausted. 
The world isn't as scary as you think it is. 
I think that Tom is deranged. 
I know that you don't want to do that, but you need to. 
Let's hope that that's enough time. 
Tom is one of the ugliest people I know. 
I am very glad to see you. 
I didn't think that anyone suspected you weren't Tom. 
Put your socks on quickly. We're late. 
Tom told everybody that he was starved. 
Tom told me that he knew how to speak French. 
I'm absolutely certain Tom is wrong. 
I thought that I'd give it another try. 
I thought that it was strange that Tom wasn't at Mary's party. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was unbiased. 
I don't think that you should've left early. 
Tom said that Mary wouldn't likely be able to do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore. 
I had no idea that you knew Tom. 
We'll discuss this problem later. 
I don't think that Tom has anybody to help him. 
How's it going? 
Tom thinks he can do whatever he wants to. 
I know I can't do that as well as Tom can. 
I know Tom is planning on doing that tomorrow. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be interested. 
It isn't especially hot today. 
I wasn't as successful as Tom was. 
Tom said that he didn't think that he could do that kind of thing. 
If you don't go, I won't go either. 
What're your plans? 
Tom and Mary say that they're not ready to go. 
I know Tom doesn't know I shouldn't do that. 
Tom thought Mary didn't like him. 
Tom said he didn't do anything illegal. 
Tom said he did that already. 
I think that you're going to be OK. 
I knew Tom was still willing to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he was glad that had happened. 
The computer stopped working. 
We know you aren't stupid. 
She did not turn up after all. 
We both know that that's a lie. 
Tom knows that we aren't supposed to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom would be awake at this time of night. 
I didn't think that Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that. 
I don't think that Tom is in Australia now. 
I don't think that Tom knows exactly what he should be doing. 
Tom and Mary can both do that. 
I thought that you might know. 
Tom is flaky. 
It's not always easy to face reality. 
Tom says he won't win. 
Tom was aware they were watching him. 
What the heck was that supposed to mean? 
I know that I'm in big trouble now. 
Why don't you ever do what I tell you? 
Tom decided that the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia. 
Tom never would've done that if Mary had asked him not to. 
I thought you said that you weren't interested. 
It was more difficult to do that than Tom said it would be. 
I don't think that Tom will be going to Australia with Mary. 
I'm so tired! 
I am 18 years old. 
They are not coming. 
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet. 
Let's hope you're cured. 
I know someone ought to do that. 
I can't speak French as well as you can. 
You should have listened to Tom more carefully. 
Tom said that I should let you drive. 
What's your favourite fast-food restaurant? 
Why's Tom wearing that hat? 
Tom said that he didn't want to wear John's old clothes. 
I don't think that we could do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary wants to do that. 
The clock stopped. 
Both Tom and I grew up in Boston. 
Tom said that he was an artist. 
I don't think that Tom will be back soon. 
I didn't think that we had enough money. 
You should have heard me. I shouted as loud as I could. 
I'm giving you what you want. 
I knew Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him. 
I know Tom is a good writer. 
They said they'd never want to do that. 
They said they'd eat fruit. 
Tom said that he didn't have to do that now. 
I thought that you wouldn't like Boston. 
I think there's a good chance that it'll rain tonight. 
I love you and I'll always love you. 
Nope. 
I know Tom isn't a very good hitter. 
I don't think that I'm the best person for the job. 
They say they'd be willing to help us. 
It isn't open for debate. 
Tom told everybody he was unemployed. 
I know that'll be difficult to do. 
How are you planning to do that? 
It's beyond me! 
I'm a bit out of shape. 
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else? 
It's going to be difficult to find someone to replace Tom. 
I should've been more careful. 
Tom and Mary thought they were being cute. 
I thought that you had learned that by now. 
I never said that I could understand French. 
Tom is just as smart as Mary is. 
They wished they hadn't said that. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is planning to quit his job. 
Tom told me that he hoped that Mary would be motivated to do that. 
I'm going crazy! 
Tom thought that Mary would be embarrassed. 
I hope that I get a chance to go to Boston. 
I'm glad that no one's around. 
Tom said that he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her. 
I don't think that we have a choice. 
Tom wasn't able to defend himself. 
Do what Tom tells you. 
Saturday is the last day of week. 
I know Tom will likely know how to do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary would be grumpy. 
I know Tom knows why we didn't that on Monday. 
Who's your favorite singer? 
I promise you that I'll help you. 
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do that again. 
Tom thinks that he left his umbrella on the train. 
I'm a lot taller than Tom is. 
I know Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too. 
I know Tom would be quicker at doing that than Mary. 
My handwriting's better than Tom's. 
Hello, what is your name? 
They say they won't be here tomorrow. 
Tom said that he had a lot of fun in Boston. 
I assume that this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor. 
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid. 
I know Tom knew that I was planning to do that. 
You should have been able to do that much better. 
We work every day except Monday. 
I know that you weren't the ones who did that. 
Tom said that he doesn't have the power to stop it. 
I know Tom and Mary are married. 
I should have been here yesterday. 
It's not heavy. 
That's the reason that Tom went to Australia. 
I thought that you were excited that I was getting married. 
Tom told me that he'd likely cry. 
I thought that they'd find somebody else. 
I was the only one there who knew Tom didn't want to do that. 
I doubt very seriously Tom did that on purpose. 
I figured that you might be busy now. 
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves. 
I don't think that this is an exception. 
I know that you don't like me very much. 
I thought that it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today. 
Tom has lots of things he wants to do today. 
Tom said that something the other night about that. 
Tom admitted that he wasn't brave. 
I know I should have done that. 
Tom said that he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer. 
I suspect that Tom is waiting for us. 
Dogs that are dead can't bite. 
I don't think that Tom is as crazy as some people think he is. 
I don't think that I'll be able to do that by myself. 
Tom doesn't think we'll find anybody who can do that for us. 
She avoided his look. 
Tom isn't as fat as me. 
I don't think that Tom and I can do that by ourselves. 
Tom says Mary is still planning on doing that. 
I thought that Tom must be mistaken. 
Tom said that Mary didn't care what he did. 
They said they didn't like this. 
Tom was the reason that Mary moved to Boston. 
I should have introduced myself. 
Tom said that Mary is looking forward to being retired. 
I can't recall when he moved to Boston. 
I've never fallen in love with anybody. 
This is the first time that Tom has ever complained about that. 
Tom is liked by everybody. 
I didn't think that anyone thought you're crazy. 
He doesn't have a mobile. 
I think that Tom will ask you to marry him. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself. 
There isn't any need for Tom to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't have permission to do that. 
I suspect that Tom is involved. 
How many kilograms have you lost? 
Tom and Mary are both OK. 
I am a despicable human being. 
I'll never forget the time when you and I went to Australia together. 
Tom isn't the only one who's planning on staying with us tonight. 
Both Tom and Mary have decided not to leave. 
Tom told me he's sleepy. 
Mary tried her mother's clothes on. 
Tom admitted he stole Mary's bicycle. 
I pried the lid off. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to be in Australia now. 
Tom said that he doesn't want to do that here. 
I'm three years older than you. 
When's your birthday? 
They said they were hurt. 
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for somebody. 
I would have helped you. 
I didn't know Tom and Mary were already married. 
I didn't hurt anyone. 
We can't play baseball here. 
Tom and Mary say that they won't mind. 
I am not in the mood 
I thought that you said that you had fun doing that. 
Where'd you learn to do that? 
I don't think Tom and Mary know anybody in Boston. 
I've been on a diet for more than a year. 
Tom said that he wasn't willing to help us do that. 
Tom thought that Mary already had a driver's license. 
I know Tom is a fairly good drummer. 
Tom realized he wouldn't be able to change anything. 
Tom said Mary should have done that alone. 
I didn't know that you were still living with your parents. 
Tom said that he wanted to buy a weathervane. 
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian? 
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore. 
I suspect that Tom is at home, sleeping. 
Tom and Mary told me that they'd do that again. 
Tom vomited. 
Tom does not like this color. 
Tom must have left the water running. 
I am a farmer. 
It isn't easy being married to Tom. 
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't concerned. 
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted to. 
Tom said that he's a Canadian. 
I would like to have another cup of coffee. 
I presume Tom is still married to Mary. 
Tom said that everybody he knows enjoys doing that. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary were here yesterday. 
I know Tom can probably do that sometime today. 
Do you allow your children play in the street? 
I can't believe that Tom and Mary are gone. 
Tom doubts Mary can do that. 
There's a cat under the desk. 
I think that Tom is unkind. 
I don't think that Tom knows when it happened. 
Is it true that Tom is moving to Boston? 
Tom said that he didn't want to live in Australia anymore. 
I thought that you looked tired. 
Tom said that I looked impatient. 
I think that Tom could make Mary do that. 
I'm interested in chess these days. 
I don't think that I'd like living in Australia. 
Tom said Mary should've done that alone. 
My parents died when I was three years old. 
I think that Tom was misled. 
What you're saying is absolutely wrong. 
He's depressed. 
I know that I have to help Tom tomorrow. 
I don't think that Tom has a girlfriend now. 
Tom said that Mary is thirsty. 
They said they didn't enjoy doing that. 
I'm peeling apples. 
They said they'd never study French. 
They said they thought I was creative. 
Tom told me that he's not certain what he should do. 
Tom told me that I should have said yes. 
Tom didn't press the button. 
There was nothing left in the refrigerator. 
Tom said he knew that Mary might not need to do that. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't likely have to do that. 
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well. 
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there on time. 
I think Tom and Mary are both going to be busy tomorrow. 
Tom said that he knew that I might have to do that. 
Tom said that he didn't want Mary to do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't plan on going with us this weekend. 
I don't think that Tom is sure that that's what Mary wants to do. 
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars. 
Everyone loves free stuff. 
I don't think that this is funny. 
If Tom does that, so will I. 
I know Tom is still in his office. 
Tom and Mary said that they're prepared to help me. 
Tom isn't the one who told me Mary should do that. 
I thought you said that you'd still like to do that. 
Tom said that he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that or not. 
They say they're not planning on going. 
Tom is a very nice boy. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anybody to do that. 
Tom said it was Mary who told him that he should do that. 
Tom doesn't think that Mary is annoyed. 
I don't think that I can hold on much longer. 
Tom isn't as tall as Mary is. 
Tom said that he didn't think the heat bothered Mary. 
I know that you're a coward. 
You're not telling the truth. 
I told Tom I disagreed. 
I think that Tom is talking to Mary now. 
I've already promised Tom that I'd help him. 
I believe everybody deserves a chance. 
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting. 
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today. 
I don't think that you really want to call attention to that. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary was the one who did that. 
I thought that Tom and Mary were going to kill John. 
Please leave the lights on. 
Tom said that Australia is a nice place to visit. 
I thought that Tom was in big trouble. 
I listened to everyone. 
That doesn't work. 
Tom's speech lasted three hours. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is alive. 
I may try to borrow a hatchet from Tom. 
Tom might be surprised. 
I don't think that anybody would want to see that movie more than once. 
I can't recall anything else at this time. 
Tom needs to know somebody cares. 
I think that Tom won't be in Australia very long. 
Tom told Mary that he'd never be coming back here. 
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself. 
I suspect that Tom will never agree to do that. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary wants to buy. 
He can't stop me. 
I think that Tom is irresponsible. 
I thought that it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two. 
I know Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday. 
I think Tom is doing something illegal. 
Our streets flood when it rains. 
I'll probably be busy this afternoon. 
I don't think that you have much choice. 
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning on doing that. 
I knew Tom might be permitted to do that again. 
Tom gave the last piece of cake to me. 
I know Tom is a very good drummer. 
We know that you're working for them. 
Everybody here but Tom has done that. 
I think you should do it yourselves. 
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of. 
Tom knew he could have done that better. 
Tom said that he wished that Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was displeased. 
I wonder whether it's safe to camp here. 
Tom said that they wouldn't let him do that. 
I'm a university student. 
I think that Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong. 
What country are you from? 
Both Tom and I are students. 
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everybody. 
I know Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she needs to do that. 
I don't think that it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves. 
Are you saying that you don't want to do this? 
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that. 
I can assure you that isn't going to happen. 
Tom plans on sitting in the back. 
Tom said he'd given Mary a book. 
It would've been unbearable. 
I know Tom will probably know how to do that. 
I know Tom was a scrawny kid. 
Tom said that he had no reason to stay. 
Tom and Mary know that they're partly to blame. 
I'm not surprised Tom plans on doing that. 
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win. 
Don't twist my words. 
I didn't think Tom realized how difficult that job was going to be. 
Tom and Mary are waiting for somebody to help them. 
Why don't you put your jacket on if you're cold? 
Tom knows that he can trust me. 
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long. 
I hear you've quit smoking. 
Obviously, Tom doesn't want to do that. 
I don't think that Tom really likes doing that very much. 
Tom might be awake now. 
It isn't reasonable. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was divorced. 
Tom told me he was next. 
Tom said that Mary knew that John might have to do that by himself. 
Tom said that he was good at speaking French. 
This isn't salt. 
Has anybody here seen Tom? 
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong. 
My dog sleeps in the same room I do. 
He didn't keep his word. 
I know that isn't true. 
Tom said he's planning to do that. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible. 
I know Tom can speak French better than I can. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow. 
I know that you aren't ready to deal with this. 
Tom and Mary said that they acted in self-defense. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary had been careful. 
Tom was asleep on the living room couch. 
I found out Tom and Mary both like romance novels. 
Tom knows that I didn't do that yesterday. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary were busy all day. 
Tom told everybody he was prepared to do that. 
We'll go on a picnic if it's fine tomorrow. 
Promise me that you won't tell anybody 
It isn't Tom who needs protection. It's Mary. 
They said they're irritated. 
I think that Tom will probably be able to do that. 
Tom did that whenever he was able to. 
They said their houses weren't for sale. 
I'm not fat! 
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that. 
I think that we have more important things we should be doing now. 
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once. 
I don't think that I know anybody here. 
They say they want to win. 
Tom knew Mary was a teacher. 
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be sleepy. 
Can someone help me, please? 
I know Tom is about the same age as your daughter. 
I know Tom is a very lucky guy. 
Tom thought that I might not be permitted to do that by myself. 
Tom thought that he could do that tomorrow. 
I know that Tom is easygoing. 
I think that Tom will be lonely. 
It seems like Tom likes everybody. 
I'm surprised that Tom wasn't here yesterday. 
Mary has to settle into her new flat. 
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week. 
I don't think you need to tell Tom that you plan to do that. 
They swore they'd never done that. 
Everybody stood there, shocked. 
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think that we should do that. 
Tom told me that he wasn't offended. 
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should have been. 
Tom doesn't look too well. 
Tom said he thought that I should do that by myself. 
I don't think Tom looks like his brother. 
Tom said that he heard noises in the kitchen. 
I don't think that Tom knows if Mary is sleepy or not. 
I know that I made a mistake. 
You were surprised I did that, weren't you? 
They wished they could fly. 
What a beautiful sunset. 
I've seen Mt. Fuji. 
Tom didn't know the bridge was closed. 
They said that they don't like doing that. 
I thought Tom would've found Mary by now. 
Tom said that he wouldn't mind if Mary did that. 
You shouldn't just assume that Tom is guilty. 
Watch yourselves! 
Mary said that she wasn't planning to do that. 
Someone's got to tell Tom what to do. 
I didn't know Tom did that was when he was thirteen. 
Tom said he doesn't think that you can win. 
Both Tom and I are vegetarians. 
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him. 
Enough is enough. 
I wonder whether or not Tom knew I needed to do that. 
Did you know Tom did that? 
I guess that it's like that everywhere. 
Tom and Mary both lived in Boston when they were children. 
It isn't until you have lost your health that you realize its value. 
That could have hit me. 
They told me they're losing weight. 
My house isn't big. 
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that. 
You didn't know that I was still planning to join the team, did you? 
The bathroom wasn't very clean. 
They said that they were safe. 
Tom said that he didn't think that he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him. 
Tom thought that Mary would be the first one to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was ambitious. 
This is something I made for you. 
I don't think that I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music. 
Tom said that he thought he could do that if he had some help. 
Except for Tom, everybody did that. 
She has been sick for three weeks. 
Tom said that he wished he could speak French better. 
I'm not able to dance. 
Tom doesn't have a prayer. 
Tom said that he thought you could take care of yourself. 
I know Tom knew I was the one who had to do that. 
Tom isn't missing, is he? 
I've left my umbrella in the phone booth. 
I did something bad. 
I suspect that Tom would be interested in doing that. 
I've promised Tom I'd do that. 
I thought that Tom would never show up. 
It is too good to be true. 
Tom said that doing that would be fun. 
Tom found it difficult to be obedient. 
Zucchinis are green. 
I never should have broken up with Mary. 
I wish that I were in Australia right now. 
Tom knew I'd be early. 
Tom tossed some bread to his dog. 
What has this got to do with us? 
How do I know that you're telling me the truth? 
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that. 
That is just not possible. 
I'm afraid that we can't do anything. 
I'm pretty sure that I can do that. 
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together. 
Why did you fail the entrance examination? 
Tom found it difficult to remain impartial. 
Tom told me that he had to leave. 
Tom says that he can't prove that Mary did that. 
Tom and Mary told everybody they were bored. 
Tom said that he's glad that you're coming. 
Tom thought that Mary was really mean. 
I know there will be a lot of good food at the picnic. 
Has anyone got any questions so far? 
I suspect that Tom is reluctant to do that. 
Tom was never afraid of anyone. 
They said they'd rather come next week. 
What're you referring to? 
Tom said he thought that Mary was amused by what was going on. 
Everybody in the room did the same thing. 
They're inseparable. 
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that. 
They promised they wouldn't do that. 
I really thought that Tom would do that. 
You must have done that last year. 
Could you take my picture? 
We should have expected that to happen. 
It would have been wise to do that. 
Tom told me he doesn't have a problem with that. 
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have walked home alone. 
Tom must be irritated. 
How long has your head been hurting? 
Thanks, buddy! 
Tom said that nobody was fired. 
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here? 
He's got earache. 
I don't think Tom wants to do that alone. 
I'm not certain I can trust Tom. 
Tom said that it was Mary who told him he needed to do that. 
Tom was sentenced to life without parole. 
I'm assuming the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom. 
It's not just my problem. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was high. 
I know Tom is a millionaire. 
Tom said he thought that doing that would be safe. 
I don't think that I'll permit Tom to do that. 
No pain, no gain! 
I admit that I've done that. 
I think that Tom doesn't eat meat. 
I hope we don't have problems with Tom. 
Here's your bag. 
This is the first time that Tom has ever complained about the noise. 
I'll never tell anybody. 
Tom didn't know that Mary was a Canadian. 
I think that Tom is a good coach. 
Tom and Mary told me that they could help us. 
I don't think that it's unethical for you to do that. 
Tom said that he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived. 
I know that we can't count on Tom to do that for us. 
I thought that Tom dumped Mary a month ago. 
I think that Tom won't be the last one to do that. 
Tom would have done the same thing you did. 
I don't think that Tom is downstairs. 
I need to know we can depend on Tom. 
Tom said that Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that. 
I realize that isn't very likely to happen. 
They say that that drug isn't safe. 
I know that it's highly unlikely that anybody can help me. 
I think that Tom is going to call you. 
I didn't know that you were such a superstitious person. 
Tom said that he thought that it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened. 
Tom thought that Mary would likely not cry. 
This heavy workload is too much for me. 
That never would have happened if you'd done what I told you to do. 
I wonder whether or not Tom wanted to go to Boston with us. 
I can not. 
We need to replace our hot water heater. 
Does anyone have a tissue? 
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer. 
We've done that already. 
Tom is a haemophiliac. 
I would've said nothing. 
Tom said that he'd be happy to answer any questions we had. 
Tom said that he knew that you could do that. 
Both Tom and I are wrong. 
I assume that you still enjoy drinking beer. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary were able to do that. 
What is your mother's name? 
I don't think that Tom is the person that you should be talking to. 
Sami knows what I am talking about. 
I'm not sure that I'm ready to do this. 
Tom said I had to study French. 
You're not obligated to do that, are you? 
You have a big head. 
He is very smart. 
I never would have hired Tom. 
Does Tom know you've already done that? 
Tom ate more than me. 
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday. 
Tom said he didn't think that anyone could do that. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still willing to do that. 
Did anybody go to Australia with you? 
Tom said he thought that I'd want to do that. 
Tom said that he wanted me to show him how to do that. 
I hope that this is enough food for everyone. 
Tom said that I shouldn't leave early anymore. 
I know Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that. 
Tom said that I should come home soon. 
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they aren't careful. 
Tom would have done that. 
I didn't know Tom told Mary that he wasn't going to do that. 
I want to visit Boston again. 
With teaching and studying all of my time is taken up. 
I think that Tom is conceited. 
I don't think that Tom would like it if we did that. 
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that. 
They say they'll quit doing that. 
Tom's incompetent. 
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish. 
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did. 
Tom said he thought that he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary. 
Tom and Mary said that they told you. 
Tom said he thinks that Mary can't do that. 
I know Tom is a golfer. Maybe he could teach you how to play. 
I thought that you knew Tom and Mary were married. 
I knew Tom would be able to do that without some help. 
I suggest that you don't go to Australia in the winter. 
What else do you plan on doing? 
I think Tom understood everything. 
I know that you're happy about that. 
Tom is downstairs. 
I know that Tom is talkative. 
It is not my business. 
Mary's got a big postcard collection. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't have enough money. 
Tom says that you're willing to help. 
I assume that you would like to meet Tom. 
I don't think that Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston. 
I wonder whether Tom kissed Mary goodnight last night. 
I don't think that anybody saw us. 
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student. 
It's unlikely that Tom will do that. 
Is it difficult to milk a goat? 
Do you think that we'll ever find our way back to the campsite? 
Tom doesn't know that I have three cats. 
I should have quit while I was ahead. 
Is anybody alive here? 
I thought that I told you to keep the door closed. 
My grandma texts faster than you. 
Do Tom and Mary both live in Boston? 
Let's hit the slopes. 
What's your favourite word? 
Tom knows that he made the right choice. 
I thought that you said that you'd do that for Tom. 
I didn't think that anyone noticed what you did. 
I wonder if I could help Tom. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was interesting. 
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you? 
Get out of here! 
I know this isn't difficult. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet. 
I thought that you might be hungry. 
I assumed Tom had told you that I would be here. 
Did you know that Tom was going to be in Australia all week? 
Tom said that he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him. 
You aren't still afraid, are you? 
I thought that you'd cry. 
The value of health can't be overestimated. 
You'll suffer because of that. 
I don't think that Tom knows exactly how much it'll cost. 
Tom said that he's healthy. 
I know Tom is nice. 
Tom already knows Mary is planning to do that. 
Don't take your gloves off. 
Keep it up. 
Tom said that he wasn't going to do that again. 
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that. 
Tom said that he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary should have done that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was unfriendly. 
Put on your pants. 
They said they weren't ready to talk. 
I know Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that. 
I admit that I've despised Tom since the first time I met him. 
Are there many Africans in Germany? 
Where did you put the TV guide? 
Tom said that Mary wasn't pretty. 
It's true that the earth is round. 
Tom could not help smiling. 
Tom doesn't like people to know he can't speak French well. 
Check that girl out. 
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be handicapped. 
I told Tom that you had come to Australia. 
Tom thinks that that's a mistake. 
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy. 
Tom thought that Mary was downstairs. 
I didn't want to admit that I couldn't do that. 
Tom said that he was ready to do whatever was necessary. 
Tom said that he owes Mary a lot of money. 
Tom said that he thought I was creative. 
Sorry, but I can't have dinner with you tonight. 
It isn't safe to go out after dark by yourself. 
Did you know that Tom had a son? 
Tom knows that Mary likes Boston. 
Tom and Mary said that they isn't likely to win. 
Tom told me he'd been forgiven. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would do that tomorrow. 
Tom knows that there's only one course of action possible. 
Tom and Mary said that they tried very hard to win. 
They say they lost their keys. 
I've decided not to ever do that again. 
I didn't know you were dating Tom. 
I think that Tom hasn't made a decision yet. 
I know that you still want to do that. 
Please tell Tom and Mary that they aren't required to do that. 
Good job, guys. 
I know Tom doesn't know he isn't supposed to be doing that today. 
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that. 
Tom hopes that he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year. 
Don't you know everyone is talking about us? 
Tom said that Mary knew that he didn't want to do that until next Monday. 
I know that Tom's house is for sale. 
I don't think that Tom is sad. 
I don't think that Tom will really win. 
I would've wanted to do that with you. 
I am uninterested in sex. 
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was strict. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might have to do that by herself. 
We wish we could have done more to help. 
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight. 
I promised Tom that I'd be home early. 
Tom said that he would look at it. 
Tom said that doing that was more difficult than he thought it would be. 
You would have loved the movie. 
They told me they don't really care what happens. 
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's speech was. 
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that. 
I'm sorry that I bothered you. 
Everybody seems to be afraid but you. 
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and he would end up telling them everything. 
Was the book that you were reading yesterday in French? 
I am a damage doer. 
Tom didn't know that I was from Australia. 
You could have gone. 
Tom said that he didn't think that the smell bothered Mary. 
He thinks that I am in love with her. 
I thought that you were a better chess player than this. 
I'm glad to see Tom is happy again. 
I thought that Tom had already left. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that. 
I don't think that we have much time. 
Tom said that he's trying to hide Mary. 
I don't think Tom would have done that for me. 
Tom is the funniest person that I've ever met. 
I doubt that Tom really plans to do that. 
Tom said he thought that Mary might not have to do that this week. 
I know that Tom knows he didn't need to do that. 
To tell the truth, I'm not your father. 
I don't think that Tom will be doing that with Mary. 
That's the real reason that Tom ran away from home, isn't it? 
I thought that you might walk Mary home. 
Tom said he hopes that Mary tries to do that. 
You like chocolate, don't you? 
I don't think that Tom really had to do that this morning. 
Tom says he knows that Mary can't speak French very well. 
Tom hasn't told me where he's planning on staying in Boston. 
Tom didn't need to come here. He could have just called. 
They said they enjoyed the challenge. 
I know that Tom was late. 
Tom told me that he was going home. 
Tom told me he had lost his textbook. 
No one knew that Tom was going to do that. 
Correct! 
I thought that I might need to do that. 
I'm fairly certain Tom doesn't have any siblings. 
I think that Tom was the one who wanted to do that. 
I suspect that that's not going to happen. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are really telling the truth. 
Do all of you think this is a good idea? 
It must've been broken during shipping. 
They said they might not win. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was a good cook. 
They haven't admitted they did that yet. 
Everyone except Tom knew that he didn't have to go to Boston. 
I knew Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday. 
I know Tom is someone that we can trust. 
If I could have spoken French better, I might've gotten that job. 
Are you feeling okay today? 
Tom and Mary said that they'd be able to do that. 
These turtles aren't native to California. 
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't want to go to Boston. 
They said they're Canadian. 
I know that you feel grateful. 
I know Tom is a prison guard. 
Tom hopes Mary knows that she shouldn't do anything John is asking her to do. 
Tom said that he hoped that he'd be able to buy what he needed for $300. 
Tom said that Mary thought that she was the only one who had to do that. 
Tom and Mary both joined the army when they were eighteen. 
I knew Tom knew who did that for Mary. 
Thou shouldst smell the roses. 
Tom said that he didn't like dogs. 
Tom told me he thinks that he'll win tomorrow. 
I'm really sick of life. 
Tom thought that Mary's dress wasn't appropriate for the occasion. 
Do you have kids? 
Tom said he's glad that he didn't do that. 
I wonder if Tom is really finished. 
I don't think that anyone can do this. 
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning on doing that? 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was too young to drive. 
I'll be back. 
I don't think that Tom is nosy. 
I would have never done that. 
I believe that we don't in fact need to do this. 
Tom could have been quicker at doing that than Mary if he'd tried harder. 
I knew Tom told Mary that he wasn't going to do that. 
In my opinion, you're wrong. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was deaf. 
I don't think that I'll go out today because it's quite cold. 
Tom certainly made it clear he didn't want Mary to attend the party. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't want to do this. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't forgotten to buy Mary a birthday present. 
I wonder whether or not Tom would like to play poker with us. 
I don't think that anybody can do that. 
I thought that we'd already been over all this. 
I know that Tom is a lot smarter than me. 
Tom said that he isn't sure that Mary should do that. 
I don't think that Tom is interested in going to Boston with us. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was a good cook. 
Tom felt someone touch his shoulder. 
I know that Tom isn't a history teacher. I think he's a science teacher. 
Who did Tom plan on staying with? 
Tom assumed everybody knew what to do. 
Somebody stole my lunch. 
I know Tom won't tell Mary why he's going to do that. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary needed to do that. 
Tom doesn't know anything about the plan. 
Tom told me that he had a few things to take care of. 
I didn't know that I didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom told me that he'd be busy on Monday. 
I didn't want to wake the kids up. 
I know I'll be arrested. 
That's more like it. 
I think you could've done this by yourselves. 
Did you know that Tom wouldn't win? 
Tom said he thought that Mary was in danger. 
I didn't think anyone could do this. 
How do we know that you're not lying to us? 
I think you'd all agree Tom is one of our best singers. 
Tom didn't know Mary was in pain. 
I'd have gone to Boston if I could have. 
You were planning on taking pictures, weren't you? 
I don't think that Tom knows what he has to buy. 
He's happy. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary was having a good time in Boston. 
Your actions please the gods. 
I don't feel too well. 
I thought it would be difficult to do that. 
I suspect that Tom isn't eager to do that. 
I'm convinced Tom did nothing wrong. 
I know Tom won't need to do that anymore. 
Tom said that Mary was happy that he didn't do that. 
You aren't a city girl, are you? 
They said they'll be there. 
Heaven knows that we've done everything we can. 
I think that Tom will want to see this. 
Why does everybody think that Tom and I are stupid? 
Life is not fair. 
You should have seen the look on Tom's face when I told him about what Mary did. 
Tom couldn't get his socks off. 
I don't think that Tom can win. 
I think that Tom didn't see me yesterday. 
What makes you think I'm lying? 
In a court of fowls, the cockroach never wins his case. 
Tom has already decided that he isn't going to stay here. 
I'll make a sandwich for you if you want one. 
It would have been better if you hadn't gone there. 
Tom said that he was really glad you were able do that. 
You aren't going to give up, are you? 
Tom said that he wouldn't walk home today. 
Most people think that they're above average. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was ticklish. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be gone by the time we get there. 
He went to the United States last year to brush up his English. 
Tom said that Mary probably won't do that. 
Tom won't likely want to do that on a day like this. 
Tom never mentioned that he had a girlfriend. 
I knew Tom wasn't a very good singer. 
I didn't know that you knew French. 
Tom said that he wants to change that. 
Why didn't you just say that you didn't want to do that? 
It's good that you don't have to study so hard. 
I don't think that Tom should sing. 
I wonder whether or not Tom can help us. 
Tom told me that he wasn't at all interested in going to the museum with us. 
Tom has many toys. 
I know Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday. 
Tom and Mary say they don't know when John is planning on doing that. 
Tom said that he found something strange. 
Both Tom and I got out of the car. 
I think that Tom will agree. 
Tom said that he didn't speak French. 
They said they lost their key. 
Tom said that he could do it. 
Tom won't be home until 2:30. 
He can understand everything I am saying. 
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom studying. 
I don't think that Tom knows why Mary has to do that by herself. 
No one but you could've done it this well. 
Tom told me he was impressed. 
What is happening there? 
I know Tom won't do that tomorrow. 
I don't think Tom has done that as many times as Mary has. 
They said they felt tempted to do that. 
The atomic number for iron is 26. 
Is this the first time that you've ever ice skated? 
You'd better go get dressed. 
It's a complete disaster! 
They say they aren't having any fun. 
I wish I'd gone to Australia with Tom. 
You're not answering me. 
I didn't think that Tom would help me do that. 
Tom and Mary both need this. 
Tom thought that Mary probably did that. 
I thought that I might have to do that. 
Do Tom and Mary know you've done that? 
Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary has to do that. 
Tom thinks that I'm a loser. 
Tom knows he should do that soon. 
Tom thinks Mary will leave. 
I don' think Tom expected to be here for so long. 
They told me they're well. 
Tom is one of the strangest guys I know. 
I won't tell anybody you were here. 
Tom said that he can speak French, but he can't really speak it. 
Do you think that Tom knew that that was going to happen? 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't spanked his son so hard. 
I know Tom is a clever kid. 
How much longer to you think that I need to stay in Boston? 
Tom and his wife have no children. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary couldn't do that. 
I don't think that I did as well as the teacher expected. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was too slow. 
It isn't like you have anything else to do. 
I hope I haven't gotten you in any trouble. 
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored. 
I knew that Tom would be annoyed. 
Tom said that I looked unhappy. 
Tom thinks Mary isn't the one who did that. 
I don't think that Tom and Mary will ever get married. 
They said they felt amazing. 
Tom and Mary say that they can afford it. 
The museum isn't open on Monday. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was stubborn. 
I thought that we talked about this already. 
Tom admitted he let Mary win. 
Tom said that he was glad you did that. 
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that. 
Tom didn't realize Mary was waiting for him. 
Tom's the only one in our office who doesn't speak French. 
It's so bad, it's good. 
Both Tom and Mary have decided to stay. 
It appears to me that you're mistaken. 
I thought that you'd laugh. 
I know Tom doesn't know that he shouldn't be doing that. 
They said the explosion woke them up. 
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that with Tom. 
Tom thought that Mary was homesick. 
They say they enjoy teaching French. 
Tom didn't tell anybody he needed to do that. 
Tom said that he's not sleepy. 
I thought that Tom had paid Mary, but apparently I was wrong. 
Please wake me up at 6 tomorrow morning. 
I wonder why Tom gave this to me. 
Where is my beer? 
I wonder if Tom told Mary she shouldn't do that. 
I can't believe that Tom would do such a thing. 
Tom said that the Mary's accident wasn't his fault. 
Tom thought that it was a dumb question. 
Tom said that he wasn't ready to talk. 
Nobody knew that. 
I don't think that I'll be able to eat all this. 
Tom said that doing that may cause problems. 
Everybody's doing well. 
Tom told Mary he didn't think John was glad that was going to happen. 
Tom said that he was forced to do that. 
Tom got bored. 
I only bought about half the things that I needed to buy. 
Tom told me that he wasn't discouraged. 
I want to believe that there's still a chance for us to be happy together. 
You're not fooling anyone. 
He does not want to live in a less developed country. 
I didn't know Tom liked to cook. 
Tom thinks that there's a chance that Mary won't be at the meeting. 
You're not in trouble, are you? 
Tom doesn't think Mary is glad that's going to happen. 
I don't trust anybody but myself. 
I don't think that Tom will be ready to do that. 
I know Tom and Mary don't usually take vacations together. 
I will eat it. 
I don't think that everybody gave up. 
I figured everybody was busy. 
Tom knows that Mary won't cry. 
Tom told me he thought Mary would be jealous. 
I'm not planning on doing that again. 
The boss said that we're fired. 
You stay here. Everybody else go outside. 
I know that Tom will be prudent. 
I think that Tom didn't want to leave so early. 
Leave the dog outside. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to be pessimistic. 
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted. 
Tom might be the last one to do that. 
I know Tom doesn't know I won't be able to do that. 
They said they would write to us. 
Tom and Mary said that they were artists. 
Tom is the only one who wasn't at Mary's party. 
Mary told me she'd left her husband. 
Tom told me that he couldn't walk. 
Your hair is really long. 
Tom is still learning everybody's name. 
I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary wants to do that. 
I don't think that it's anybody's fault. 
Tom can swim much better than I can. 
Do you already have plans for New Year's Eve? 
Tom said that he knew he might have to do that. 
I thought you said that no one was going to be here. 
I'm sure Tom will know the answer. 
Tom told everybody that he was depressed. 
It's a good thing Tom did that. 
That's my line! 
Tom's parents told him they thought that he was too young to get married. 
Tom said that he thought he'd find another job. 
Tom said that no one else was hungry. 
I doubt Tom is still single. 
Tom told everyone he was thirsty. 
I don't think that we should stay at the same hotel where we stayed last time. 
Did you even know his name was Tom? 
I should have kissed Mary. 
I thought that you said that you've seen Tom do that. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might want to do that this evening. 
It must've been a shock to you. 
Both Tom and I were wrong. 
All our blood passes through our kidneys about sixty times a day. 
I don't think doing that is a bad idea. 
She pressed her nose against the sheet of glass. 
I don't think that anyone really thought that Tom was happy. 
We should have gone to Boston last month. 
Tom should do that somewhere else. 
I don't think that Tom would ever marry someone like Mary. 
I need a doctor. 
Tom thought that it wasn't the first time Mary had done that. 
I don't think that it's good. 
It's marvelous. 
I wonder if Tom is really planning to quit his job. 
If I could prove Tom did that, I'd fire him. 
I eat sushi every chance that I get. 
I'll never violate a law again. 
I don't think that I'll be able to convince Tom to stop doing that. 
Tom didn't tell anybody who he was. 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be the first one to do that. 
I thought that Tom lived in Boston. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary wasn't happy. 
Tom said that he wished that he'd spent more money on the gift he'd given Mary. 
I don't think that it was fair. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are still safe. 
I don't think that we're going to do that until next week. 
Both Tom and I need new shoes. 
Tom said he would help me. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are married. 
Mary told Tom what she was planning to do. 
Tom said that he'd consider my idea. 
Tom is convinced Mary is innocent. 
I'm sorry that I forgot to tell Tom what to do. 
Tom said Mary was planning on doing that alone. 
Mary wore an anklet. 
Mary tried her wedding dress on. 
They told me they were happy here. 
I don't think Tom would be amused by what's going on. 
I know Tom is a lot like John. 
Tom should have let his children come camping with us. 
I wonder whether or not Tom's friends would help him. 
How did you know that I used to do that? 
Tom said that Mary wasn't having fun. 
Tom thought that Mary was unimpressed. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't planning to do that. 
Tom had planned on doing that yesterday. 
Tom promised he'd that go to Australia with Mary in October. 
I know Tom is a little crazy. 
I know that Tom probably won't help Mary do that. 
I'm sorry that I have kept you waiting so long. 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that. 
I thought that I'd go with Tom. 
It's marvelous. 
I wonder whether Tom is frightened. 
Tom said nobody else was hungry. 
They say they used to study French. 
I am a doctor. 
It isn't like I was trying to avoid Tom. 
I don't think that Tom knows Mary can do that. 
Tom told me his father was a teacher, too. 
The decision isn't yet final. 
I knew Tom knew who had to do that. 
Tom admitted that he despised Mary. 
I didn't know Tom lived in the dorm. 
I'm pretty sure Tom's right. 
I think that Tom did what he said he did. 
Tom isn't the one who borrowed my car. 
Tom was convinced Mary didn't have to do that. 
I forgot to buy a present for Tom. 
Tom said that he wanted to change out of his wet clothes into something dry. 
I know Tom isn't the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she ought to do that. 
Tom said he thought that Mary would be frightened by that. 
Tom told me that he thought that it would rain all day. 
Have you heard the latest rumors? 
Tom told me he thought Mary was unbeatable. 
Everybody here except you is from Australia. 
I think that Tom is here already. 
I can't come in to work today because I have to take my son to the hospital. 
Is that car yours? 
Tom is looking for somebody to teach French to his kids. 
Tom said that he doesn't have enough time to do that. 
Go and see if Mr. Wilson is at home. 
I think that Tom is fair. 
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that. 
Tom must have been hungry. 
Tom and Mary should've told John they were married. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was a good cook. 
Red, yellow and blue are colors. 
I know Tom is a good drummer. 
Tom thinks that Mary was in Australia. 
It isn't just Tom's fault. 
I know Tom isn't a very bright guy. 
With a little more effort, Tom would have succeeded. 
I should have done this months ago. 
That bridge is made of stone. 
I didn't know Tom knew why Mary kept doing that. 
There is no doubt. 
I know I made a mistake, but you don't need to rub it in. 
Tom's the best. 
I don't think that Tom will mind. 
Tom and Mary are both afraid of John's dog. 
I assumed that Tom would want to do that. 
Mary knows she's attractive. 
I thought that Tom would be more cooperative. 
I'm afraid that Tom won't be able to come. 
"Leave me alone," she said angrily. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was skinny. 
I should've told you about this earlier. 
I know that you must be terrified. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary used to live in Boston. 
Tom and Mary say that they're not happy here. 
You should have been a little more polite. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might not need to do that. 
I wish I were as good at talking to girls as Tom is. 
I knew that something wasn't right. 
I know Tom is going to want to do that. 
We'll take part in the marathon. 
Tom is a germophobe. 
I don't think that anybody will like Tom. 
You'd best follow the doctor's advice. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was difficult to get along with. 
I think that Tom is annoyed. 
Tell Tom that he should visit Australia. 
Tom and Mary said that they felt disappointed. 
I still make many mistakes. 
He walks a great deal. 
I didn't think that Tom would ever forgive Mary for doing that. 
Tom has a car, but he hardly ever uses it. 
Let's go for some ramen. 
I'm convinced that I'm right. 
Tom told me I'm last. 
Tom may not be willing to do that for you. 
I thought that you said that you'd rather not do that. 
I wonder whether or not Tom could help us solve this problem. 
I don't know whether Tom and Mary still live in Boston or not. 
Tom said that he didn't think he'd ever do that. 
I hope that Tom is coming to Australia with you. 
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius. 
The bread that I bought at the supermarket doesn't taste very good. 
In Japan, the new school year begins in April. 
I doubt Tom is still upset. 
That isn't what Tom and I are afraid of. 
I thought that Tom was overreacting. 
He's busier than Taro. 
Nobody tried to do that. 
I know Tom is a talkative person. 
They can't stop her. 
Tom said that his parents allow him to do what he wants to do. 
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Australia when he was a child? 
I wonder whether Tom knew Mary had to do that or not. 
I think that Tom didn't understand your explanation. 
Tom said that doing that would be OK. 
I doubt that Tom will be offended. 
I don't think that Tom was married at that time. 
Tom said that he wasn't likely to do that today. 
I wish I could have helped Tom. 
Tom told everyone he was lonely. 
It seemed that no one was in the village. 
What is your favourite fruit? 
To arrive at the source, you must swim against the tide. 
I know Tom is a better French speaker than Mary is. 
I thought that it was Tom, but it was John. 
What's happening? 
Tom said he thought that he could pass the test. 
Tom said he didn't think that Mary would do that on purpose. 
I hope that you get the chance to do that. 
Tom lent a lot of money to me. 
I wish I could've spoken French. 
Tom told me that he did that for us. 
Tom likes playing with this dog. 
I'm wasting my time. 
Tom said that Mary ought to do that in the other room. 
I should have advised Tom not to believe what Mary says. 
I think Tom hasn't left yet. 
I've already said I'll do that. 
Remember that we're all in the same boat. 
I wonder if we forgot to tell Tom to do that. 
You're a genius. 
Tom and Mary think they might have the answer. 
I think Tom might've done this. 
Tom said that he hasn't decided what needs to be done. 
Tom said that he liked the movie. 
French isn't my first language. 
I don't think Tom and Mary really plan on doing that this week. 
I must have fainted. 
Tom didn't know that you weren't supposed to do that by yourself. 
I wish that I didn't have to go to work today. 
Tom told me Mary got married last month. 
Tom promised to pay Mary three hundred dollars to babysit his children for the weekend. 
You startled me. 
Tom told me he'd be careful. 
Tom and Mary said that they're taught French before. 
Tom said that Mary wasn't planning on going anywhere. 
I must leave now. 
I knew Tom knew why Mary didn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might be required to do that right away. 
Tom and Mary told me they weren't feeling very good. 
I think Tom is on vacation. 
I know that I saw something move. 
Tom and Mary say they aren't planning to do that tomorrow. 
I knew Tom wasn't the only one who did that. 
I think we'd better wait another thirty minutes. 
I didn't know Tom knew anyone who was able to do that. 
I should have known Tom and Mary would be together. 
Tom told me he and Mary spent their summer vacation at the beach. 
Everybody but Tom knew Mary was in love with him. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are able to do that. 
They are wrong. 
I don't think that Tom would have fun doing that. 
They said they knew that I was coming. 
I don't want to be here any more than you. 
Is Tom planning on staying at home all day by himself? 
I know Tom will be quicker at doing that than Mary. 
I know Tom is a snob. 
I'm not sure that I need to do that. 
I can't accept this gift. 
Both Tom and Mary have decided to move to Boston. 
Tom and Mary said that they were thirty. 
It is time to reflect on your past. 
Tom didn't think that he would make it. 
Tom and Mary said they don't plan on doing that anymore. 
I know Tom is a good actor. 
Tom is innocent. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was terrific. 
I don't think that that's necessary yet. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was responsible for what had happened. 
Tom said he thought that I had to do that. 
Tom told me that he didn't have any enemies. 
Tom said that he didn't know how to swim very well. 
Tom said that he might do that. 
I'm absolutely certain this is where I parked my car. 
I thought that you were planning to be here earlier. 
I wonder whether or not Tom and Mary will get divorced. 
Tom told me that he came from a large family. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would like his friends. 
Tom says he hopes Mary knows that he doesn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he was planning to go to Boston next summer. 
I think that Tom has forgotten how to do that. 
Tom said that he knew Mary might be permitted to do that by herself. 
I know that you must be hungry. 
You know that I'm older than you are. 
Tom and Mary have allowed their children to do that many times. 
I thought that it might be cocaine, but it was only flour. 
I told Tom that you were busy. 
You might not be able to do that. 
Tom is going to be very upset if that happens. 
I wish that I were better at French. 
Tom says he has some paperwork that needs to be done. 
Tom isn't scared of anybody. 
They aren't sure they want to do this. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary ought to do that again. 
Where is my money? 
Tom and Mary said they hoped they'd be able to buy what they needed for three hundred dollars. 
I know I'm annoying. 
Tom would've been here if he could have. 
I know Tom is the only one who can't do that. 
Something has happened to her. 
I'm often confused with my brother. 
I knew Tom wasn't afraid of Mary's dog. 
I figured that Tom would mess up again. 
I wonder whether or not Tom likes to do that. 
I would have done anything in the world to help Tom. 
Tom gave some roses to Mary. 
Tom said he thought that I wanted to do that. 
I know I didn't do that the way you told me. 
Tom said that he didn't know any better. 
Their car passed ours. 
Mary says she isn't planning to do that tomorrow. 
You're watching. 
Tom says he knows that Mary won't want to go sailing unless he goes sailing with her. 
Tom told me that he did nothing wrong. 
I'm sure Tom should do that again. 
Tom told me he thought that he wouldn't be able to do that. 
They said they tried to win. 
Tom and Mary told everyone they were fine. 
I thought that Mary said that she didn't have a boyfriend. 
We must always be prepared against disasters 
I know you're eager to do that. 
I thought that you said you hated Tom. 
Tom said he thought that Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30. 
Now you mention it, I can smell it, too. 
Are you suggesting that I'm lying? 
Tom also talked to Mary. 
Tom said that Mary wasn't desperate. 
I don't think that Tom knows who's going to help Mary do that. 
You've confused the students. 
I suspect that Tom will come to Boston. 
It isn't safe to drink this water. 
I know that you don't know how to speak French. 
You could have warned me. 
Mr. Tatsuya deals in grain. 
I'm almost certain that that isn't the case. 
Tom told me he's not going to do that. 
I think that we can change that. 
I want to know what I'm doing is right. 
Tom said that I should've stayed and helped Mary. 
It wasn't a pleasant experience. 
Tom said that he couldn't remember anything. 
I'm familiar with the way he asks questions. 
I know that Tom isn't handsome, but I wouldn't say he's ugly. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was ugly. 
I don't think that I really have to do that again. 
Sooner or later, the police are going to catch you. 
He can't answer their questions. 
I know that Tom was amused by what was going on. 
I think Tom will eventually give up and let someone else do it. 
Tom said that he got out of the way. 
Tom said that he knew that Mary wouldn't be able to do that. 
I am European. 
Tom said he thought that Mary seemed depressed. 
Tom said that I looked busy. 
I don't think that Tom noticed we were there. 
It isn't as crazy as it sounds. 
Tom said that he hadn't intended to stay so long. 
I'm not sure that I'd be much help. 
I thought that you were supposed to be in Australia this week. 
I don't think that Tom was late. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be sympathetic. 
They showed us their photo albums. 
I guess you can't do it. 
Tom knew Mary was going to yell at him. 
Tom said he didn't think that it would be possible to do that. 
Tom said that everyone he knows enjoys doing that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they had to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't hungry. 
I doubt Tom will try to do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary really needed to do that this morning. 
I thought that Tom was interested in golf. 
Where'd you get those shoes? 
I think something is wrong. 
My brother is in Australia now. 
I think Tom's plan is better than Mary's plan. 
I need to get some shuteye. 
I am an introvert. 
I should have never come to Boston. 
Tom said that he'd try to convince Mary to do that. 
You're not helping a lot. 
I knew Tom was already finished doing that. 
I thought that you were teaching Tom French. 
They said they'd think about it. 
Tom said that he knew Mary might be permitted to do that in the near future. 
Tom left about 30 minutes ago. 
Tom said that he was glad that Mary could do that. 
I'm a high school graduate, so I guess that means I can answer high-school level questions and stuff. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is downstairs. 
I know that Tom will do whatever you ask. 
I know you're not stupid enough to believe that. 
Tom said that he wondered if Mary and I'd really be able to do that by ourselves. 
Tom should have refused to leave early. 
I didn't know Tom was the kind of guy who would do that kind of thing. 
I think that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she ought to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom would be fired. 
Tom didn't know someone wanted to kill him. 
Tom will be here for three more days. 
Tom seldom does that anymore. 
I suspect that Tom is optimistic. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was unmarried. 
I'm sure that I can overcome any difficulty. 
I don't think that you need to tell Tom what he needs to do. 
They knew they ought to do that. 
I'm pretty sure Tom can help Mary. 
I know that you did this. 
I'm very worried about my future. 
How could anybody do that to a child? 
I know Tom knows we don't need to do that. 
I know Tom doesn't know why he has to do that by himself. 
That's not exactly the way it happened. 
They told me they were certain. 
Tom said he didn't think that doing that would be much fun. 
Tom thinks that Mary always packs way too much in her suitcase. 
I know Tom can do that better than Mary. 
My heart is hurting. 
Tom has decided he's not going to stay here. 
Tom and Mary agreed to be here at 2:30, but they aren't here yet. 
By whom was this done? 
I knew Tom would be annoyed if you did that. 
They claimed they didn't cry. 
You know that Tom is very unlikely to do that, don't you? 
Tom said that he didn't think he had enough time to do that today. 
I've done everything that I've been asked to do. 
I know somebody has to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was the first one to do that. 
I know Tom is a bit old fashioned. 
I know Tom will be doing that with me. 
I wonder if we'll be all right. 
I thought that it wouldn't rain today. 
Tom and Mary told me they're depressed. 
It's not something that anyone would be ashamed of. 
I should've thought of that earlier. 
Is there anything else that you want to know? 
Tom said that he was glad you were able to do that when you were in Australia. 
I am against the death penalty. 
What are we doing here? 
I forgot to tell Tom that I intended to do that. 
I would've written a longer letter if I'd had more time. 
I didn't know Tom would care if you did that. 
I can't give you a definite answer today. 
I don't think that Tom would ever be able to do that. 
I knew Tom was a little under the weather. 
I think that Tom won't go. 
Tom might need to do that. 
Tom and Mary say that they were hungry. 
I don't think that I would've had the courage to do that. 
They thought they were going to be busy. 
I should have been truthful. 
I know Tom knows that I didn't need to do that. 
I have no doubt in my mind you're the woman I'm going to marry. 
He doesn't have a mobile.

I think that Tom might do that by himself. 
I don't think Tom knows what he did was wrong. 
I know Tom doesn't know that I've never done that. 
I know Tom is a lot shorter than me. 
There isn't enough cake for everybody. 
I don't think that I'll be able to finish the job by myself. 
You should have followed Tom's advice. 
I don't think that we should stay here much longer. 
On your mark, get set, go! 
Unfortunately, that's the case. 
Tom said that he knew where Mary learned how to do that. 
Tom said that he thought he wouldn't enjoy going to Boston with Mary. 
Tom said that he isn't having any fun. 
I know that Tom is a much better drummer than me. 
Tom told everyone he was lonely. 
This bag isn't small. 
Tom said that he knew he might have to do that tomorrow. 
You didn't know that you were supposed to do that today, did you? 
I think that there's still a chance that'll happen. 
Tom and Mary say that they don't do that. 
I thought that you said that you wanted to be the next one to do that. 
You didn't know that Tom had already done that, did you? 
Tom said that he didn't want to go to Australia with us. 
Tom thought that Mary was depressed. 
What's the capital of the United States? 
Tom put on some clean clothes. 
Tom said that it was the right thing to do. 
Tom said that he needed some cash. 
They said they'd never leave early. 
I know Tom said he'd do that. 
Do you remember the first time that you did that? 
Tom and Mary said that they're cautiously optimistic. 
Tom seemed surprised when Mary said that she wouldn't do that that. 
Are you sure that we'll get there before the others? 
Mary says she's planning to go to Boston with Tom. 
I knew Tom needed to do that again. 
They said they're doing that now. 
Tom said that I should've stayed in Australia for another week or so. 
I don't think that I'd ever need to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom is excited. 
Tom said his parents allow him to do anything he wants to do. 
I think that Tom is sane. 
Tom and I both aren't hungry. 
I know that Tom didn't know you had to do that. 
Tom and Mary told me that they ought to do that. 
Tom and Mary say everybody they know can swim. 
You should have phoned. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was clever. 
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't do that again. 
Tom said Mary knew that John might not be allowed to do that by himself. 
I'm having a very hard time. 
Tom gave a diamond bracelet to Mary. 
He kept silent for a long time. 
A squid has ten legs. 
Tom isn't willing to do that. 
She can't stop it. 
I didn't know Tom was so religious. 
I know that Tom knew he couldn't do that. 
It's more than we could've hoped for. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was unmarried. 
Tom and Mary said they're not planning on staying very long. 
Tom and Mary were both at home last night. 
Tom said that he plans on staying in Australia until October. 
I know that Tom isn't planning on going to Boston with you. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore. 
Who do Tom and Mary plan to do that with? 
You know Tom is a doctor, don't you? 
I didn't want to admit I was the one who broke the window. 
Tom said he was expecting Mary to be there. 
You're not leaving Japan for good, are you? 
I wonder if Tom is really going to do that today. 
How did you know that I was going to say that? 
I don't think that Tom knows anybody in Boston. 
Does Tom really think that Mary enjoys doing that? 
I've eaten nothing for the past three days. 
I thought that you said that no one was going to be here. 
We haven't been told yet. 
Tom said that he thought Mary wouldn't be interested in doing that. 
Mary says she doesn't plan to do that this week. 
Tom said that Mary should go. 
She's my favorite character. 
Tom said that he knew that you couldn't do that. 
They said they didn't want to leave. 
I wish I could speak English as fluently as you. 
Tom couldn't find a bottle opener, so he tried to open the bottle with his teeth. 
That book is helping you write effectively. 
I can't stand that man! 
I have irrational wants. 
Tom said that Mary should've stayed in Australia all summer. 
I'm afraid that I have bad news. 
I wish that you hadn't told me that. 
They told me they'd be back. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be ready by the time we got there. 
Tom should have helped Mary. 
They said they'd be willing to do that. 
I think there's a possibility Tom won't want to do that. 
Tom isn't a very friendly guy. 
I don't think that Tom knows if Mary likes him or not. 
I'm not sure that Tom would want me to give you that. 
I wish that we hadn't gone to Australia. 
They say they also want to do that. 
Tom and Mary took off their gloves. 
We're apt to make mistakes. 
I know Tom didn't know exactly how to do that. 
Tom said that didn't sound logical to him. 
They told everyone they were lonely. 
We have to escape this place. 
Tom would have liked to be here. 
You should've worked harder. 
I'm surprised that Tom didn't show. 
I wonder whether or not Tom knew Mary couldn't do that. 
I'm afraid that I spilled coffee on the tablecloth. 
Tom told everybody he was fine. 
I'm sure Tom that would do that if you asked him to. 
I don't think that Tom knows how much time that's going to take. 
Tom thinks that Mary lacks common sense. 
They don't know I wish they'd leave. 
I wonder whether Tom asked Mary to do that or not. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary had been impolite. 
What's the matter with you? 
Tom told me Mary was the one who did that. 
Tom told me he has decided not to eat any more junk food. 
Tom couldn't afford to pay for his mother's funeral. 
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom could speak French. 
It isn't OK to smoke here. 
I'm your friend, right? 
Has anybody told Tom? 
Tom said that he wanted Mary to do that by herself. 
Let's celebrate. 
Tom told Mary that he thought John was in Australia. 
Tom told everybody that he was discouraged. 
You should have told Tom about it while he was here. 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be courteous. 
Can you think of anyone who would have wanted to kill Tom? 
Tom said that he thought that he could do that for me. 
I thought that you said you enjoyed doing that. 
You could've drowned. 
Tom told Mary he was glad that was going to happen. 
We really need more American slang on Tatoeba, pronto! 
Tom said he didn't believe that Mary really planned on going with us. 
I know Tom would've done that for me. 
I don't think that the weather will clear up anytime soon. 
Both Tom and I like swimming. 
Tom said that he didn't want to go to the dance with Mary. 
Tom said that the pain started three months ago. 
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be gone by the time we get there. 
Tom pretended that he didn't notice Mary was staring at him. 
Tom thought that he had to help Mary. 
I'm going to New York next week. 
This language is unusually difficult. 
They realized they needed to do that. 
I'm sure that Tom needs to do that again. 
Tom must have been tortured. 
Last night I threw up. 
Everybody here but me has done that. 
Tom is almost as tall as Mary. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was upset. 
We have to protect our children. 
I assume that you've proofread this already. 
I don't think that you ought to do that until this afternoon. 
Tom said he hoped that Mary would like the gift he was planning on giving her. 
I thought that Tom didn't like you. 
I was surprised Tom didn't need to do the same thing that I needed to do. 
I thought Tom was likely to win. 
I can't help laughing at him. 
I don't think that I really have to do that. 
I know Tom is a heavy sleeper. 
I think that Tom will call you. 
It was the first time I visited the museum. 
Tom said that he hopes that Mary won't let John drive. 
What're you going to do with all that money? 
Why are you planning to do that? 
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you sooner. 
Fantastic! 
We're sorry it happened. 
I didn't notice Tom was doing that. 
Tom is about three years older than Mary is. 
It's important that we do that correctly. 
I think that Tom is only pretending to be asleep. 
I promise that I won't cry. 
Tom said he thought that I might not be required to do that by myself. 
I suspect that Tom is frustrated. 
Tom and Mary told me they needed some cash. 
I always knew that Tom could win. 
You are welcome! 
Tom showed me his stamp collection. 
We're here. 
Neither Tom nor Mary speaks French. 
What you said doesn't make sense. 
They told me they'll join us later. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are going to hate this. 
Tom said that he wished that Mary and I wouldn't go out after dark by ourselves. 
We couldn't see the top of the mountain. 
They told me they'll be back soon. 
You should have been able to do that without Tom's help. 
Someone is waiting for us in the lobby. 
I knew Tom was planning to tell Mary to do that. 
I've lost three kilograms. 
The same thing must have happened to Tom. 
I know Tom is almost as tall as me. 
Tom didn't read everything as carefully as he should've. 
We know Tom is unlikely to do that. 
I knew that Tom went to this school. 
I'm afraid that we'll have to start over again. 
I'm so sorry that this has happened. 
That's an interesting claim. 
You weren't surprised I didn't have to do that, were you? 
I'm familiar with this subject. 
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was as rich as he said he was. 
She isn't old enough to get a driving licence. 
His dream has come true. 
They promised they'd do that tomorrow. 
I think that Tom and Mary were both born in Australia. 
Why do you think Tom would do such a thing? 
I might go out if the rain lets up. 
I don't think that Tom enjoys hiking. 
Tom could have been present at today's meeting, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't. 
Tom and Mary say that they'll never give up. 
It may not be as difficult to do that as you think it'll be. 
Children, listen! 
They say they have no vices. 
Nobody in my family is a musician. 
Tom admitted that he was weak. 
Tom said that he's glad you were able to do that when you were in Boston. 
Tom and Mary think that they know what to do. 
I don't think that it's a good idea. 
I know Tom is picky. 
The wound has not yet healed. 
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do that. 
Tom said he didn't think that Mary would do that. 
I'm not sure that I want to do this. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was the last one to do that. 
I should've paid more attention in biology class. 
Tom said that he thought he was too young to do that. 
You aren't taking it, are you? 
Is there somewhere that we can talk privately about this? 
I guess that I could try. 
They aren't like people say they are. 
I don't think that I'll be busy next week. 
I don't think that I'm the person that you're looking for. 
I'm far from happy. 
I don't think that Tom has any friends living in Boston. 
Tom and Mary both complained about John. 
I know you aren't serious. 
Tom said that he'd never heard of me. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary knew how to drive. 
I never said that. 
Have a great weekend! 
I suspect that both Tom and Mary have already left Australia. 
Tom thought that it was going to hurt. 
It isn't worth much. 
This is real difficult. 
Tom will be surprised if you don't do that. 
Tom knew that Mary was with John. 
I promise that I'll be back soon. 
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long. 
They put on their boots. 
I thought that you came to see Tom. 
This should have been done a long time ago. 
I don't think that it's very likely that Tom will come over this time of night. 
I don't mince words. 
Tom said he thought he'd have to do that tomorrow. 
Tom should have done that weeks ago. 
Mary said she wasn't planning to go. 
Tom told Mary she should go home. 
I think that Tom is still motivated. 
I should have kept going. 
I thought that Tom was hungry. 
Tom thinks if he had tried a little harder, he could've won the race. 
Tom's lawyer wasn't surprised when the jury found him not guilty. 
What's the real reason that Tom didn't want to buy that? 
Tom assumed that everybody at school knew he'd been arrested. 
It isn't something I'm very good at. 
I thought that it was true. 
The books were so valuable that they were handled with the greatest care. 
You should have declined the invitation. 
I didn't know Tom told Mary he couldn't do that. 
I know Tom is a teacher here. 
Tom thought that he'd forgotten to tell Mary what to do. 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was pleased. 
I understand that nobody wants to help us. 
Tom and Mary told me they thought I should lose some weight. 
I know that you don't know either. 
If you want this pen, I'll lend it to you. 
I know Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that. 
I think it would be hard to do that. 
Tom told me he thought that you could do that. 
Tom doesn't know Mary was the one who did that. 
I know Tom is a bit taller than me. 
I don't remember. 
I should have been a movie star. 
Tom said that he hopes that you won't go home by yourself. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary used to play lead guitar in John's band. 
If it were possible, someone would have done it by now. 
Tom still needs to do that, I think. 
Tom said that he didn't need your permission to do that. 
Tom is eating. 
Tom said that Mary was willing to help you. 
I know that Tom is more handsome than I am. 
Tom and Mary said that they're glad to help. 
Tom knew he'd be busy on October 20th. 
I think I can do that better than you can. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are worried. 
Tom and Mary said that they couldn't wait. 
Tom said that the team remains confident. 
I wonder whether Tom wanted to sing or not. 
I don't think that Tom is unconscious. 
I know Tom isn't able to play the guitar. 
Tom said he didn't think that you should ask Mary to do that. 
He is a passive-aggressive teacher. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was in Australia. 
Tom doubts Mary can swim. 
It isn't easy for you, is it? 
Tom could have been the one responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was. 
Tom knew that I was uncomfortable. 
Tom told me he'll be back soon. 
It's obvious that Tom wants to do that. 
I think that it's a risk that anyone would've taken. 
I'm sorry that I forced you to do that. 
I thought you said that you'd rather do that yourself. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be scared. 
Tom doesn't want Mary to know he doesn't know how to do that. 
Tom vehemently denied that he'd done that. 
Tom should have told Mary that she was doing that the wrong way. 
Call me. 
You should have told Tom how you felt. 
We will take your suggestion into consideration. 
Eating too much is bad for your health. 
The paint is drying. 
Tom might be lost. 
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary is. 
Hi, my name is Tom. 
Tom said that he never wanted to get married. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would've done that. 
Tom is still dating the same girl he was dating three years ago. 
You aren't getting away from me that easily, Tom. 
Tom is going to give us everything we've asked for. 
Tom and Mary said that they were supportive. 
You are a drug addict like me! 
I think that I don't deserve it. 
I thought that Tom wasn't here. 
I'm speechless! 
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't know to swim. 
I don't think that Tom knows I love Mary. 
Thanks for coming. 
I doubt that Tom will leave anytime soon. 
Tom and Mary will both go. 
I thought that you said that you'd ask Tom to do that. 
Don't hang up. 
I probably sing better than Tom does. 
Tom's miserable. 
Didn't you know that there was a good chance this would happen? 
I wonder whether or not Tom will be at Mary's party tonight. 
Tom's the only one in our office who doesn't speak French. 
This isn't expensive. 
I didn't think that I'd ever have a chance to do that. 
I know that'll be hard to do. 
Tom must have missed something. 
I know someone had to do that. 
Tom said that he hoped he'd be able to win. 
Tom said he thought that Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
It's no big deal. 
Tom thinks that he's in love. 
It's not necessary for Tom to do that by himself. 
Tom said that Mary must do that. 
Tom didn't know that Mary used to live in Australia. 
I wonder if Tom still thinks Mary has to do that. 
I'm planning to send a birthday present to Tom. 
I don't speak French as fluently as you do. 
Tom has given a lot of things to me. 
I know Tom didn't know why you wanted him to do that. 
They said they weren't sure what to do. 
I should have listened to you. 
Do you have an umbrella that I could borrow? 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't mind. 
Federer held to love at 2-2. 
We should have studied harder. 
Tom said that he'd rather die than do that. 
I think I'm going to have to tell Tom everything. 
I know Tom didn't know who didn't have to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom is biased or not. 
It was obvious Tom didn't want to do that. 
Mary says she's planning to go tomorrow. 
I must've misunderstood. 
Tom baked a birthday cake for Mary. 
I think that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should do that. 
Tom said he didn't have time to answer all of my questions. 
Tom said that it should've been simple. 
I don't think that Tom knows how badly Mary was hurt. 
I assume that we're free to go. 
I don't think that anyone saw us. 
I know that you aren't stupid enough to believe that. 
I don't think that anyone could do that. 
Tom has agreed to babysit our kids next Monday. 
Tom said that he was sure that Mary wouldn't win. 
Tom said he's not sure Mary can take care of herself. 
Tom lived in Australia for three years when he was a child. 
I doubt Tom really plans on doing that this week. 
Is it true Tom tried to hang himself? 
Who are you calling stupid? 
I'm calling my brother. 
There's a good chance that Tom will do that for us. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't hurt me. 
Tom wasn't being completely honest. 
You could've just told me. 
Tom was just pretending he didn't understand French. 
Tom said that Mary was willing to do that for you. 
I thought that that was interesting. 
Tom is grieving. 
Tom told me that he won't be in Boston next week. 
Tom let me know that he was planning to stay in Australia for three weeks. 
Tom and Mary said that they've always done that. 
I cannot do it! 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary will do this evening. 
I know Tom knew why you didn't do that. 
There is no hot water. 
I like fruit such as grapes and peaches. 
Tom plans on staying with us when he comes to Boston. 
I don't think that you need to tell Tom what Mary did. 
Tom thought that it over for several days. 
Tom works at a store that's not too far from where he lives. 
You're very brave. 
Tom said he understands why Mary may not want to do that. 
Forget it! 
Tom said more than he should've. 
I thought that Tom wouldn't like the book Mary gave him. 
Tom said he thought that Mary wouldn't be doing that today. 
Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary didn't want to do that. 
I hope things stay peaceful. 
I can tear you apart with my bare hands. 
I thought Tom might be angry at you. 
I don't think that Tom is Mary's boyfriend. 
Tom said that he thought he should do that. 
Tom and Mary told me they're safe. 
Tom thought that he heard his name being called. 
We don't believe that that's true. 
This is a song I learned when I was a child. 
The way is long. 
Tom is a good carpenter. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to be in Australia next Monday. 
It's going to be hard to do. 
I thought that I'd try doing that again. 
Tom will be very disappointed if you don't eat the salad he made. 
We're both from Boston. 
I don't think Tom knows that I'm Mary's boyfriend. 
You lied to her. 
I'm not sure, but I think that Tom wants to be a teacher. 
I thought that it was an exciting story. 
They put down their forks. 
Tom and Mary said they were really sure they could do that. 
I think that Tom wouldn't like to do that. 
I must've made a mistake. 
Tom told everybody that he'd decided to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning on staying in Boston very long. 
I know Tom is a really successful musician. 
I didn't think that anyone did that. 
I didn't want Tom to know I wasn't going to do that. 
Tom and I both need help. 
Are you hungry, too? 
I doubt that we were ever in any real danger. 
Did you know that Tom was going to win? 
They say they don't think that they snore. 
The doctor said that this sickness is irremediable. 
Tom told me that he'd do that if I did that, too. 
I knew Tom would be permitted to do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't mean to hurt you. 
I don't think that Tom will come to school today. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary wants him to say. 
Is there any chance that you could help me get them? 
Are you sure that that's what you want to do? 
I know someone who can do that for you. 
I thought that I heard a mouse in the kitchen. 
I know Tom wouldn't make Mary do that. 
Tom put his glasses on. 
There's nothing God can't do. 
Tom said that he thought Mary hadn't been impressed. 
I've given this a lot of thought. 
Tom said he thought that the economy was in bad shape. 
I was living in Boston when I was thirteen years old. 
Quanto tempo atrás foi isso? 
I think that Tom is lovable. 
I'm buying a new car. 
In 1497, Zuan Caboto explored Canada. 
Tom and Mary told me that they cried. 
I didn't think that Tom was glad that that had happened. 
Do you think it'll be difficult for you to do that? 
Tom told me he likes to do that. 
I know that you're not like that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't going to win. 
I didn't think that Tom would be fired for doing that. 
I planned to do that yesterday. 
Tom knew right away he shouldn't have said anything. 
Tom and Mary say that they'll sing. 
There's a park near my house. 
I'm hoping that I'll be given another chance. 
You'll know the truth one day. 
Tom told me he won't come to school tomorrow. 
We found out Tom was the thief. 
Tom didn't have any desire to return to Boston. 
Mary made breakfast for her husband. 
It isn't bedtime yet. 
I think that Tom might be able to do that. 
I must've forgotten it. 
Know thyself! 
Don't say anything! 
I would've done it at that time. 
Both Tom and I are a little busy. 
Tom told me that he'd left his wife. 
It's probably going to be difficult for Tom to win. 
I knew Tom was doing that. 
I admitted that I didn't do what Tom told me I needed to do. 
They said they weren't retired. 
Tom says he isn't planning on doing that. 
Nobody else has complained. 
Tom told me that Mary was very hungry. 
Tom and Mary think they understand women. 
I didn't know Tom was transgender. 
They say they're going to beat you up. 
I think you should let Tom know you can't speak French. 
I knew that Tom didn't care about Mary. 
I didn't know that Tom had a house in Australia. 
I can't stand this heat. 
Tom and Mary say that they're not concerned. 
I'm just as surprised as everybody else. 
They thought they were being cute. 
I don't think that it matters who does that. 
I didn't know you were planning on doing that today. 
Why is Tom mad at Mary? 
They say they want something to eat. 
Tom helps anyone that asks him for help. 
I know Tom is a member. 
I doubt very seriously Tom will be here. 
That book is really old. 
None of us plan on staying here much longer. 
I know Tom isn't a dental student. 
I thought that you were supposed to doing that right now. 
Maybe Tom doesn't know he isn't likely to be fired. 
Tom wanted to keep walking, but Mary insisted that they stop and rest. 
I don't think that Tom knows how to dance. 
Since it rained, I didn't go. 
Tom knows that I'm at home. 
Four times two equals eight. 
They said they'd consider doing that. 
Tom said that he was asked to help. 
I didn't think that Tom would ever speak to me again. 
It isn't very windy today. 
Tom won't be here till 2:30. 
Tom is the only one that I know who has been to Australia. 
I promise I won't tell anybody what you did. 
They put on their swimsuits. 
Faster, Tom. 
You should've spoken more politely. 
If you'd been there, we would have had a good time together. 
Tom said that he wasn't happy here. 
I am speechless. 
Tom and Mary said that they like to do that. 
Both Tom and I are a little busy right now. 
They said they felt manipulated. 
I don't think that Tom would be motivated to do that. 
Tom said that it didn't look like Mary was having a good time. 
Tom told Mary that he wasn't interested in doing that. 
You should've at least told Tom and Mary that they didn't need to do that anymore. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't cry. 
I think that Tom would like to live in Australia. 
I thought that I could handle it myself, but I couldn't. 
It isn't evening yet. 
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary was going to do that. 
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was doing that by herself. 
Tom said that he could swim at least as well as Mary. 
That's the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. 
Tom plans on going soon. 
You aren't upset, are you? 
Tom said that he thought Mary was planning on going to Boston with him. 
Let's go to the park where it isn't noisy. 
I think that Tom has to do that. 
I thought that I wouldn't be gone long. 
Where're you going? 
Tom and Mary said that they'd overstayed their visa. 
She dreamt a happy dream last night. 
Tom and Mary are both very tired. 
I thought Tom and Mary were both under thirty. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't know what to do. 
I have to admit that I'm a little anxious. 
Tom dried his hands with the towel Mary handed him. 
I think that Tom's record speaks for itself. 
You have the same rights as everybody else. 
Tom and Mary said they planned to stay where they were. 
Eat whatever you want to. 
Tom said that he wouldn't try doing that again. 
Tom said that he thought that he wouldn't be able to do that until October. 
Tom said that Mary is sleepy. 
Tom said that he'd never leave early. 
I doubt that Tom would be that foolish. 
I'm not sure that I can do it. 
I don't think that Tom would ever consider doing that. 
How did you know Tom couldn't do that? 
Tom isn't on good terms with his family. 
Tom can see things Mary can't. 
Tom said that he hoped that he could figure out how to do that. 
Tom and Mary were both silent for a long time. 
I'm beginning to remember it. 
If I had the money, I would immediately purchase this computer. 
We are already mounting it. 
Tom and Mary said they'd make it on time. 
I don't think that Tom realizes how well Mary can speak French. 
Tom told everybody he was glad that that was going to happen. 
The price of rice went up three percent. 
They say they've been asked to help. 
Tom knows that he has no choice. 
Nobody should have died. 
Tom would have done that himself if he'd had known how. 
I hope Tom knows that he doesn't need to do that. 
He's sloshed. 
I would have done that for you if I'd had more time. 
I knew that Tom wasn't in Boston. 
Tom said that he thought it would be raining on Monday. 
Do you think that Tom would like to do that? 
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be hesitant to do that. 
They said they don't work on Mondays. 
I think Tom is expecting someone. 
I know Tom is a few pounds lighter than Mary. 
Tom said that he loves that kind of work. 
I know Tom didn't know who wanted to do that. 
Tom said that Mary was mistaken. 
They told me they needed money. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was planning on going to Australia with him. 
Wait. 
I didn't tell Tom that I grew up in Australia. 
Tom did that intentionally. 
I thought that Tom had a party last night. 
I know Tom didn't know that you needed to do that. 
Tom plans on doing that already. 
Who is the photographer? 
I knew Tom was a gun owner, but I didn't know he had so many guns. 
I did not understand. 
I'm lucky that I can still do that. 
They put away their phones. 
I think that Tom would've helped us if he'd been there. 
They said they were thrilled. 
They're doctors. 
Both Tom and Mary should've stayed awake. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't plan on going together. 
They said that they were bored. 
Tom could have given me more money. 
I don't think that Tom will want to go drinking with us. 
I'll watch TV. 
I don't think that Tom knows what time the meeting will start. 
Tom and Mary let us know they wouldn't do that. 
I don't think that Tom knows how much money was stolen. 
Tom and Mary are planning to stay in Boston for a few days. 
Keep off the grass! 
Tom and Mary said that they felt lonely. 
Tom said that we should be patient. 
Is it true that Tom used to live in Australia? 
Normally, we eat three times a day. 
Is it true that Tom thinks that I believe that? 
I'm playing volleyball now. 
They say they can't help. 
No one knows Tom hasn't done that. 
I don't think that anybody does that. 
Tom said that Mary wasn't the one responsible for what happened. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was hungry. 
I thought that Tom was with Mary. 
I knew Tom wouldn't be motivated to do that. 
It could have happened to anyone. 
I know Tom is alone in his apartment. 
I'm a woman. 
You know that you did the right thing. 
Tom should probably go home now. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to be early. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was well. 
I know you're not doing that right now. 
We already know that you did that. 
I think that Tom would be cooperative. 
Tom knows that he has to do something, but he isn't sure what. 
I'm sorry that Tom thinks that way. 
Tom said he hoped that he could win the race. 
Tom didn't know you were planning to stay. 
We're a team! 
Do Tom and Mary know wish they'd leave? 
Tom said that he thought that he'd be able to get that done by 2:30. 
Tom plans on going, too. 
Tom doubts Mary can take care of herself. 
Tom said he thought that Mary might need to do that. 
I don't think it's going to be hard to convince Tom to do that. 
Tom said that he figured that he'd be able to do that. 
Tom's happy. 
Tom and Mary are both conservative. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself. 
I'm praying. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was satisfied. 
I don't think that Tom knows the whole story. 
I don't think that Tom even saw me. 
Put your shirt on. 
Same for me. 
I'm the first musician in my family. 
Some people say true love doesn't exist. 
I'm not very good at sizing people up quickly. 
Tom told me I could use his computer. 
The first person that I met in Australia was Tom. 
Everyone but Tom knew that he didn't need to stay in Boston. 
Tom and Mary told me that they'd look into it. 
They know Tom means business. 
Tom said that Mary knew John might be permitted to do that after his birthday. 
I don't think was the problem. 
They told me they felt fine. 
Tom said that he really enjoyed dancing with Mary. 
Tom said that isn't the only reason Mary wants to do that. 
It's unfortunate that happened. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was downstairs. 
I know that Tom knows he shouldn't be doing that. 
Tom and Mary are planning to take pictures tomorrow. 
This man isn't my husband. 
Tom said that he didn't believe that. 
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know that I was going to do that. 
Tom must have been very tired when he got home. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom can't speak French. 
There's no chance that Tom will help us. 
I don't think that you can eat that. 
Tom said that he'll try to do that. 
I thought that it was hilarious. 
Tom works at a store that isn't too far from where he lives. 
I thought that you said that you didn't want to talk about it. 
I don't know anyone there except for Tom. 
Tom told me he was quicker at doing that than Mary. 
I don't think that Tom is still upset. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary had been fired. 
It isn't a bad plan. 
Did Tom know that you were planning on doing that? 
Tom convinced me that you were the best person for the job. 
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't do that for him. 
That water is not cold. 
I think that Tom stayed in Boston last summer. 
How anybody could vote for someone like that is beyond me. 
They said they were busy. 
I know Tom is in his room packing his suitcase. 
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy that for you? 
I don't think anyone saw us do that. 
Tom said that you speak French. 
I should have gone to the dentist last week. 
They told me they're shy. 
I don't think that Tom is adopted. 
I swear that I'm not high. 
Tom and Mary gave their old car to me. 
Tom said that he hadn't seen Mary for a long time. 
Both Tom and I know you did that. 
Tom told Mary that I was broke. 
I know Tom and Mary have both been sick. 
I can't understand why anybody would want to do that. 
Tom said that he's interested in learning how to do that. 
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do. 
They still hope they can do that. 
Tom said that he jumped out of the way. 
"Was anyone with you?" "No, I was by myself." 
Don't pretend that you're sorry. I know that you're not. 
Tom told everyone he was reluctant to do that. 
This box is quite heavy. 
I thought you said that you wanted to go to Boston. 
I met someone yesterday who knows that Tom. 
I know that you can't get away with this. 
Whenever somebody knocks on the door, my dog starts barking. 
Tom and Mary both have the same problem. 
There's no way you can do that by yourselves. 
I'm afraid that something is wrong with Tom. 
The bill was difficult to calculate. 
I want to know who's coming with us. 
I've never met anybody like you before. 
It would've been difficult to do that. 
Tom might be ready to do that. 
Tom is going to try to help Mary do that. 
It could've been worse. 
Tom thinks doing that wouldn't be a good idea. 
I regret I didn't tell Tom the truth. 
Both Tom and I didn't go to yesterday's meeting. 
Why didn't you come to the party? 
Do you think Tom is retired already? 
I wonder whether Tom still remembers how to do that. 
Didn't you know Tom used to live Boston? 
I don't think it'll rain, but I'll take an umbrella in case. 
Tom promised he would tell us. 
Tom said he didn't think that there was any need to hurry. 
Tom and I are both still high school students. 
You are making a big mistake. 
Tom says he saw a ghost. 
Tom thinks that Mary won't be lonely. 
Tom and Mary said that they would help. 
Did the umbrella that you found belong to Tom? 
Tom should have done much better. 
I know Tom is almost never at home on Monday. 
I think that Tom really does hate you. 
I know Tom will like doing that by himself. 
Tom said that he'd be retiring next October. 
I didn't know Tom played the trumpet. 
Do you think that it'll rain this weekend? 
I know that Tom probably didn't do what he was supposed to do. 
I don't recall asking you to do that. 
There's no way I'm going to let you do that. 
Tom told everyone he was lonely. 
I wonder if Tom is still busy. 
What's the name of our CEO? 
I know you've been worried about Tom. 
I thought that I did pretty well. 
Tom admitted that he was troubled. 
No one could hear what Tom was saying. 
Tom said that he'd visit Mary in Australia next summer. 
They are welfare queens. 
Not everybody is ready. 
There's going to be a storm. 
Tom must have been skeptical. 
Where is the meeting going to be held? 
I think that Tom is incorrect. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might not want to do that. 
I thought that it would be easy to do that. 
Tom says he hopes Mary knows that she has to do that. 
It isn't as cold today as it was yesterday. 
That's not a game for kids. 
I hope that you'll wait for us. 
Tom said that he hoped Mary would be here today. 
Tom said that Mary is worried. 
Tom and Mary said that they enjoy teaching French. 
Tom said he was really glad Mary did that. 
I wonder whether Tom found anything or not. 
I am from South America. 
I would have done that a different way. 
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary will come or not. 
I doubt Tom would've had the courage to do that. 
Tom doesn't want to go to his work's Christmas party this year. 
You're nothing but a student. 
Tom said that he'd never allow Mary to do that. 
Why do you think that Tom likes baseball so much? 
I'll phone you later. 
Many people believe that isn't going to happen. 
Tom knows that he's not supposed to eat peanuts. 
Tom told me that he was going to try it again. 
I wish you had told me earlier. 
Tom said that he has confidence in Mary. 
Tom thought that he might not need to do that anymore. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be gone by the time we get there. 
I don't think that Tom would allow Mary to do that on her own. 
Don't study! 
I thought that you were still in Australia. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was miserable. 
I'm not sure that Tom and Mary both want to go there. 
I don't think that it'll take very long to do that for you. 
I think that Tom wants me to go with Mary. 
I know that you want to help. 
Both Tom and I stood up at the same time. 
They said they didn't need to hurry. 
I know that you've got more important things to think about. 
I'm not deaf. 
I haven't read all the books. 
Tom never should have been laid off. 
Did you know Tom isn't planning to attend today's meeting? 
I wonder whether Tom has ever asked Mary why she got fired. 
Tom said Mary won't likely have to do that. 
This is the kind of music that I like to listen to. 
She crocheted a jumper for herself. 
I know Tom used to be good at doing that. 
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary she didn't need do that. 
I knew Tom was afraid that the police might arrest him. 
I suspect that Tom didn't visit Australia. 
I thought that it'd take months. 
They thought they could do that for me. 
It's been a long time since we last saw each other. 
I realize Tom could be finished doing that by 2:30. 
I didn't have enough money to buy a present for Tom. 
Tom must've seen something. 
I thought that you said that we weren't going to be here. 
They say that they aren't afraid to do that. 
Mary got pregnant at age fourteen. 
I think that Tom needs to go. 
I've got a ton of work to do. 
I don't think that I'm drunk enough for this. 
They told me they love me. 
Tom said that Mary was going to do that for John. 
I know Tom is finished doing that. 
They say they need to do that. 
The pluviometer is broken. 
You really could have gotten hurt. 
You should have come to the party. 
Tom said that Mary was a good driver. 
They said they had lots of money. 
I promise that I'll come back. 
I wish Tom wouldn't be so noisy. 
She was at the scene of the crime. 
I know Tom knew he shouldn't do that by himself. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be interested. 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't let Mary drive. 
Tom thinks that Mary is a good cook. 
I was afraid I might be recognized. 
Tom says that he's feeling OK. 
I didn't know that Tom was living on Park Street. 
It's a bargain! 
I should have been able to do that for you. 
I know I shouldn't have asked Tom to do that, but I did. 
I wonder whether Tom knew Mary couldn't do that. 
I'll check up on Tom. 
I hope you're good. 
You don't think that Tom suspects anything, do you? 
They told me they'd help. 
He's hard to please. 
Tom and Mary said they were embarrassed. 
I didn't know Tom should do that himself. 
Tom said he suspected Mary would do that. 
Tom will be very suspicious if you do that. 
As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that that's true. 
It isn't urgent. 
Tom knew he'd have to eventually tell Mary the truth. 
Everyone knew Tom didn't like going to Australia. 
Tom didn't pay me as much as he promised that he would. 
I don't think that we'll have any problem with raising the money that we need. 
Tom was sure that Mary was lying. 
I have a high fever. 
Tom said that he doesn't usually lock his car. 
They said they felt responsible. 
The car turned to the left. 
Tom and Mary said that they're only done that once. 
I wonder whether or not Tom has done that yet. 
I'll go change my clothes. 
Tom may still be going to graduate school. 
Tom bought a ticket for Mary. 
Tom asked Mary to turn off the radio. 
Everybody but Tom and Mary knew that they didn't have to stay in Boston. 
I didn't know that you were coming. 
I know Tom is a bit younger than Mary is. 
Someone could have followed us, I suppose. 
Tom's house burned down as well. 
Tom says that he's hoping you can do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they felt like crying. 
I know that you can't do that very well. 
They said they felt foolish. 
I think that Tom did well. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was frustrated. 
I don't think that we should do that until next month. 
Tom said that Mary saw John doing that. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look like her sister. 
Let's buy this cap for Tom. 
I can't remember all my passwords, so I write them all down in a notebook that I keep hidden where I don't think that anybody can find it. 
I'm dying of laughter! 
Tom assumed that everyone in the room knew Mary couldn't understand French. 
I thought Tom was studying French. 
It must've been expensive. 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was desperate to do that. 
I want to know when Tom is planning on doing that. 
Tom said that he wished you knew how to do that. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was unhappy in Boston. 
I thought that you said that Tom was a tailor. 
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary. 
Tom won't hear anybody. 
They said that they were lonely. 
I know that Tom isn't happy there. 
I thought that I was going to get a higher salary. 
Sami isn't the landlord. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still studying French. 
They said they'd do that for free. 
Please promise me you will never tell a lie again. 
Tom told me I had no choice but to do what he said I had to do. 
Why did you tell Tom we're here? 
Tom and Mary have been doing that their entire life. 
Tom and Mary said they weren't afraid. 
Tom gives his kids an allowance. 
Tom and Mary say they were abducted by aliens. 
I didn't know I was supposed to be here by 2:30. 
I wonder if we can do that. 
My mom married my dad in the nineties. 
I think Tom is almost as tall as you. 
Tom didn't have a girlfriend until he was thirty. 
This isn't a mistake. 
I don't think that anyone really expected you to be here. 
Everyone does that. 
I'm very grateful to you for your advice. 
They aren't as tidy as they used to be. 
You know Tom isn't a barber, don't you? 
Tom pulled out a book and started to read it. 
Tom is somebody that I really admire. 
Tom said that Mary was going to win. 
They said they weren't having any fun. 
I know Tom wouldn't be doing that if he didn't have to. 
We should have stayed till the end of the party. 
Tom said that he was very confident. 
You know that that's not possible. 
Where do Tom and Mary plan on staying in Boston? 
I think that Tom will be at home tomorrow. 
Tom said that he probably wouldn't do that again. 
God loves us all. 
I don't think that Tom and I'll see each other again. 
They told us they could help. 
I thought I'd lost my keys. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary had been careless. 
I know that Tom is nuts. 
Tom said he doesn't know what to do. 
Tom told me that he was sick, which wasn't true. 
Tom is sorry that he caused you trouble. 
Tom and Mary took off their socks. 
Tom thinks that Mary will be upset. 
Everybody here knows Tom. 
Tom and Mary say they're going to stop smoking. 
Tom and Mary told the waiter they wanted sit by the window. 
He is back. 
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be safe. 
Tom says he can prove Mary did that. 
I have done that many times. 
Tom and Mary told me they were puzzled. 
Tom and Mary said that they remembered doing that. 
Tom said he doesn't think that Mary ought to do that again. 
It's obvious that Tom isn't used to living on a tight budget. 
I should've reported it to the police, but I didn't. 
I don't think that I'm unapproachable. 
Tom has neither a cat nor a dog. 
I didn't know that Tom knew anyone who did that. 
Tom and Mary know they should do that soon. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary have never done that together. 
I think that Tom is looking for his keys. 
I'm sorry that I said that. 
I think that Tom wouldn't be absent if he knew how important this meeting was. 
Do you think Tom is still committed? 
Tom is going to try to keep Mary from doing that. 
I don't think that I'm going to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was suicidal. 
They said they didn't mind waiting. 
Tom said that he thinks that his parents are going to get divorced. 
I know Tom isn't the one who's supposed to tell Mary she doesn't need to do that. 
I should have told Tom to be quiet. 
My findings suggest that that isn't the case. 
Tom would have gone regardless. 
Tom said he thought that I might need to do that. 
You knew it wasn't the first time that I had done that, didn't you? 
I'll go tell Tom that you're here. 
Donald Trump's a piece of shit. 
Tom thinks if he had tried a little harder, he could've won the race. 
Tom has at least as many books as me. 
Tom said that he was going to ask Mary to do that. 
I don't think that Tom was annoyed. 
I wonder whether Tom is planning on doing that. 
Tom just called and he said he wouldn't be here until 2:30. 
I'm sorry that I didn't notice that you needed help. 
Do most students at your school live in dormitories? 
If you'd asked me for it, I would have given it to you. 
Tom says you deserve a chance. 
Tom said that he's very sure Mary should do that. 
Somebody should've told Tom that he was doing that the wrong way. 
I know Tom knows why I'm planning to do that. 
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't told Mary to do that. 
Tom told me I wasn't going to be fired. 
I'll let you know my decision after I've consulted my lawyer. 
Today the weather's not as good as yesterday. 
I don't think that Tom knows how Mary managed to do that. 
Tom and Mary were told that they couldn't win. 
I know Tom is a showoff. 
I am not accustomed to walking long distances. 
Tom and Mary are planning on leaving at 2:30. 
Whatever you do, don't let Tom know that you're going to do it. 
Tom likes knitting, too. 
Today's your birthday. 
It's good that Tom hasn't done that yet. 
They say they intend to win. 
Tom told Mary that I was tired. 
I don't think that Tom knows that Mary is upset. 
What'll you be doing at this time tomorrow? 
I thought that Tom would make snacks for us. 
They said they didn't feel well today. 
Tom said he thought he'd be able to fix Mary's car. 
I know Tom isn't going to do that either. 
I had no idea that Tom was planning on asking Mary to do that. 
Tom didn't remember he was supposed to do that. 
I know that Tom has already left for Australia. 
I know Tom will be able to do that on his own. 
I want to go to the hospital with Tom. 
I wasn't able to get the door open. 
Tell Tom I'm taking a bath. 
Tom and Mary said they planned on going. 
Tom said that he wanted to be your friend. 
Let me know if something's missing. 
Your opinion doesn't matter. 
Japan is an industrial country. 
Tom assumed he was being followed. 
That's not altogether false. 
Tom said he had to go to the dentist's on October 20th. 
We'll eat lunch together at 12:30. 
Never leave. 
It isn't just Tom's problem. 
I'm sure that both of you will do well. 
That is disgusting. 
We need your help! 
Tom told Mary he had to do that today. 
He's a doctor. 
Tom said he didn't think that he'd ever be able to do that. 
This cell phone is really expensive. 
I wish Tom were my brother. 
Tom and Mary say everybody they know can swim. 
Tom and Mary say that they're not going. 
Tom said that he was somewhat confused. 
Tom showed his room to me. 
It isn't going to be easy for you to do that. 
I don't think that we were seen. 
I'm not the person I used to be. 
I'd rather walk than wait for the next bus. 
Nobody can do that better than Tom. 
Tom said he knew that he might have to do that on Monday. 
Tom and Mary said they were really lonely. 
It's time for you to go to bed. 
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was still a child. 
I know Tom is almost always at home in the evening. 
Did you know it took Tom more than three hours to do that? 
I don't think that we'll be able to win. 
I know Tom doesn't know why I wasn't able do that. 
Tom knows that he shouldn't try doing that by himself. 
If anybody has any questions, I'll be glad to answer them. 
Everybody knows that she married him for his money. 
I've already told Tom that I don't want him to do that. 
Tom and Mary don't think that they'll win. 
She likes cooking for her family. 
I didn't think that what Tom said was accurate. 
Tom said he thought that he might be permitted to do that. 
I didn't know that Tom was that old. 
I thought that Tom might want to go home early. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was nice. 
I don't think I've ever seen anybody do that before. 
Tom said that he wanted to do everything by himself. 
She’s accustomed to rising early. 
Tom said that Mary would likely go to Boston with him. 
Tom and Mary said that they felt cheated. 
If I were you, I would ignore it. 
Tom said he thought I had to do that. 
I know Tom is a little taller than you are. 
Everything is negotiable. 
I didn't think that anyone would disagree with that statement. 
She's at the hotel now. 
He really likes traveling a lot. 
Tom said that he's studying to be a doctor. 
I know I didn't cause this problem. 
Tom says that he has something that he wants me to see. 
I know Tom isn't afraid of anyone. 
They told me they needed space. 
Tom hopes Mary knows that she shouldn't do anything John has asked her to do. 
Since I don't have a job, I can't save money. 
Tom cried all night long. 
I know Tom has never been a construction worker. 
I'll lend this dictionary to you. 
Here's an optical illusion: you think you are looking at a cube, while in fact you are looking at your monitor. 
It's a miracle. 
I don't think that Tom knows who Mary's father is. 
Tom thought that Mary would like to go to Australia to see John. 
One can get accustomed to anything. 
Tom said that he'd also help Mary. 
Tom is a much faster driver than Mary is. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't have insurance. 
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be home on October 20th. 
I know that that won't happen anytime soon. 
I've made us some coffee. 
Tom told me he needed some money. 
I doubt that Tom will agree to that. 
Tom and Mary said that they isn't going to help us. 
Tom told me he forgot all about the meeting. 
I don't think that I can do this again. 
Should I tell Tom that you're not feeling well? 
Come on, tell me. 
Tom said that he knew who did it. 
Tom knows he isn't supposed to do that anymore. 
Tom said that no cars passed him on his way here. 
Tom said he thought Mary was innocent. 
They swore they didn't do that. 
I assumed that you were busy. 
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is planning to do that. 
I know Tom knows that I want to do that. 
Tom is a hustler. 
I am doing my best. 
There's a lot of traffic today. 
I thought that you said you wanted to be the one who did that for Tom. 
You're going to pay for this! 
Tom and Mary didn't know what to say, so they said nothing. 
I thought that you said that you hated that. 
I think Tom isn't a driving instructor anymore. 
Tom shaved his mustache off. 
Tom and Mary told me that they'd been busy. 
Tell Tom I've gone fishing. 
Tom said that his parents have been there. 
I will always have a soft corner in my heart for Tom. 
They told everyone at work they were going to retire. 
Tom doesn't have any idea when Mary wants to do that. 
Tom told me he's better at doing that than Mary. 
You will need a graphic card to play this game. 
Tom and Mary showed their schedules to me. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to be intoxicated. 
I thought that you said you worked here. 
I don't think that you need it. 
Tom said he thought that he might have to do that today. 
I thought that you might like to know. 
Tom and Mary say that they don't study French. 
I knew that Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him. 
I'm convinced that my son is innocent. 
I think Tom may leave on October 20th. 
Tom assumed everyone in the room knew Mary couldn't understand French. 
I can't possibly help you. 
Tom told everyone he was sympathetic. 
I think that Tom will be the last one to do that. 
You complain compulsively. 
Maybe they should've told Tom the truth. 
I think that Tom is expecting someone to make him dinner. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was alone. 
It's pitch black outside. 
I don't think that Tom would care if I did that.

I don't think that Tom knows everybody's name yet. 
I know that Tom cheated. 
Does Tom know that you were born in Australia? 
Everybody I know can speak French. 
Tom says he isn't coming back here. 
Driving is not something I enjoy doing. 
I really doubt Tom would be interested in investing in such a project. 
I doubt Tom is even interested in trying to learn Russian. 
Tom and I are planning on getting divorced. 
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that 
Tom should have been happy. 
Tom wasn't willing to do what we wanted him to do. 
Stop moving. 
Tom said he thought that Mary had agreed to do that. 
They'll be glad they did that. 
I do hope that we can put that behind us and move on. 
If you'd followed my advice, you wouldn't be in such a fix now. 
I promise you that I'll keep you safe. 
Tom is only pretending he isn't interested. 
Tom and Mary said they weren't bored. 
I know that Tom didn't know we were the ones who did that. 
Tom said that Mary was feeling tired. 
I didn't know that you'd be there. 
I know Tom is allowed to do almost anything he wants. 
Tom said that Mary was frightened. 
The only thing that we can do is wait and see what happens. 
Tom said Mary should have walked away. 
I thought that it looked suspicious. 
Tom told me that he'd call me. 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was through doing that. 
Tom and Mary said that they weren't sure what to do. 
I wish that I'd never given Tom any money. 
You should talk faster. 
I promise that I won't bite you. 
Tom said that I didn't sound worried. 
I don't think that you can do this. 
I know all of this is just a game. 
I know Tom didn't know he could do that.

So far, nobody has objected to my doing that.

Tom thought that he needed to do that.

Both Tom and I are to blame. 
I thought you said that you've seen people doing that. 
I didn't know that you did that yesterday. 
Tom thinks Mary won't win. 
It isn't a toy. 
I thought that the bus was free, but I had to pay.

My car can beat yours. 
She promised to give me a phone call. 
Give me her picture. 
I thought that Tom was going to be in Boston last month. 
I pawned my guitar in order to pay the rent. 
Tom and I don't plan to go together. 
He is a nobody. 
It seems that Tom and Mary both like classical music. 
Tom said that he thought he might be permitted to do that today. 
Tom said that Mary didn't have anything she needed to do. 
I hope that I get the chance to ask Tom that question. 
I know Tom won't be as enthusiastic about doing that as you seem to be. 
Tom said that Mary isn't alone. 
I guess you can't do it. 
Tell the truth and shame the devil. 
If you've got a question, please put your hand up. 
They don't think they've ever met you. 
I thought that you'd never arrive. 
Both Tom and I live and work in Boston. 
I didn't know Tom was planning to leave. 
Tom said that he wanted more details. 
Tom may still be there waiting. 
I'm lazy.

Is there any chance that you'll come back to Australia again this year? 
They know they cheated.

Tom said that he'd never seen anything like that before. 
I don't think that Tom would be doing that if he didn't have to. 
Tom knew I was outside. 
They were really annoyed. 
Do you really think that Tom is exhausted? 
He has never hunted. 
Tom said he thought it would be better if Mary didn't do that. 
I also don't think that Tom will do that. 
I don't think that that's such a big problem. 
This isn't my problem. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary need to do that right away. 
I'm really sorry that I told you that. 
Tom is a very good French speaker. 
I thought that you were rude. 
Tom was not born blind. 
Tom and Mary said that they like this time of year. 
Tom told me that he hoped that Mary wouldn't be hesitant to do that. 
I don't think we should stay at the same hotel we stayed at last time. 
I don't think that Tom is conscious. 
Nobody would help us do that. 
I'm about to leave here. 
Tom and Mary said that they knew that how to win. 
Tom said he didn't have an email address. 
Tom thought that it would be a good idea to see a doctor. 
They said they were really curious. 
What is your favourite animal?

I don't think that you're trying very hard to find Tom. 
I handed Tom the letter. 
I know that you're upset. We all are. 
Tom and Mary say that they're feeling kind of tired. 
We know that you lied about Tom. 
The word's origin is unclear. 
You'll regret that. 
I know that I should've helped Tom, but I didn't have the time. 
It seems like Tom and Mary like to do that together. 
I'm not certain that I need to do that. 
I always thought that Tom and Mary were married to each other. 
I wasn't aware Tom wouldn't be there. 
Tom might be absent. 
What's the highest mountain in the world? 
I know Tom didn't know that we wouldn't be able to do that. 
Her bike is blue. 
I'm afraid that that'll happen. 
I thought that you said that you saw Tom doing that. 
I know Tom doesn't know I know how to do that. 
I know Tom won't like the stew Mary made. 
I should have told Tom that I didn't know any French. 
I know Tom doesn't know that I should do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was sympathetic. 
I would have shut my phone off. 
Tom realized doing that wasn't going to be easy. 
I really should have left earlier. 
I don't think that Tom knows what's really going on. 
Tom is a real expert. 
Perhaps you could learn a thing or two from Tom.

Tom said that he's never done that. 
You're stronger than I am. 
The colours are vivid. 
You and I both know Tom needs to do that. 
I'm afraid that I have other plans. 
I tried to persuade Tom to come to Australia with us, but he said that he had other things he had to do. 
Tom might be crying right now.

I don't think that Tom really overdosed. 
Didn't you know that I don't have to do that? 
Tom realized it was going to be hard to do that. 
This time, it'll be different. 
Where there is a will, there is a way. 
You're not supposed to smoke here. 
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to help us. 
I didn't think that anyone could do this.

Is there any possibility that Tom will do that? 
I doubt very seriously Tom will be embarrassed by that. 
I thought that Tom would be in his office.

Tom said that I was very helpful. 
I promise I'll protect you.

Tom says he doesn't think it's possible to do that. 
I don't think that the weather will clear up. 
Asked if he was happy, Tom said that he was. 
I thought that you said you couldn't draw. 
I wonder if I really need that. 
How do we know that's not true? 
Do you like traveling? 
There was no way I could've done that without your help. 
I'm assuming that it was just a coincidence. 
It was clear Tom wouldn't need to do that. 
Tom said that he plans to do that on Monday.

Tom speaks Bangla. 
I suspect that Tom didn't enjoy doing that. 
Drunks and children don't lie. 
Tom doesn't seem to know anything about that.

I doubt Tom would ever do that kind of thing. 
Any idea where Tom might be now? 
That isn't what Tom is going to talk about. 
Tom was just pretending he was tired. 
I don't think I need to tell you what to do.

Tom and Mary said that they thought I was insincere. 
I know Tom is a very good customer. 
I didn't think that Tom would really enjoy playing tennis with Mary. 
Tom knew there was a possibility Mary would show up late. 
I know Tom is a gardener. 
I know Tom didn't know that I could do that. 
I thought someone died. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't told Mary he'd go to Australia with her. 
I usually wash my clothes at a laundrette. 
Fuck you. 
I wasn't surprised Tom couldn't do that. 
Two plus two equals five, for sufficiently large values of two. 
We're concerned about your health. 
I think that Tom has a big advantage. 
Tom wouldn't have helped Mary do that if he'd thought she could have done it by herself. 
Tom and Mary said that they were getting antsy. 
Does Tom not think that he can do that? 
I know Tom isn't a member. 
I would've gone swimming if I'd had the chance to. 
I know Tom doesn't know Mary didn't do that. 
I thought that Tom seemed unconcerned. 
I know Tom knew that he shouldn't be doing that here. 
Tom thought that Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday. 
Please don't turn the lights on. 
We're about to leave here. 
Tom wasn't surprised Mary already knew about what had happened. 
Did Tom know that Mary could do that? 
I suspect that Tom and Mary aren't planning to go to Boston with you. 
I'm fine, and you? 
Tom probably doesn't know he isn't supposed to help Mary do that. 
I don't think that Tom really has time to help. 
Tom said that he didn't know why Mary didn't want to do that. 
You're free to use this car. 
I think that we're going to eventually have to do that. 
Somebody has to tell Tom what happened. 
You have to do that by the end of the week. 
I know Tom would tell you how to do that if you asked him. 
I didn't know Tom was a recovering alcoholic. 
Tom likes to play practical jokes on everybody. 
The fact that Tom did that can't be denied. 
I know that Tom is working late tonight. 
I thought that it was a bad dream. 
Tom said that he was at your house yesterday afternoon. 
Tom said that he wouldn't kiss Mary. 
Tom said he thought that Mary and John were going to break up. 
Tom said that he's glad Mary did that. 
Tom thinks Mary and I can take care of ourselves. 
Tom and Mary don't know when John is planning on doing that. 
I know that Tom will leave for Australia soon. 
He is studying. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary could do that better than he could. 
Is there any chance you'll be coming to Boston this year? 
Tom and Mary told me that they had to walk home. 
I hope you know the last thing that I want to do is go there without your permission. 
Don't make promises that you can't keep. 
I thought that I had a month to finish this. 
I think that Tom might've been the one who did this. 
I won't permit it. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't confess. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was good-looking. 
I wonder if Tom really could help me. 
I admitted that I did what Tom asked me not to do. 
We're still hoping that Tom will get better. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary is doing today. 
Tom didn't know he was expected to do that. 
Tom said that Mary was optimistic. 
Tom told me he thinks Mary is prettier than Alice. 
Tom is going to be very embarrassed if you do that. 
Maybe the only one here who can do that is Tom. 
I thought that Tom wouldn't be able to do that for us. 
Does Tom think that he'll stay in Australia long? 
I assume that you haven't heard from Tom. 
Tom says there were no teachers there. 
I thought that Tom might not be permitted to do that by himself. 
I know Tom wasn't ready to do that. 
I think that Tom has the hots for you. 
I wonder if Tom really could help us. 
I'm not smart, but at least I'm smart enough to know it. 
Tom said that Mary should've stayed in Boston longer. 
I wish you would have stayed home. 
Tom said that he'd definitely win. 
I thought that I was just lucky. 
Tom said that he isn't even going to try to win. 
May I open my eyes now? 
Tom said that Mary walked home. 
Tom said that he didn't think that we should even consider doing that. 
Tom said that he doesn't want to spend time in jail. 
I'm afraid that you have to work overtime. 
Tom said he thinks that he can take care of himself. 
Goodbye. I'll see you at the time we agreed on. 
I don't think that I really need to read this right now. 
I think that Tom is adaptable. 
Tom said that he didn't think that he'd be able to do that without any help. 
I wonder if Tom can swim as well as Mary can. 
I know Tom doesn't need to do that anymore. 
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that here. 
Tom and Mary told me they got here early today. 
I do not want to work. 
I thought Tom and Mary were planning on staying for a month. 
Tom said he wished Mary and I'd behave ourselves. 
They said they did that three times. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look like a teacher. 
I know Tom knows that Mary shouldn't do that. 
I know Tom is a smart guy. 
Tom and Mary think I don't know what they did. 
Almost no one knows we're brothers. 
They said they felt uneasy. 
I don't think that anybody really thought that Tom was busy. 
Tom thought that Mary was going to let him go home early. 
I heard that Tom and Mary have both been fired. 
The show's Monday. 
Tom said he could have done that alone. 
I'd never do such a thing. 
I think that we should leave now. 
Tom said that he liked Mary. 
Tom said he thought that I might win. 
Tom said that he thought I ought to do that. 
The family likes to watch murder mysteries. 
I know Tom knew I was the one who had done that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was taking piano lessons. 
Tom still plans on going. 
Tom thought that Mary might be allowed to do that. 
I don't think that it's worth the price that they're asking. 
Tom said he isn't sleepy yet. 
Tom said he thought that he'd be able to do that for me. 
I thought that Tom wasn't afraid of anyone. 
What denominations would you like that in? 
I wonder if Tom wants to buy a car. 
Tom said he thought that you'd win. 
I figured that I might be able to help. 
I already knew that Tom couldn't do that. 
Tom says that he'll do that when he's in Australia. 
Tom says that Mary is willing to do that for us. 
Someone else must have seen what happened, too. 
Tom believed that that was going to happen. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was mistaken. 
I'm afraid that Tom may have lost his way. 
Did you know that Tom was going to do that? 
I wonder whether or not we'll ever find out what happened. 
I was just about to give you a bell, but you've beaten me to it. 
Tom wouldn't let Mary help him. 
I was kind of surprised Tom said he wouldn't do that that. 
I think that Tom and Mary are Canadians. 
I could not sleep because of the heat. 
Are you sure this'll work? 
Germans have no sense of humor? I don't find that funny. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd probably do that. 
You should put this phrase in parentheses. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still awake. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might need to do that this evening. 
Things don't always happen the way we expect to happen. 
Tom and Mary told me that they forgot something. 
They said that was their favorite store. 
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on October 20th. 
Do you think you can sing for us? 
I don't think that it's weird at all. 
It was clear Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that. 
I think that they'll have a chance. 
Tom is planning on leaving at 2:30. 
This is a historic moment. 
Everybody here except you has done that. 
I want you to know that I appreciate your help. 
I know Tom isn't able to play the bassoon very well. 
You're a bit younger than Tom is, aren't you? 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't left the windows open. 
Tom would probably have done something about that if he could have. 
I am right. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't angry. 
Tom said that he likes pizza the way Mary makes it. 
I'm pretty certain that I can do that. 
A ball hit her right leg. 
I thought that Tom said something else. 
It isn't something that I want to discuss. 
I think that Tom is ready. 
The game was postponed until next week. 
You're dead. 
So does this restaurant have pulao? 
Tom and Mary are planning to go tomorrow, aren't they? 
Don't go near that! 
Tom told me that he wasn't planning on doing that. 
I think that Tom is discontented. 
I should have said no. 
You know we don't have much time right now. 
I don't think Tom likes anyone. 
The United States dominated the world after World War Two. 
Tom and Mary don't know where John is planning on going. 
The temperature in Boston is expected to drop to -22°C. 
Could you please take me home? 
Tom told me that he thought he might win. 
I believe I've seen the document you're talking about. 
I know Tom might get in trouble if he does that. 
Go to bed. 
Tom called Mary and told her he needed to stay in Boston for another three days. 
Tom said that he couldn't remember where he'd put his keys. 
I don't think that it's as important as Tom thinks it is. 
I think that Tom wants something to write on. 
I thought that there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom isn't someone you can replace easily. 
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying. 
Tom would have done that if he'd known he was supposed to. 
I wonder what could have made Tom change his mind. 
I know Tom didn't know who did that for him. 
Tom and Mary said they weren't able to do that. 
I hope Tom gets the help he needs. 
We must have taken the wrong road. 
Tom didn't want any of his friends to know he was a drug dealer. 
I knew Tom was going to want to do that. 
I've been struck by lightning twice. 
I think you could have done this by yourself. 
Tom said that he didn't want to study French. 
I swear I didn't know Tom would do that. 
I wonder if Tom really wanted to go to Boston with us. 
I think that I'll go to Australia next year. 
I thought that you knew Tom couldn't speak French. 
I'm a bit hungry. 
I thought that you said that Tom did that. 
I don't think that anyone knows yet. 
They put on their hats and left. 
Who would be so stupid as to do that? 
Tom didn't tell Mary he wasn't happy. 
You knew Tom told everybody he was going to do that, didn't you? 
Tom realized I didn't need to do that. 
What's one thing you really like to do? 
Didn't you know that there was a good chance this would happen? 
Tom said doing that might cause problems. 
They said they need to get more sleep. 
The accident caused traffic chaos. 
Tom said that he cried every day. 
Tom thinks that he can save the world. 
I know Tom knows that he shouldn't be doing that here. 
Tom was a little overweight when he was a child. 
Tom thought that Mary lived in Australia. 
I don't think that Tom will be doing that by himself. 
Tom said that he didn't know Mary wasn't able to speak French very well. 
Tom didn't like the song Mary sang. 
Tom thinks that if he had tried a little harder, he could've won the race. 
They said they weren't sad. 
Tom thinks that I need to eat more vegetables. 
Tom thinks that you can do it. 
She lives an ascetic lifestyle. 
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy going to Australia with me. 
Tom's wrong. 
Tom said Mary thought that she might not be allowed to do that by herself. 
Tom told me that he first met Mary in Boston when he was a teenager. 
I don't think that it'll be possible to do that without some help. 
I know Tom would like to know if you aren't planning to do that. 
I doubt that Tom will stick around. 
They say they're too old to start over. 
The store is closed on Mondays. 
I know Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle. 
I don't want to make a mistake. 
Tom and Mary said that they heard the gunshots. 
Let's make believe we're cowboys. 
I don't think that I want to go there anymore. 
Tom said he hopes that you won't eat the last piece of cake. 
I think that Tom is the one who's supposed to do that. 
I should have paid in advance. 
We're going to go to the airport. 
I doubted Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that. 
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine. 
I didn't think that anyone else had noticed. 
That cat is so cute. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't that I wasn't going to do that. 
I know Tom is a mechanic. 
Jack of all trades, master of none. 
I wonder whether Tom is satisfied. 
I know you still want to be with me. 
Tom told me he was unemployed. 
I didn't know you could understand French. 
I doubt you'll be happy with my report. 
I should've known Tom would do that. 
Tom told me that he used to live in Australia. 
I'm glad you succeeded. 
It'll take at least an hour to get there. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't pass the exam. 
You may use my desk if you want to. 
I think that Tom would agree with me. 
Don't stay too long. 
I know that Tom is popular. 
That makes sense. 
Tom said that he really did do that without anyone's help. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is prepared to do that. 
I don't think that Tom would care if you did that today. 
I know Tom used to be a speech coach. 
He can't swim a mile. 
Tom said that he probably isn't going to do that. 
Tom said that Mary was upset. 
I don't think Tom is a good lawyer. 
Tom will have to figure it out. 
Are you absolutely sure that Tom has to do that? 
They said they hope it'll happen soon. 
Tom said he isn't being used. 
I thought that I had nothing to lose. 
By daybreak, the storm was over. 
Nobody I know really wants to do that. 
I think Tom is expecting somebody to make dinner for him. 
They said they don't want to do that. 
The price of gasoline is so high that we can't buy a big car. 
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already? 
Tom told me that he hoped that Mary would be discreet. 
"Thanks." "For what?" "For everything." 
You're a teacher. 
Different strokes for different folks. 
Anything's possible. 
Tom and Mary told me they were displeased. 
Tom and Mary say that they need to do that. 
Let's hope that that never happens again. 
I don't think that that actually happened. 
Tom said that Mary has been arrested before. 
Tom said that Mary isn't ready. 
I don't think that Tom knows everybody's name. 
Tom had trouble admitting that he was wrong. 
I thought that you might want to play a game of chess. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be impressed. 
I know that it's highly unlikely that anybody knows me. 
Tom said that he wasn't sure he could do it. 
Are you going to be okay? 
They told me they were famished. 
I thought that something was seriously wrong with Tom. 
Tom said that he isn't sleepy yet. 
Tom assumed everybody knew Mary was going to do that. 
I know Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore. 
I had no idea that Tom could do that. 
It looks like Tom is waiting for somebody. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was probably having a good time in Boston. 
You broke the computer. Nice going, Einstein. 
I'm afraid that you'll get lost. 
They say they like studying French. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is. 
I knew Tom was ready to do that. 
I suspect that Tom will probably do that. 
Tom said that he was going to stay up all night long. 
I didn't know Tom was a veteran. 
I thought that this was what you wanted me to buy. 
As a child, my daughter had frequent asthma attacks. 
I knew Tom didn't know that you were the one who had done that. 
We've already met everyone. 
Tom said that there were still a lot things left to do. 
You haven't got a chance. 
If Tom had had enough money, he would've gone to Boston with Mary. 
Tom told everyone that he was glad that was going to happen. 
You're always doubting my word. 
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do. 
There's a good chance we'll win. 
Tom says he knows that Mary can win. 
I know Tom isn't a baseball fan. 
I knew that Tom would ask Mary to do that. 
I think that Tom shouldn't agree to do that. 
I don't think that Tom has sold anything all day. 
I think I'm too old for her. 
I don't think I should have left early. 
I didn't say that I was going to Australia. 
Tom should have stayed in Boston a few more days. 
I should have told Tom sooner. 
Tom and Mary said they didn't like doing that. 
Tom will remember. 
It's not something that I think I can do. 
Tom told me where he was planning on staying. 
I know that you're not planning on staying in Australia. 
I know that Tom was impolite. 
Do you have a pencil that I can borrow? 
Tom wanted to do that as well. 
I could have done that for you. 
I think that Tom is home. 
It is agonizing for the united States to lose our young men and women. 
Tom ought to do everything they tell him. 
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia. 
What is the most beautiful place in the world? 
The storm caused a lot of damage to the crop. 
I don't think that everyone has given up. 
Let's have a picture taken. 
I knew that it wouldn't be easy. 
All of sudden all the lights went out. 
Tom and Mary said that they'll probably win. 
I think that Tom would be annoyed if you did that. 
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs. 
Tom said that I shouldn't leave early. 
I know that I should stay and help. 
Don't look at me! 
I suspect that Tom and Mary were planning on doing that tomorrow. 
I didn't know that you knew how to drive a bus. 
I'm not sure that I want to be doing this. 
I know Tom does that well. 
Tom said that nothing had changed. 
That's not one of my priorities. 
It isn't something I can decide quickly. 
I'm sorry that I couldn't make it to your party last night. 
I know Tom knows I needed to do that. 
Stay out of this! 
I know Tom is afraid that he'll get fired. 
If I were you, I'd call a doctor. 
I wasn't feeling very hungry. 
I've done everything you've asked. 
Do you have a tie that I could borrow? 
I didn't think that we'd find anybody who could do that for us. 
Tom is not an angel. 
I think that Tom is mad. 
That sounds awesome! 
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something. 
Tom said he thought that Mary would wait. 
Tom said he didn't think that the smell bothered Mary. 
Tom said that he's willing to do that for us. 
Can you believe Tom is still just thirteen? 
Tom sent his picture to Mary. 
Tom already knows Mary doesn't plan to be here today. 
They say they've never eaten Thai food. 
I think that both Tom and Mary have never been to Boston. 
They're playing chess. 
I thought I heard somebody singing. 
I heard that Tom plans to move to Australia. 
It's not as hot here as I expected it to be. 
They don't think they'll do that. 
I don't think that I belong here. 
Nobody saw Tom leave. 
I knew that Tom used to live in Boston. 
Tom ran back home to get something he forgot. 
Tom told me that he might win. 
Tom didn't have any problems with Mary. 
I thought that Tom refused to do that. 
How do you know that you aren't mistaking me for someone else? 
You should have refused to stay in Boston. 
Nobody can save you. 
I'm glad that I didn't do that. 
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom he's wrong. 
Tom said that he didn't want to live in Boston anymore. 
Tom never should've been let out prison. 
His train arrives at the main station at ten to six. 
They said they couldn't wait. 
Tom said Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself. 
I know what I'd do. 
He didn't need to bring an umbrella. 
Both Tom and Mary weren't at home when we went to visit them. 
Tom thinks that I need to do that today. 
Tom admitted that he didn't do what we asked him to do. 
It's a pity we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity. 
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon. 
Tom and I didn't know we were the ones who were supposed to do that. 
I'm so tired I can hardly walk. 
They felt they needed to do something. 
I read many foreign languages, but I don't speak any. 
You sprung a trap. 
I should have added more salt. 
I know that isn't what you want. 
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married. 
I think that Tom is smashed. 
Tom and Mary say that they'll never do that. 
I think that Tom is sorry. 
You were skinny the first time that I met you. 
I think that Tom could've gotten home by himself. 
Tom and Mary both know who you are. 
Mary said she doesn't plan to do that by herself. 
It isn't supposed to be fun. 
They said that they were unimpressed. 
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do yet. 
I know that you probably didn't need to do that. 
I wonder whether or not Tom still remembers where we first met. 
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would've been avoided. 
Tom said he'd expected Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th. 
Tom said that he thought that he might be required to do that again. 
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't swim. 
I knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that. 
Tom said that he had to leave early. 
They realize they're being ignored. 
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have gotten here by now. 
Tom and Mary said that they would do it. 
There's no doubt that Tom used to live in Australia. 
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for three more days. 
Tom said he thought that I seemed unconcerned. 
I should have stayed and helped Tom. 
Tom said he thought that I'd be able to do that. 
I figured that Tom would panic. 
Tom thinks that he's the best swimmer here. 
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is pleased. 
I'm frying fish. 
The wind died down by the evening. 
Tom said that he thought it might be dangerous to do that. 
Slow down! 
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it. 
I know Tom could do that if he really needed to. 
We will never know. 
Tom admitted he had killed Mary. 
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working? 
They think they're in love. 
Tom and Mary think that they can do that. 
Tom is never going to hurt anybody again. 
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly. 
You're not going to get in trouble for helping me, are you? 
I've heard women spend more on shoes than men do. 
I think that Tom will be excited. 
We'll be landing in fifteen minutes. 
Tom said that he would take care of Mary. 
Tom's parents allow him to do anything he wants. 
I thought that you were going to fix that. 
I hope that I never have to do that. 
Tom has already been told he isn't going to be allowed to do that. 
They say they're unsure. 
I know that Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that. 
Tom should've told me earlier. 
I need to go to the toilet. 
Both men apologized to each other. 
You're not doing anything wrong, are you? 
Tom said that Mary doesn't think John will actually do that. 
They say they also need to do that. 
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that. 
They told me they'd help me. 
I don't think that I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house. 
Don't you think that we have a chance to win? 
They said they wouldn't speak French. 
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games. 
Tom and Mary say they don't think that they snore. 
I knew that Tom was active in his church. 
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well. 
Tom said that he'd found something. 
A business isn't a charity. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia. 
I don't think Tom is as good-looking as John is. 
Tom said he thought prices at that store were too high. 
I don't think that anybody disputes that. 
Tom and Mary said that they couldn't recall. 
Tom said that he hoped that he'd be able to do that today. 
You knew everybody at the party, didn't you? 
Tom said that Mary was unafraid. 
I'm sorry that it happened like this. 
I know Tom isn't afraid to walk through the woods alone. 
Tom and I are both angry. 
I don't think that Tom will be able to do that without some help. 
It is hot. 
Tom told me that he didn't want to live in Boston. 
No one asked me if I liked it or not. 
Many old people these days cannot keep up with the times. 
Tom hoped that he wouldn't be blamed for the problem. 
I know Tom appreciated that. 
Tom told me that he'd decided to do that. 
It's a kind of cat. 
Tom thought that Mary would probably refuse to do that. 
I'm sure that you will succeed. 
Tom denied he had accepted the bribe. 
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea. 
I admit that I didn't do what Tom said I had to do. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was broke. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was miserable. 
Can't this wait until tomorrow? 
We'll be landing in 15 minutes. 
We know that that won't happen anymore. 
They said they were really sorry. 
Tom loudly cleared his throat. 
I think that Tom is unprejudiced. 
I'm afraid that I've lost it. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to be grumpy. 
We are both adults. 
They aren't as weak as they used to be. 
I know Tom was supposed to do that. 
Tom said he thought I should do that today. 
Don't talk about business while we're eating. 
I don't think that I need to help Tom do that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was tough. 
I hope that Tom gets adopted by a good family. 
Tom said he thought that you knew Mary. 
She needs to be taken to hospital. 
I would have helped you if you had asked. 
OK. 
Tom said that he thought that I was wearing a wig. 
This isn't a drill. 
Tom should have done that a long time ago. 
I think that Tom slept all afternoon. 
I wonder whether Tom is upset or not. 
Tom said he knew that they might not let him do that at school. 
Tom said that he hopes that Mary likes doing that. 
Tom would have done that for Mary if he'd had more time. 
I don't think that you really need to do that. 
Something's still not right. 
Have you lost your reason? 
I thought that Tom liked riddles. 
I know Tom isn't planning to go to Boston with you. 
Tom said he isn't sure that Mary has to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that. 
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan on staying in Boston until October? 
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourselves. 
Tom said that he thought that doing that would be fun. 
I think you'll discover that it was Tom's fault. 
I thought that it was rather ingenious. 
Do you know whether Tom and Mary are going to do that? 
What makes you think that Tom and Mary were the ones who did that? 
Do you still plan to do that with Tom? 
Tom said that he didn't feel safe. 
His younger sister is a well-known TV star. 
I know what time you said you'd get there, but I couldn't get there then. 
I don't think that they're complaining. 
You and I both know that that isn't true. 
Let's assume that that'll happen. 
Tom told everybody he didn't know what to do. 
Tom needed somebody he could trust. 
I want to hear a story! 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was being truthful. 
It's quite likely Tom will come. 
I doubt that Tom will come to Boston this year. 
I didn't think anyone had tried that before. 
You should have made better use of your time. 
They say that they aren't planning on going. 
Tom said that it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that. 
I am learning Old English. 
I want the rest of the money that you owe me. 
Tom said that Mary could've done that alone. 
I hope that more people will be here. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was difficult to get along with. 
They said that they were very drunk. 
You could have told me earlier. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was conceited. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are skeptical. 
I know Tom never does that anymore. 
Tom says he only swears when it is absolutely necessary. 
I don't think that Tom is high. 
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was interested in basketball. 
Tom told me that he thought that this book was interesting. 
Tom assumed everybody knew he couldn't do that. 
Tom said he planned on going on October 20th. 
They said they're doing just fine. 
Hostilities between the two powers resumed. 
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did. 
I'd have done that if I could have. 
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning to do that. 
Tom assumed everyone at school knew that he'd been arrested. 
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy. 
Tom said that he's seen Mary do that. 
Tom and Mary said they needed the money. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was going to be able to do that. 
I think that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that. 
Everybody knows that Tom can't speak French very well. 
My findings suggest that isn't the case. 
Tom found the watch that he had lost. 
I know nothing about Boston. 
Tom said that he thought that it might be dangerous to do that. 
Someone must have left the window open. 
I know Tom is a messy person. 
I'm sorry, sir. There must've been some mistake. 
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that. 
Tom was only stating the obvious. 
Tom said that he wasn't offered a job. 
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy. 
Tom said that he would be able to do that in a few hours. 
Nobody doubts you'll be able to pass the examination. 
Where's everybody? 
How've you been feeling? 
Fortune favours the bold. 
They're not sure they can do that again. 
I thought that Tom was doing that. 
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are still staring at me. 
I thought that Tom had heard us. 
It isn't compulsory. 
I hope nobody comes. 
What colour was Tom wearing? 
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anybody else to do it for them. 
Tom said that he'd walk Mary home. 
It'll be difficult for Tom to win. 
We should have hired someone more qualified. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was unimpressed. 
I wonder if Tom knows that he's overweight. 
Tom said that he didn't know why Mary went to Australia. 
Tom told me he was too tired to study. 
Where is your luggage? 
Both of my parents are musicians. 
I live in Groningen city. 
How do we know that's not true? 
Tom said he didn't want to die. 
That's the car that I want to buy. 
Tom said he thought that Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow. 
I know that Tom is chubby. 
Is tomorrow going to be dry? 
I'm not sure that Tom is going to be willing to talk to me. 
Tom said that he's glad Mary was able to win. 
I didn't think that you'd be able to get Tom to do that. 
It's not raining. 
I cannot speak English, much less German. 
Tom thought that something bad would happen. 
I thought that's what you would have wanted. 
I know it's highly unlikely anyone knows me. 
Where is Tom now? 
Tom said that Mary went to a divorce lawyer. 
They said they knew they could win. 
I doubt that Tom will be reasonable. 
Both Tom and I enjoy playing volleyball. 
It isn't likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong. 
Tom said that he was unable to win. 
Tom said that he thought that he might not have to do that. 
Tom said that he couldn't do that anytime soon. 
There's a possibility that Tom won't want to go to Boston with us. 
It isn't enough to know only one language. 
She's a blonde girl. 
Tom thinks we can't do that. 
I know Tom is a better tennis player than me. 
Tom said that he isn't mad. 
Tom might've done the same thing that Mary did. 
I know Tom is a sophomore. 
Tom definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was interested. 
I thought that you were planning to be here early. 
Tom said that Mary knew that John might not have to do that until Monday. 
Tom shouldn't have ever tried to do that by himself. 
How is your father? 
My son isn't a snob. 
I would have let Tom do it. 
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected. 
I don't think that they're bad people. 
They said they didn't want me to wait. 
No one suspected. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone. 
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow. 
Is this the first time that you've experienced this kind of pain? 
Tom said Mary knew that she might not have to do that again. 
They swore they wouldn't do that again. 
I don't really plan on doing that. 
I know Tom will allow you to do that. 
Tom said Mary would do that. 
They've said they won't do that. 
Tom thinks that Mary won't do that for John. 
Tom said he thought that there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom would like it. 
You aren't the only one Tom asked. 
Tom thought that Mary wasn't finished doing that yet. 
They put away their notebooks. 
Tom and Mary said that they felt uncomfortable. 
I didn't know Tom could actually do that. 
I didn't say that I used to live in Australia. 
Tom said that he knew why Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary. 
I know that Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would. 
Tom said he thought that Mary was over thirty. 
We went up two floors to reach the apparel stalls. 
I don't think that Tom is funny. 
Tom thinks that he's going to die soon. 
I thought that Tom was sick. 
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that. 
They said they'd be happy to help. 
Both Tom and I want to go. 
I didn't know that you'd tell me. 
Tom and Mary said they were jealous. 
I thought that I'd be able to do that for Tom. 
Tom promised he'd never again make such a mistake. 
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this? 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was fat. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary still wanted to go to Australia. 
Don't make such a big deal out of small things. 
I don't think anyone can help me now. 
Tom said that it's a very common problem. 
Are you sure this will work? 
I'm afraid that I'll be tied up all afternoon. 
I know you can hear me. 
You didn't to be willing to do that. 
Tom told Mary he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought. 
The doctor isn't available now. 
Soccer players make a lot of money. 
Tom is a first-time offender. 
I promise you won't happen. 
Tom said that Mary thought that he might need to do that. 
Tom said that he wouldn't ever try to do that again. 
I don't think that it ever worked. 
Don't forget to take your medication. 
You don't know how difficult it was for Tom. 
Tom has given lots of things to me. 
I know Tom is a few years older than Mary. 
I wonder if Tom likes doing that. 
I know Tom can't do that without some help. 
Tom admitted he lied to me. 
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan to stay at home all day. 
Tom doesn't know that I still have this. 
We aren't quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing. 
Both of us love Tom. 
Tom said that he hopes that you try your best to do that. 
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everybody else wanted to do. 
Tom said that Mary knew that she might be permitted to do that this evening. 
I don't think that I know the man playing the drums. 
This old man has age spots on his skin. 
Tom and Mary vowed that they'd never do that. 
Give that candle to me. 
Tom seemed to be unaware of what he needed to do. 
There is no time to explain. 
Tom didn't realize that he had to leave. 
They said that they were afraid. 
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats. 
I graduated from the University of Kyoto. 
You're comparing apples and oranges. 
Tom said that there was still a lot of work to do. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was embarrassed. 
Tom said that he thought he'd be arrested. 
Tom and Mary told me that they were worn out. 
I've heard the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia. 
Tom said that he didn't want to see Mary anymore. 
They're living in lala-land. 
They said they thought I'm charming. 
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital. 
I don't think that you'll have much fun doing that. 
I suspect that Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to. 
I was surprised Tom didn't know how to do that. 
I plan on skipping lunch. 
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was afraid. 
Tom has already told me he's decided to go Boston next summer. 
That does not make sense. 
They say they're dying. 
Tom offered to lend some money to me. 
Do you think Tom would allow me to do that? 
Tom had no idea Mary didn't know what she was doing. 
Tom told everybody he needed to do that. 
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker. 
They said they weren't planning to go. 
They say they've taught French. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are curious. 
I know that Tom knows I don't need to do that. 
You must help Tom. 
Tom told us he had a headache. 
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would've exploded. 
Tom and Mary told me that they'd win, but they didn't. 
I'm glad to hear it. 
Tom and Mary say that they don't know any French. 
I don't think that we'll find anyone who can help us do that. 
You should have refused to go to Boston. 
I thought that you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary. 
Tom said that isn't the main reason Mary should do that. 
Tom doesn't have a car and Mary doesn't either. 
I am a cat. 
I know that you don't do that anymore. 
Tom said that he was no different. 
Tom admitted that what he said was wrong. 
Tom could have been afraid. 
Who do you think asked me to give you this? 
I've just vomited. 
I hope that I get a raise. 
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that. 
Tom said that he would have come if we'd invited him. 
I don't think that I'll likely do that. 
Tom said that he might cry. 
It's Sunday. 
Tom told me that he wasn't tired. 
I didn't think that anyone really thought Tom was busy. 
I think you know that we have to do that today. 
I didn't think that Tom would actually do that. 
I knew that Tom would leave early. 
Tom said he thought that Mary understood French. 
Tom said that he needed my help, so I helped him. 
I don't think that anyone's lived in this house in a long time. 
Tom denied that he stole the money. 
Tom said he hasn't decided what he'll do yet. 
Everybody knew that Tom didn't like going to Boston. 
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day. 
Tom's obviously drunk. 
I'm absolutely certain that's not going to happen. 
Everybody was there except Tom. 
I thought that you had promised to give that to Tom. 
I thought that you said you saw Tom this morning. 
I think that Tom was supposed to be here. 
Tom and Mary said that they had fully recovered. 
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that by yourself. 
I don't think that there's any way out of here. 
Every rose has its thorn. 
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French. 
You know that I wouldn't do that. 
I think we all know that's a bad idea. 
I thought that Tom knew what Mary had to do. 
Tom was probably about thirteen at the time. 
Tom and Mary said they were ticklish. 
Tom said that he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today. 
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here. 
Tom said that he thought that he was the only one who wanted to do that. 
I'm not sure that Tom would let me do that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was mean. 
So where's the problem? 
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful. 
He'll have to do this task again. 
I know Tom didn't know anyone who was able to do that. 
Only fresh vegetables are sold here. 
I believe this isn't a good idea. 
Tom has been asked not to do that already. 
Here's your change. 
That portrait reminds me of someone that I knew a long time ago. 
When was the last time that you asked someone for help? 
I'm sure that Tom doesn't hate Mary. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was skinny. 
I know Tom is irritated. 
I didn't meet anybody new today. 
This lake is the deepest lake in Japan. 
I knew that Tom was planning to do that. 
Both Tom and I don't speak French. 
I thought that you'd be ready. 
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom was glad that had happened. 
They said that they were very tired. 
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you? 
I don't think that there's any harm in telling you now. 
I thought you said that you did that on Monday. 
Everybody here knows Tom is in Boston. 
Tom denied that he met Mary last week. 
That isn't why I'm here. 
Austria is a parliamentary republic in central Europe and consists of nine federal states. 
Tom and Mary are looking for somebody to help them build a wall. 
They said they isn't thirty yet. 
I didn't think that Tom really needed to do that yesterday. 
I thought that Tom was already back. 
Tom said that Mary knew she might not be permitted to do that unless John does it with her. 
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary wouldn't want to do that. 
I thought that Mary was cute. 
Tom thinks that Mary won't be able to do that by herself. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was happy. 
Did Tom say that he stayed in Australia? 
Tom said that he'd pay for everything. 
They told me they weren't alone. 
I don't think I can finish the job alone. 
Tom said that Mary isn't safe. 
Tom said that I looked thinner than the last time he saw me. 
They said they'd see me tomorrow. 
Tom said that Mary was concerned. 
I'm afraid that Tom won't let me go. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary is going to do this afternoon. 
Tom paid somebody to do that. 
I thought that Tom would be cooperative. 
Tom told me he was safe. 
Tom said that I should go to Boston with you. 
They think they know what to do. 
Tom thinks that Mary will be scared. 
Both Tom and I are very proud of you. 
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to. 
We can't pretend that Tom is normal. 
Tom is amused. 
Tom should never have tried to do that on his own. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd never ever do that. 
I'm taller than he is. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was conservative. 
Tom said that he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today. 
The teachers' room and the gym are being renovated. 
Do you think there's any chance that you'll be able to do that? 
Tom set his glass down. 
You'd think that would've impressed Tom. 
This is the first time that I've bought a newspaper in this city. 
It's a good question. 
Without water, we can't exist. 
Tom certainly understands we all need to attend today's meeting. 
Tom and Mary say that they didn't agree to do that. 
I know Tom will be able to help us do that. 
I ate lunch three hours ago. 
Tom said that he appreciated Mary's help. 
I knew that Tom would forgive me. 
You're the only one who can protect them. 
Can somebody explain this to me? 
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week? 
Tom and Mary told me that they wanted a dog. 
Everyone knows Tom and Mary like each other. 
I know Tom didn't know that I wasn't going to do that. 
Tom said that he thought he might not have to do that by himself. 
Tom has lots of things he needs to do. 
Tom and Mary say that they aren't sure they're ready. 
There's no logical reason for this. 
I suspected that Tom was intoxicated. 
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary enjoyed doing that. 
They said that they were feeling fine. 
I wish you hadn't seen me doing that. 
Tom and Mary said that they had no money. 
I don't think that I need to tell Tom to do that. 
Tom should never have gotten that job. 
Tom told Mary she was his one and only. 
Tom knew that he wouldn't be expelled. 
Tom was convinced Mary didn't want to do that. 
Tom said that he knew that was what Mary had to do. 
I think that you're terrific. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is going to Boston next week. 
Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her. 
I know Tom doesn't want to do that. 
You are not an idiot! 
I think that Tom doesn't win very often when he plays chess. 
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well. 
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race. 
I know that Tom came to Australia last week. 
Tom said Mary wasn't angry. 
I think we've bought everything we need. 
Tom said that he thought that he might not need to do that by himself. 
Tom is hiding something, and Mary knows it. 
I think that Tom is average. 
You aren't just working for Tom. 
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself. 
I don't think that Tom knows how it happened. 
It's not a watch. 
Tom and Mary said that they're unafraid. 
I'm from the United States of America. 
I don't think that Tom knows how to have a good time. 
I know that you don't want to hurt me. 
Tom doesn't seem to be willing to correct his mistakes. 
I loved that book. 
Tom said that Mary wouldn't like doing that. 
Tom said that he felt safe. 
Tom's homesick. 
Did you know that that would happen? 
I think that Tom believed me. 
I don't think that we can do that by 2:30. 
Tom thinks that Mary would probably not do that. 
I thought that you said that we weren't going to do that anymore. 
I know Tom doesn't know anybody who's able to do that. 
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend. 
I thought that you might be the only person who would listen to me. 
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be nervous doing that. 
That's the guitar that I want to buy. 
I think that Tom did it. 
See you tomorrow morning. 
They told me they were ambidextrous. 
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that. 
I really thought that Tom would change his mind. 
Tom would've missed the train if he'd stopped to buy a chocolate bar. 
I doubt very seriously Tom will be excited about that. 
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that. 
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right. 
Tom said that he didn't need any more help. 
We can't make a change in our schedule. 
I was shocked when I heard Tom had been arrested. 
Tom and Mary probably don't know they aren't supposed to park there. 
I thought that you could use a friend. 
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you? 
They said they'd be willing help us. 
Tom told me he'd done that. 
Tom isn't the same as he was thirty years ago. 
I don't think that there's any point in discussing this today. 
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary that she needs to do that today. 
The United States' Civil War lasted four years. 
They say they're disappointed. 
It isn't always easy to distinguish good from evil. 
Tom said that he's going to try something he has never done before. 
I don't think that Tom is strong. 
It isn't too hard. 
Tom said that you didn't want to go to Boston with us. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are suspicious. 
You are a prude. 
Tom said that he would've done that if he could've. 
I don't think anyone really wants to do that. 
Tom said that he wished that he'd kissed Mary goodnight. 
If you do that, so will I. 
I think that Tom is irreplaceable. 
They told me they're tempted to do that. 
I don't think that I have everything I need. 
That isn't what Tom wanted you to do. 
Which book did you give Tom? 
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last year. 
Tom and Mary say they're hoping that can do that. 
I know Tom expected me to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom has ever been to Boston. 
It isn't quite finished. 
Tom said that he felt frustrated. 
I know Tom will be doing that with Mary. 
I sent some roses to Mary. 
Tom said Mary was taller than her sister. 
I wasn't as hungry as Tom was. 
Will you lend your dictionary to me? 
I buy things that I know that I'm not going to use. 
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone. 
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful. 
How're you doing today? 
Tom said that Mary wanted to do that yesterday. 
Tom told me that he isn't going to do that. 
I know Tom is a lot stronger than I am. 
It wasn't an easy decision. 
I wonder if I'm still able do that. 
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that. 
Tom didn't tell anybody anything. 
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow. 
Tom said he didn't think that Mary really did what John said she did. 
Tom and Mary said that they were Canadian. 
They hoped they'd be able to win. 
Tom said he was glad that Mary could do that. 
I should've told you everything earlier. 
I thought that you had another reason. 
I think that you shouldn't have bought that car. 
Tom told Mary that he wasn't willing to do that. 
I should have known Tom would be busy. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was thirty. 
Tom said that he heard someone yelling. 
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do that. 
Tom thought I didn't have to do that. 
No one asked for your help. 
I thought that Tom did that yesterday. 
Tom wasn't allowed to board the plane because he didn't hold a valid travel document. 
Something is not right. 
Tom believes that Mary is trying to discredit him. 
Tom didn't seem too mad. 
Tom said he thought that Mary wasn't through doing that yet. 
I think that Tom won't be early. 
Tom told me that Mary was nervous. 
Samurai lived by a code of honor called "Bushido". 
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that. 
Tom said that Mary has been here before. 
I can't believe that Tom actually did that. 
I don't think I've bought everything that I need. 
Tom said that he didn't have anything to do. 
I should have noticed it before. 
I thought that Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom wanted to do that or not. 
Tom said he thought that we might have a problem. 
It rained three days straight. 
Tom thought that Mary was pregnant. 
When was the first time that Tom did that? 
Do you know whether Tom and Mary are allowed to do that? 
We told everyone we were moving to Australia. 
Please do that tomorrow or the day after. 
I don't think that Tom is married anymore. 
Tom said he thought that Mary would be alone. 
Everyone knows that Tom and I don't like each other. 
I will see you tomorrow. 
They say they were hungry. 
Tom said that he should have done that. 
Tom has been cremated. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary had already finished doing that. 
Tom told me that he thought that he might be able to do that. 
I suspect that Tom is still in love with his ex-wife. 
I know that Tom knew Mary was the one who had to do that. 
Tom very rarely waits for anybody. 
I just assumed everybody was going to do that. 
I don't think that you understand what this means. 
It isn't possible. 
I don't think that you have the guts. 
I've been busy since yesterday. 
Tom said that I shouldn't have tried doing that by myself. 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't tried to do that. 
Tom was the one who told me that I needed to do that. 
I didn't think that we could get home by 2:30. 
Tom said that he couldn't sleep last night. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was creative. 
Tom could've come yesterday, but he didn't. 
I didn't know Tom didn't want to do that alone. 
Tom thinks he's better than anybody else. 
I wonder whether or not Tom was able to do that by himself. 
Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't done it. 
I suspect that Tom will probably have to do that. 
You know that I'm not good with secrets. 
I'm not as busy now as I was at this time last year. 
I would have talked to Tom instead of just ignoring him. 
I thought that you'd want to meet my family. 
I don't think that Tom will be disobedient. 
Tom said that he was going to do that every day after he retired. 
There isn't much I can do to help, I'm afraid. 
Tom and Mary are both still not married. 
I know that Tom knew Mary couldn't do that. 
We're at school together. 
I'd like you to look over these documents. 
Tom is tired. 
Tom said that he didn't need a lawyer. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd be going by train. 
I didn't know Tom didn't really want to do that by himself. 
Tom said that he was going to ask Mary to leave. 
Tom and Mary will be going out for a walk after lunch. 
I know that Tom is grouchy. 
Tom is passed out. 
Doing that would be difficult. 
Tom said that he didn't know anything about Mary. 
I thought that Tom lived in Australia. 
I'm very surprised that Tom didn't want to do that. 
Tom doesn't think you'll be able to do that. 
Tom said he thought that he'd be arrested. 
I don't think that Tom is available. 
I don't think that Tom is doing that. 
I wonder whether or not Tom is interested. 
I don't think that Tom liked the song you wrote about him. 
I think I'll buy this tie. 
Tom thought that he might not be required to do that by himself. 
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary has never done that before. 
Tom gave me all the money that I asked for. 
Tom said that Mary knew that John might want to do that by himself. 
The wood's got saturated with water. 
I don't think that Tom understood. 
They said they'd been handcuffed. 
Tom is able to do that, but Mary isn't. 
I don't think that it's a problem anymore. 
Tom told me that he thinks that he'll do that tomorrow. 
I thought that it would clear up in the afternoon. 
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30. 
I'm an insomniac. 
Tom said that he'll ask Mary if she wants to do that. 
I know that that doesn't matter. 
Tom says that Mary is trustworthy. 
Tom and Mary told me that they enjoyed the picnic. 
I know I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway. 
I think that Tom is the one who painted this fence. 
Tom must have thought Mary could speak French. 
He is a very affectionate father. 
How did Tom know that Mary would do that? 
Tom told me that he was in a lot of trouble. 
Tom thinks that it will rain tomorrow. 
I didn't know Tom owned a gun. 
I thought that there was a good chance that Tom would want to do that. 
I didn't think that Tom would want your old bicycle. 
I wonder whether or not Tom knows who left this package on my desk. 
Tom should have been found guilty. 
It's not working yet. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary would be angry. 
You're not really planning on helping Tom, are you? 
Tom, it isn't necessary to apologize. 
I am already late. 
Tom knows that he has a problem. 
I became a doctor so I could help people. 
You can't buy happiness. 
You promised you'd do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be absent. 
It isn't going to be as hard to do as you think it'll be. 
Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't like him. 
Are you over eighteen years old? 
Tom won't leave his kids here with us. 
Tom didn't realize we wanted to do that. 
Tom said he thought that you were likely to do that. 
Tom said Mary thought that he might be required to do that the next time he travels. 
Tom said that he did that for Mary. 
Tom said that he doesn't think it's necessary to do that. 
Tom said Mary isn't sure if John wants to do that or not. 
I thought that things would get better. 
I hope Tom and Mary aren't quicker at doing that than I am. 
Tom said that he is glad that you're back. 
Tom said that he thought Mary was unlikely to do that. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited. 
The way you're planning on doing that is dangerous. 
You should have come sooner. 
I think that Tom is strong. 
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday. 
I seriously doubt that Tom will be there. 
Tom said he's really glad he moved to Australia. 
I know Tom is a forest ranger. 
It'll be difficult for Tom to do that. 
They said they'd only talk to you. 
French is her native language. 
I don't think Tom ought to do that alone. 
Tom picked his bag up and left. 
I'm not the only one here who isn't married. 
Tom said that he knew that he might not need to do that again. 
They know they should do that today. 
You should have been a lawyer. 
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't know I'm here. 
I don't think that I need to wear a tie to the party. 
I don't think that there's any reason that Tom has to do that. 
Tom said that Mary was likely to still be pessimistic. 
I don't think that I could do that even if I tried. 
I know Tom hasn't yet asked Mary to do that. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was talented. 
I don't think doing that's a very good idea. 
I'm afraid that Tom might not do what he's supposed to do. 
Tom said that Mary didn't want to go to the concert. 
Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport. 
Tom said that he's driving to Boston on Monday. 
They told me they're sleepy. 
I know you and Tom will do that together. 
I think that this is the first time Tom has done that. 
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished. 
I know Tom is a very rich man. 
Tom must have been home at that time. 
I don't think that I'm going to like being here. 
There is no hope. 
Tom could've gone camping with you if you'd let him know that you were going. 
I don't think that Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he'd asked her not to. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that. 
Do you know how to read maps? 
Tom says Mary lies a lot. 
I doubt that Tom will ever do that. 
I think Tom is probably a pretty good lawyer. 
I thought that I could do that without any help. 
You are pulling my leg. 
I thought you said you'd never try to do that alone. 
I don't think that we'll do that by ourselves. 
I know Tom will be the last one to do that. 
Tom said he'd give Mary a book. 
I know Tom didn't know why I was planning to do that. 
Tom didn't know I was Mary's cousin. 
They said they didn't know any French. 
I thought that you might quit. 
I had no idea that Tom was planning on telling Mary not to do that. 
I thought that you wanted to be a dancer. 
I don't think that I'd be very good company. 
Tom says the party's over. 
It looks as if it is going to rain. 
Tom said that I might not want to do that by myself. 
Safety isn't guaranteed. 
Tom didn't offer to help. 
I think that Tom will be truthful. 
I assumed Tom had told you that I would be here. 
Did you know that I was going to get arrested? 
She's a despicable human being. 
Tom intends to do that already. 
Take your school uniform off. 
I suspect that Tom will have to help Mary do that. 
I'm afraid that I can't. 
I know Tom is almost as tall as you. 
The first time that I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old. 
Tom says that Australia is his favorite country. 
I suspect that Tom has never done that. 
I thought that we could help out. 
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid? 
I want to stay longer. 
Tom plans to do that today. 
You're the same age as me. 
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try doing that. 
Can you tell me who's coming tonight? 
Tom said he wished he'd given flowers to Mary. 
They said they had alibis. 
Tom could do what he needed to do. 
I knew that you wouldn't like Australia. 
I could not think of anything. 
I wish that you'd never told me. 
Tom won't know that I'm here. 
I don't think that you're as good of a driver as you say you are. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary had to do that. 
They told me they were lonely. 
What is the time now? 
Tom said that things went well. 
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French. 
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital. 
Tom said that he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that. 
I doubt that we'll be able to prove that. 
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom couldn't speak French. 
Tom was surprised no one else was there. 
I'm not surprised that Tom doesn't have to do that. 
He's not very good at the game of politics. 
Tom thought that it would be funny to put an egg on Mary's chair. 
They said they didn't feel hot. 
This is the first time that I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria. 
Tom said that he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon. 
Tom says he doesn't plan on doing that. 
I thought you said no one was going to be here. 
Tom thinks that Mary is pushy. 
I'm brassic. 
Is there anything that I can do to help? 
Tom drank less than Mary. 
Tom said he assumed that Mary would want to do that. 
One can't do lots of things at the same time. 
I cannot remember her name. 
The fathers work. 
Tom and Mary say that they aren't afraid. 
I'll save a piece of pie for you. 
I thought that I was going to be asked to give a speech. 
It's a privilege to meet you. 
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him that she had to do that. 
Tom said that he thought you could help us today. 
I'm accustomed to staying up late. 
I thought that Tom looked happy. 
Tom said that Mary should do that someplace else. 
No one seemed to want to do that. 
Tom said he knew that he might not be required to do that by himself. 
Nobody told you about the meeting, did they? 
I'm aware that this is Monday. 
Tom says he needs to find somebody to do that for him. 
I think that Tom was supposed to be here by now. 
I know Tom and Mary are divorced. 
Tom must've seen us. 
I know Tom doesn't know he isn't supposed to be doing that here. 
I know Tom was going to do that in Australia last month. 
Tom doesn't have any reason not to do that. 
Mary told me she thought that Tom was handsome. 
I didn't know that you'd be jealous. 
I think Tom and Mary both want something to eat. 
They said they didn't mind doing that. 
I'm afraid that I have some bad news. 
I think that Tom wants you to do that. 
Tom said that I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here. 
Tom and Mary said they aren't sick. 
I knew that Tom ought to do that outside. 
I wonder whether or not I should do that. 
I suspect Tom and Mary know something is going on. 
I know exactly where I'm going. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was retired. 
What is your last name? 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary had left. 
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would have to do that. 
I know Tom knows that Mary seldom does that anymore. 
You're braver than I am. 
Tom said that he was getting drowsy. 
They said they tried to do that once. 
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks. 
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary says. 
It would have been interesting to do that. 
If you'd told me earlier, I would've dressed up. 
I think that Tom is scared. 
Tom said that he's sure Mary can swim. 
What is her problem? 
I think that Tom is focused. 
I'm not interested in this. 
I thought that the police were looking for Tom. 
Why's everybody staring at me? 
Tom has everything that he needs. 
They view foreigners with suspicion; I view everyone with suspicion. 
I don't think that I can do that better than you. 
You could have let me know you were going to be late. 
Tom is delirious. 
Willingness to correct is an indication of wisdom. 
Tom would never do that! 
I don't think that anyone else wants to do that today. 
It isn't as humid today as it was yesterday. 
If I had known how to do it, I would have done it myself. 
Tom fixed his bicycle. 
You aren't really planning on taking pictures, are you? 
He's two years younger than me. 
Tom and Mary told me they were frustrated. 
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore. 
I thought that you said that you've seen people doing that. 
It's obvious that Tom is waiting for somebody. 
He doesn't watch TV at all. 
Tom said that he's reluctant to do that for us. 
Give it back. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might help us today. 
I thought that the concert went pretty well. 
I cannot cook at all. 
I thought that Tom knew what we needed to do. 
I'm afraid your plan won't work. 
I don't think that anyone saw us do that. 
Tom said that he thought Mary might be able win. 
I wonder whether Tom has another one. 
Everybody except Tom seemed to be having fun. 
Tom said that he needed money so he could buy something to eat. 
Tom wasn't surprised Mary did that. 
I knew Tom was finished doing that. 
I'm not sure that that's possible. 
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me. 
I thought Tom was still in school. 
I knew Tom would be the next one to do that. 
They'll be glad they didn't do that. 
They say they'll buy that for you. 
They say they don't need money. 
Tom isn't willing to go by himself. 
I know Tom didn't need to do that with us. 
Everybody agrees that it was the right decision. 
Tom got out of the bath and put on his clothes. 
I don't think that Tom is planning on helping us. 
They say they feel better now. 
I assume that you'll be going to the dance with Tom. 
Tom thought that I might be required to do that by myself. 
I don't think that's anybody that I know. 
I don't think that Tom did what you say he did. 
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name. 
I don't think that it'll be difficult for Tom to do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't know where Mary wants to go. 
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were kids. 
Tom really thought we didn't need to do that. 
It's not good for anyone. 
Tom said that he often thinks about leaving. 
Do Tom and Mary know you don't like them? 
I know that I've been very stupid. 
Both Tom and Mary are full-time students. 
I know Tom and only Tom needs to do that. 
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary has to do that today. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary don't like me very much. 
I wonder whether or not I can do that. 
Tom really thought we wanted to do that. 
I wish that I could visit Australia. 
She's eating. 
He is the love of my life. 
I think Tom is a good painter. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary is making for dinner. 
It wasn't that difficult to find a pair of shoes that fit. 
I never would've permitted Tom to do that. 
I've promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him. 
Tom sings better than I do. 
Tom said that he had a difficult day. 
Are you game for a swim? 
Tom and Mary still hope they can win. 
Tom knows that we can't win. 
I don't think that I could do that. 
You're to blame. 
I thought that you said your car was stolen. 
I didn't know Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary. 
Tom and Mary both lived in Australia when they were children. 
If Tom doesn't do that, neither will I. 
Tom told me he thought that Mary was funny. 
I know that Tom didn't know Mary should do that. 
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer. 
In his heart, Tom knew that he'd never return. 
We aren't ready to go home yet. 
Tom should have eaten more. 
I thought that Tom was going to give Mary flowers. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do that in the near future. 
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone. 
I should have listened to what my mother said. 
Tom's wasting time. 
I think that Tom was exaggerating. 
I was convinced I shouldn't do that. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still nervous. 
Though this be madness, yet there is method in't. 
Tom told me everything I needed to know. 
They told everyone they were upset. 
Tom said that he won't do that unless I help him. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was sincere. 
She knows about that sort of thing. 
I don't think that I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are ready to do that. 
What is the name of your pharmacy? 
I don't think that anybody else wants to come. 
I knew Tom was very busy. 
Tom said that he thought that I might not need to do that until October. 
What's worrying you, Tom? 
Tom is a travelling salesman. 
I suspect that Tom isn't in Boston anymore. 
Tom is convinced he needs to do that. 
This is the first time I've visited Australia. 
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that. 
Everyone knows we killed Tom. 
Tom said that he'd rather not go to Australia with us. 
Dinner's not ready yet. 
I hope that I'll be able to help you tomorrow. 
Sure we could do that, but it would be really hard to do. 
I could've saved Tom's life. 
There's a good chance Tom will ask Mary to the dance. 
Tom told me that he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library. 
I don't think that we can take care of ourselves. 
Need a lift? 
I thought that I made my reasons clear. 
Tom is somebody that I look up to. 
Tom says he's sorry that he broke his promise. 
I think I have almost enough money to buy the computer I want. 
I realize Tom will try to do that. 
I am very happy to see you. 
They said they're cold. 
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that. 
Tom has just done what he should have done last week. 
Tom says he doesn't usually wear underwear. 
I know Tom is a better musician than Mary. 
Tom said he thought that he knew what Mary planned on doing. 
Tom and Mary said that they'd win and they did. 
Nobody knew that except Tom. 
Tom thought that Mary wasn't cold. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary still lived in Australia. 
I thought that Tom would be happy about that. 
I know Tom would permit you to do that. 
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was asleep. 
Tom goes to Boston every chance that he gets. 
I know Tom never considered doing that. 
Didn't you know that I was hoping Tom would do that? 
They said they'll call you later. 
I promise we'll be listening to everything you say. 
I think you'll enjoy it there. 
It isn't all that ridiculous. 
I wonder whether we have to do that or not. 
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today. 
The fuse is blown. 
Tom and Mary were unable to help me do that. 
Tom should have been interested. 
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today. 
It's not good to ridicule people in public. 
We should have planned for this. 
I don't think that you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that. 
They say they never did that. 
Tom and Mary said that they isn't going to do that. 
I know that Tom is connected. 
Tom said that he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia. 
Let's get married! 
Get the fuck out of here! 
I think that Tom has been to Boston at least one time. 
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow. 
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been. 
Tom said that Mary was living in Australia. 
They told me they don't like to study in the morning. 
You tricked me. 
We're too busy for that, Tom. 
Is this seat vacant? 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that. 
You are free to go. 
I know Tom is confident. 
Tom thinks that it's pretty good. 
Tom said that he and Mary had a fight this morning. 
Tom might be lying. 
I heard that Tom is living in Australia. 
No one told me I wasn't supposed to park there. 
Tom could have taken the money. 
Tom doubted Mary would keep her promise. 
Make sure no one enters. 
I doubt that that'll ever change. 
Tom told everyone he was bored. 
It was clear Tom was going to do that with Mary. 
I suspect that Tom is drunk. 
I met somebody yesterday who knows we. 
Tom told me that he didn't have insurance. 
I'm hoping I can live here with you. 
Those agenda items were discussed together. 
Tom said that he felt good about that. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary know that something interesting is about to happen. 
You know I need to do that, don't you? 
They must've found out who I was. 
I don't think that I passed the test. 
I knew Tom was a bad loser. 
I don't think that Tom is dead. 
They said they didn't feel anything. 
I knew that Tom would like Mary. 
I don't think that Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him. 
Tom said that he thought that he wouldn't be able to win. 
My impression of the United States is very good. 
I don't like anyone bothering when I'm working. 
They stayed friends. 
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be back soon. 
Tom said that he wished he hadn't permitted Mary to do that. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was having fun. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary didn't like John very much. 
I don't think that Tom can do that without some help. 
Doing that isn't hard. 
I'm very sorry that I kissed Tom. 
I am horrified. 
Tom told me he was very hungry when he got home. 
Tom said that Mary would likely not know how to do that. 
I don't think Tom knows he isn't supposed to do that. 
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do that. 
Tom said that he heard three shots fired. 
I think that you're stuck-up. 
Didn't you know Tom had a dog? 
I knew Tom wouldn't want to stop doing that. 
Tom and Mary told me they'd lied. 
Tom is a bully, just like John is. 
I'm sure Tom knew was going to happen. 
I'm Tom's friend. 
I thought that Tom would've forgotten me by now. 
They say they're working very hard. 
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not. 
I don't think that I can move to Boston until next year. 
The only person who could've done this is Tom. 
They told me they were well. 
I thought that if I broke up with you, I'd never have to see you again. 
I'm decorating the classroom. 
I know that Tom knew Mary wanted to do that. 
Tom and Mary said they were depressed. 
Tom knows I don't like him. 
I know Tom doesn't know I have to do that. 
Tom said I should have left earlier. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary could have done that by herself. 
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door. 
It's difficult to do that, isn't it? 
The gift I got from Tom was the best. 
I don't think that I have enough money. 
Tom wasn't given the chance that you and I were. 
How did you know that Tom was planning on doing that? 
Will you give me a pen? 
You may stay here as long as you keep quiet. 
I have a feeling that I've been here before. 
Tom was rude to everybody. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still alive. 
What's the stupidest thing that you've ever done? 
Tom and Mary didn't tell anybody that they'd won the lottery. 
Is there any possibility that Tom will want to do that with us? 
Both Tom and Mary like old movies. 
Tom and Mary said that they could do that today. 
Tom woke up the children and told them to get ready for school. 
I don't like you! 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be hungry. 
Tom said that Mary thought that John might not want to do that by himself. 
I didn't know you were planning to do that while you were in Australia. 
I don't think that Tom rides his motorcycle anymore. 
Tom said that he doesn't feel like doing that. 
I know Tom doesn't know why I did that on Monday. 
Tom apparently should have done that. 
I don't think Tom knows that he'll never be able to do that. 
I can't put up with the noise any longer. 
I know that Tom didn't know we wouldn't be able to do that. 
I hope that you already know what to do. 
Didn't I tell you that I wouldn't go to Australia? 
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here. 
Tom said that he didn't want to leave. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be at home. 
You're a better chess player than I am. 
Tom said that he liked the idea. 
I'm going to watch TV this evening. 
I think Tom is a few months older than Mary. 
I think that you know Tom already. 
I should have kissed Tom. 
I know Tom knows why I need to do that. 
I'm sorry that I opened your mail by mistake. 
Tom thought that Mary wasn't yet finished doing that. 
I wonder whether Tom was able to do that. 
Had I taken that plane, I would be dead by now. 
I don't think that Tom would enjoy this movie. 
I'm certain your intentions are honorable. 
I know Tom is about the same weight as me. 
Tom said that he didn't know why the meeting was postponed. 
You should have taken his advice. 
They say they like doing that. 
I know someone needs to do that. 
Tom told me that Mary wasn't afraid to do that. 
I hope that Tom isn't tired. 
They said they were conservative. 
I don't think that I'll be scared. 
I know Tom can't actually do that even though he says he can. 
We could have done it by ourselves. 
I thought that maybe you'd have an idea. 
Tom and Mary said they were heartbroken. 
I wonder if Tom is really at home. 
I know Tom knows that I'm not supposed to be doing that. 
Tom and I both haven't yet done that. 
Do not pick your nose! 
I have to do something with these radishes. 
Tom pleaded guilty and was deported. 
I didn't know that you needed to do that. 
Tom says he plans to stay in Australia as long as he can. 
I don't think that there's any way I can help you. 
Tom thought Mary wouldn't forgive him. 
I don't think that I can help you do that. 
I know Tom is the kind of guy who'd do that. 
I suspect that Tom will help Mary do that. 
Tom said that he didn't know how Mary would do that. 
I won't tell anybody that you're in Australia. 
Tom said that he didn't want to do that alone. 
Tom said that Mary didn't look too worried. 
Tom can swim much faster than Mary can. 
Tom would have done that correctly the first time if you'd helped him. 
I'm accustomed to cold weather. 
I think Tom hurt his leg. 
I know Tom didn't know he should do that. 
The current political situation isn't very stable. 
Tom said that his son was a good athlete. 
Tom and Mary said that they weren't jealous. 
Tom's contract expires October twentieth. 
I don't think that Tom would be nervous doing that. 
I know Tom is a Red Cross volunteer. 
I knew that Tom wouldn't do what we asked him to do. 
They told me they were ready to do that. 
I don't think that Tom really did that all by himself. 
How did you know that Tom was going to be in Australia all week? 
I thought that Tom wasn't surprised. 
I thought that you said that we weren't going to sing. 
They said they'll do that soon. 
I know the last thing that you want to do is hurt me. 
I can't believe that you wanted to do that. 
I have the impression Tom is doing well. 
Tom didn't know Mary was John's girlfriend. 
They said they were very sick. 
I know Tom did that once. 
Tom's waiting. 
I think Tom and Mary have both never done that. 
I knew I should have studied French. 
Tom said that you're stubborn. 
Maybe next time. 
I think that Tom is lying. 
I know Tom knows that I shouldn't be doing that. 
I thought that you might be in Australia this week. 
I'm sorry I made you wait for so long today. 
Tom thinks that Mary is glad that that's going to happen. 
It isn't until you get sick that you realize the value of good health. 
I thought that I'd broken my leg, but an X-ray showed that I hadn't. 
Tom said that he wasn't aware that Mary had done that. 
There's not much that we can do to help. 
I don't think that Tom understood what we wanted him to do. 
I don't know what that is. 
I wonder whether or not Tom knew I had to do that. 
I doubt the police are going to arrest Tom. 
I've lived here for thirty years. 
Tom told me that he hated doing that. 
Tom said that he thought that I was dead. 
Tom said that I don't need to do that. 
They told me they'd do that for us. 
Tom said Mary knew that John might be allowed to do that. 
I'm not proud of my behavior. 
Tom said that he didn't have your permission to do that. 
Tom and Mary said that they didn't want to talk. 
I don't think that Tom liked your song very much. 
I would've done that if I could have. 
They said they wouldn't try to do that. 
I don't think that Tom and Mary have much in common. 
Tom didn't know Mary was planning on doing that. 
Tom says that he didn't do anything illegal. 
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be cooperative. 
Something is very wrong here. 
I didn't know Tom lived in the dorm. 
I thought that you'd want to see this. 
Tom told me that he wasn't planning to join the team. 
I hope that Tom is glad that that's going to happen. 
They told me they'd likely do that. 
Tom and Mary told me they were free. 
Tom said that Mary would probably go to Australia with him. 
Even if Tom had wanted to do that, he wouldn't have. 
Boston is not at all like Chicago. 
I really should have told Tom not to go to Boston. 
I think my neighbor may have died. 
I don't think that Tom has done that yet. 
I don't think that Tom would be late unless he had a very good reason. 
Tom is cooking. 
Tom said that he thought Mary would be cold. 
Tom said that he thought that we could win. 
I do not trust governments. 
I didn't think that there was anybody I knew in Australia. 
Do you think that I should go to Australia with Tom? 
I think that Tom should stay here with us. 
I don't think that Tom is going to be a problem anymore. 
Didn't you know that Tom was Mary's brother? 
I don't think that I know that guy. 
Tom said that he planned on going on Monday. 
I'm afraid I might be late. 
I put on my helmet. 
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and he would end up telling them everything. 
I knew Tom would be able to do that if he really needed to. 
Tom thinks that you're going to be here tomorrow. 
Everybody knows that Tom is lying. 
Tom must have seen it. 
Tom might be a traitor. 
I knew that Tom would unlikely agree to do that. 
They must've arrived home by this time. 
Tom told me he's going to talk to Mary about that. 
I thought that you weren't going to tell anyone. 
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary's shoe size is. 
She'll do that if no one stops her. 
Put your guns down. 
She is my first love. 
In the summer, eggs go bad quickly. 
I've taught my dog to sit up and beg. 
I promise I won't tell anybody where it is. 
Tom thought that we shouldn't go. 
Tom isn't as fat as me. 
No one's listening anymore. 
I thought that you were Tom's friend. 
They said they felt very lonely. 
I don't think that I'm unlucky. 
Tom announced he wasn't going to do that. 
Tom really should have stayed where he was. 
Tom thinks that Mary won't teach French. 
Tom told me that he was fine. 
Tom said that he wasn't disappointed. 
Tom said he wished that he hadn't convinced Mary to do that. 
Tom said Mary knew that John might have to do that by himself. 
Have you ever been stuck in a lift? 
Tom said that he tries to be optimistic. 
Tom said he wished that you wouldn't do that again. 
Doing that will be a lot harder than you think it'll be. 
Tom said that he didn't mean to hit me. 
What hope attends you through this gate? Not one! 
I'll see if Tom's in his office. 
Tom and Mary said that they prefers red wine. 
Tom and Mary say that they may not have to do that. 
I hope you know that the last thing that I want to do is hurt you. 
You're better than me. 
I wonder whether Tom will be OK. 
Since my husband became sick he's lost as much as 20 kilograms and his pants are now baggy. 
Tom has never had a problem with anyone. 
Tom would have eaten more if he'd had time. 
I think I would like that. 
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to do that on October 20th. 
I know deep down you're a good person. 
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew that he'd been arrested. 
Tom said that Mary doesn't think John will do that to Alice. 
There is no doubt that I would not have been able to do this without your help. 
I wish I didn't have to throw this away. 
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that. 
Do you think that Tom would like to go camping with us next weekend? 
Do I have to answer in English? 
I think that Tom hasn't agreed to do that. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was talented. 
I think you know that Tom isn't going to be here today. 
Tom said he had to work on October 20th. 
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Australia. 
I want you to know I'll work very hard. 
Tom looks older than he actually is. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was lazy. 
I have a lot of work to do before I can go home. 
All we can do now is hope Tom does what he's promised to do. 
I haven't read it! 
I don't think that Tom really wants to do that anymore. 
I thought that you didn't want to talk about this. 
They have a green carpet in the living room. 
Tom said everybody he knows enjoys doing that. 
You're the next in line for promotion. 
Didn't you know Tom used to be married to Mary? 
Tom said that he liked doing that. 
Tom and Mary swore that they didn't do that. 
I know Tom doesn't know why he should do that. 
Tom must have gone ahead. 
Tom thought that it over carefully. 
The police suspect Tom was murdered. 
I doubt Tom is still unconscious. 
I know Tom isn't used to sitting on the floor. 
I've created a few websites. 
Tom said that Mary likes driving. 
We're trying to close the box. 
I know Tom will be through doing that. 
Tom said that he hasn't yet done any of that. 
I think that Tom is over thirty. 
I didn't know you were planning to do that so soon. 
We should have done what you advised. 
I thought that you said that you hated doing that. 
Tom told me that he wasn't an expert. 
I know Tom wouldn't ask Mary not to do that. 
Christmas is right around the corner. 
Tom isn't very likely to want to do that. 
Tom is the smartest person that I've ever met. 
A man came to visit you last night. 
I'm a bit drunk. 
They aren't as tough as they look. 
I guess that this is a step in the right direction. 
I'll make sure Tom does that sometime today. 
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time that he saw her. 
I haven't understood anything you've said. 
You should have left while you had the chance. 
I thought that you said that you had a dog. 
Nobody is out of the woods yet. 
Tom said that we could go to Boston with him if we wanted to. 
That doesn't change anything. 
Tom's being mean. 
We didn't know Tom was going to do that. 
I didn't know that you were still planning on doing that. 
Hi, everybody. 
I don't think anybody would agree to do that 
Tom couldn't believe his vacation was over so quickly. 
You can't make bricks without straw. 
I don't play tennis as much as I used to. 
Tom said that Mary wouldn't likely be mad. 
Tom and Mary say they hope you win. 
I asked Tom if he knew anyone who taught French. 
I'm bored out of my mind. 
Tom should have done what Mary told him to do. 
Tom is somebody you can trust. 
I knew Tom told Mary to ask John not to do that. 
Tom and Mary say they'll help us today. 
I'll stay at home if it rains tomorrow. 
If I'd done my best, I might've succeeded. 
I know that Tom and Mary have both finished doing that. 
Tom would have done that if you'd asked him to. 
I know Tom is a lot smarter than Mary is. 
How much did you spend a day when you were in Australia? 
I hope that I'm able to do that. 
I meant it when I said that I wanted to marry you. 
I don't think that anyone was satisfied. 
It looks like somebody has ripped a page out of this book. 
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that. 
I don't think that Tom has time to talk to you now. 
I think that you shouldn't have done that by yourself. 
He's a man who gets things done. 
I hope you'll be my friends. 
Tom said that he wanted to try riding a unicycle. 
I figured that you might know why Tom left early. 
Tom assumed everyone knew he'd spent time in prison. 
Tell me your friends, and I will tell you who you are. 
They said they were very worried. 
They told me they were hungry. 
It'll be finished by the time you get here. 
Tom might not have died in the accident. 
Tom said that he thought that he'd be able to find another job. 
I thought only happened in fairytales. 
I don't think Tom was busy today. 
Tom said that he assumed that Mary wouldn't cry. 
I'll be there on the 20th. 
I don't think that it's likely that Tom will help us. 
Tom must have cried. 
Tom has lost both parents. 
Tom said that he could've done that on his own. 
I doubt if doing that will be difficult. 
We have to defeat our foes. 
Tom is upset. 
They told everyone they were suspicious. 
I knew that you wouldn't like it in Australia. 
I know I couldn't do that even if I tried. 
I don't think that I can move this bookcase without some help. 
Tom said he thought Mary was having a good time in Australia. 
I know Tom is a hockey fan. 
Tom said he knew that was what Mary wanted to do. 
I don't think Tom knows I think he's stupid. 
I hope that Tom and I aren't inconveniencing you. 
Tom told me that he thought that Mary knew French. 
Tom said that he needed to be more careful. 
I thought that you and Tom didn't like each other. 
You should tell Tom you aren't planning on swimming. 
Tom assumed everybody knew that Mary couldn't understand French. 
Is it true Tom thinks that I believe that? 
I love to play my guitar. 
They said they'll never leave early. 
I didn't know Tom would be able to do that by himself. 
Tom might be desperate. 
The road parallels the river. 
I suspect Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen. 
Tom let Mary know that he needed to do that. 
Don't let anyone in. 
Tom said that he felt tempted to do that. 
I'm not sure that I'm ready for this. 
Tom is in this picture as well. 
Tom said that he didn't know why Mary didn't enjoy the movie. 
Tom said that he might possibly win. 
I don't think Tom and Mary are planning on helping us. 
That's not a bad option. 
Tom told me he thought Mary used to play the cello. 
I know Tom knows that I shouldn't be doing that here. 
Tom looked mad when Mary said that. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary should do that again. 
Tom said he wanted to know whether I could swim. 
"Is it true?" "I think so." 
I'm not sure that it'll do you any good. 
Tom said that Mary isn't pessimistic. 
I'd like to report a crime. 
I didn't know Tom didn't know French. 
I know Tom didn't know I knew how to do that. 
Tom told me I should do that soon. 
I am afraid I can't help you. 
I know that I'm not alone. 
They aren't as innocent as they seem. 
We don't have snow here. 
I didn't think that Tom would help us do that. 
Tom said that Mary is probably still heartbroken. 
They may do that if they want. 
I know Tom is a very shy boy. 
Tom knew I was angry. 
That's all I have. 
Tom doesn't want anyone to know that he's going to Australia. 
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary really had to go yesterday morning. 
I promise you that I won't be late. 
I knew Tom had to do that by himself. 
Tom said that he thought that there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that. 
You could have done that yourself. 
I wonder whether the weather will hold. 
It would have been romantic to do that. 
I know Tom is a much better drummer than me. 
I eat here. 
Tom said he thought that it would be dangerous for Mary to walk home by herself at night. 
Did you know Tom was going to do that with Mary? 
Tom told everyone that he was glad that was going to happen. 
I know Tom can swim better than I can. 
Tom and Mary told me that they had to go. 
Tom wiped his mouth with the towel Mary handed him. 
Good job, everybody. 
They must know that I'm innocent. 
You don't allow your children to do that, do you? 
Tom's big-headed. 
I don't think I should tell Tom I'm going to Boston. 
He likes to play football. 
I know Tom didn't know that Mary could do that. 
I know Tom is a lot stronger than Mary is. 
Tom thought that the burning car would explode. 
Do you really think that Tom is determined to do that? 
Tom could be in Australia for a long time. 
I think that Tom could do that if he tried. 
Nobody knew that you were in Australia. 
Nobody has been injured yet. 
I don't think that it's up to us to decide. 
You are handsome. 
This is the first time that I've ridden a horse. 
They said they like to do that. 
Clear the area, please. 
Tom tried hard to calm everybody down. 
We all thought it strange that she had ditched such a pleasant guy. 
Those who know me know that I can't do that. 
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was on the school bus. 
Tom said that Mary thought John might want to do that early tomorrow morning. 
Tom already knows that Mary is planning on staying in Australia for another three days. 
How many kilograms have you lost so far? 
Tom and Mary say that they're feeling very sleepy. 
I can't stand naughty children. 
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary was hungry. 
I thought that I heard somebody talking.

I knew Tom was expecting you to do that.

Why's everybody staring at you?

Tom said that he was going to let Mary win. 
I know that you like coffee. 
Tom and Mary said that they felt great. 
I didn't know you had a sense of humor 
I know you won't enjoy doing that. 
Has anybody ever told you what really happened? 
I'm an artist. 
Tom won't let anyone do that. 
The report isn't quite finished. 
They said they got out of the way. 
I'm pretty sure Tom has never been a patient of mine. 
Tom bought every painting Mary painted. 
I know Tom knows Mary did that. 
We won't be able to avoid being punished this time. 
I expected that Tom wouldn't do anything. 
Tom said that Mary could've done that on her own. 
They say they'll never do that again. 
They say they'll sing. 
I should've read the insurance policy more carefully. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are sleepy. 
Walking would've been faster. 
Mary has post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Wait here till I get back. 
Tom said that he thought that Mary was always in her office on Mondays. 
Tom said that he'd like to know why Mary had to do that. 
I think Tom used to be a member of our church. 
I know Tom already knows why Mary didn't do that. 
Tom didn't tell anyone he had thought about doing that. 
Tom might be in. Let me check. 
Tom said that he thought that would probably not happen. 
I don't believe that you can speak Hebrew. 
I know Tom knows Mary doesn't want to do that. 
What color is it? 
I can say please and thank you, but that's as far as my knowledge of German goes. 
Tom thinks that some of his friends may do that. 
When she came to the place where the footpath led across the marsh, she found small pools of water, and a great deal of mud, so she threw the loaf of bread into the mud, and walked upon it, so that she might pass without wetting her feet. 
Tom thought that Mary did that on purpose. 
Tom must have been showing off. 
Tom was paid more than he expected. 
This blackboard isn't black, but green. 
Everybody waited. 
They weren't sympathetic. 
That's the fastest train in the world. 
I wonder if there's a chance that Tom will help us. 
I suspect Tom doesn't do his homework by himself. 
Tom said that he didn't have any trouble doing that. 
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary studies French. 
I know Tom didn't know that he didn't need to do that. 
I'm almost certain we can trust Tom. 
I know Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that. 
I knew Tom didn't know any other way to do that. 
We've always been friends. 
Tom and Mary said that they can't speak French. 
Tom said he'd help. 
Tom told me he'd already done that. 
I think that Tom would be able to do that if he really needed to. 
I think that I could come to Australia for Christmas. 
I know you won't have time to do that until next Monday. 
They don't make 'em like they used to. 
Sometimes I think that Tom lives here.

I thought that it was incredible. 
Do you think that Tom will stay in Australia long? 
Tom said that he did it wrong. 
It isn't a difficult question. 
I didn't think that Tom would mind buying that for you. 
I know Tom would like you to do that for Mary. 
My name is Tom. What's yours? 
Water spouted from the broken tap. 
Tom knows Mary loves John. 
Don't play with the key. 
It's not rational. 
We should have listened to you, Tom.

I know that Tom was angry. 
I thought that I heard voices in the next room. 
I suspect that Tom isn't in Australia.

They told everyone they were ticklish. 
I suspect that Tom is alone. 
Tom told everyone he was interested. 
Tom and Mary said that they're unlucky. 
I thought Tom was going to win. 
I should have figured Tom would be late. 
I don't think that Tom liked the concert. 
How did you know that you didn't have to do that? 
That's not how we do things here.

I would have been unable to do that without your help. 
Tom speaks French a lot better than me. 
They told me they understood. 
Tom and Mary said they plan on doing that Monday. 
I don't think that there's any way out of this one.

I thought that there was a good chance Tom wouldn't want to go with us. 
Tom said that he thought it wouldn't be safe for Mary to walk home alone at night. 
Tom said that he was really glad Mary was able do that. 
Tom prefers to do that alone. 
I'm not as stupid as Tom is. 
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that. 
How do you know Tom was the one who did this? 
Tom is likely to tell Mary he isn't sleepy.

Just promise me you won't do anything silly.

I know that Tom will likely need to do that. 
I would like a glass of tequila. 
Please wait thirty minutes.

I was surprised Tom didn't want to do what everybody else wanted to do.

That never would have happened if Tom hadn't shown up.

Do you like drinking beer?

He has gone to the United States. 
I suspect that Tom will be back. 
Tom's parents told Tom not to do that. 
Where is Tom going? 
What is going on here? 
Tom said he wasn't sure that he could do it. 
I didn't know you'd be here, too. 
Tom got some wrong on the test. 
She made up her mind to go to the United States. 
I thought that Tom would've remembered today's meeting. 
I'm going to play soccer tomorrow. 
I don't think that that's possible. 
She dreamt of being a princess. 
Tom said that doing that was harder than he thought it would be. 
That's so typical of you. 
I didn't know that you did that last year. 
Tom thinks that Mary will be in Australia next weekend. 
Tom should have been here.

That's not high on my list of priorities. 
I think that Tom felt a bit threatened. 
Tom and Mary picked their toys up. 
Who's the girl in this picture? 
Tom thinks Mary will be ready to do that on October 20th.

I know I have to do that while I'm here in Boston. 
I wish I were with Tom back in Australia.

I think that Tom is still busy.

I have less than you. 
Tom told everybody he was skeptical. 
Tom thinks that Mary will be desperate to do that. 
I know Tom is almost always right, but this time he isn't. 
I suspect that Tom and Mary are scared of each other. 
I don't like having to admit I can't do something. 
I know Tom can probably do that faster that than Mary. 
Tom didn't learn to swim until he was thirteen years old. 
I have difficulty swallowing. 
I think that Tom got banned. 
I thought that you were doing a great job. 
There's a good chance that Tom will refuse to do that.

I don't think that it's important. 
I should have gone there with you.

It was clear Tom was expecting you to do that. 
We promise you we'll never do it again.

I thought that that was pretty clear. 
I think that I did that pretty well. 
I'm learning Arabic. 
Tom said that he'd be thrilled to do that. 
I wonder whether Tom really needed to do that or not. 
Tom should've been in Australia when he had the chance to. 
It isn't a computer problem. 
How could I've let that happen? 
You didn't know whether Tom and Mary were going to do that or not, did you? 
Tom started laughing and everyone else started laughing, too. 
If anybody can do that, you can. 
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative. 
Tom knows you aren't ready. 
How can you have a laptop, but no mobile? 
Tom said that he thought he would be able to do that today. 
I know Tom and Mary have never done that together. 
This method has its advantages and disadvantages. 
I know Tom used to be a preacher.

I know Tom is curious. 
Tom said that Mary needed to do that. 
I doubt we can prove that. 
Tom assumed that Mary would like the present he bought for her. 
I don't think that Tom wanted to say anything. 
I'm glad you didn't tell Tom. That would have ruined the surprise. 
Tom told everybody that Mary was there. 
I suspect that Tom is worried about that. 
I don't think that you'll ever be able to do that. 
It isn't fair. 
Tom said he agreed to do that. 
It seems that you aren't having a good time here.
