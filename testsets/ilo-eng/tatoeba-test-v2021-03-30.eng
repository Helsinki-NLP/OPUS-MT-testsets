Who don't you know here?
He came in through the window.
I agree to your plan.
I paid 300 dollars for this guitar.
I feel empowered.
She is cold to me.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting it.
Muiriel is 20 now.
The night is so dark.
I don't like Christmas anymore.
This bad weather will certainly have an effect on the crops.
Are these Tom's shoes?
I have nothing to ask forgiveness for.

If we have not covered all the questions you asked, please inform us.
Drinking beer refreshes me.
We're born between urine and feces.
My skin is soft.
I'm sure Tom would like that.
Everyone has their own opinion.
I will tell it to him at the proper time.
Should we wait for Tom here?
All we need is a little patience.

It's just that I don't like it.
I shouldn't have lied to you.
They were cowards.
Have you ever read any Chinese poems?
Tom gave Mary the money she needed to pay off her debts.
The trees are full of fruit.
Who brought them?
Her name's Irina.

I've been in Boston since October.
I'm 18 years old.

Goodbye!
Try it again.
I will be back soon.
