The punishment chosen for me is that I must not visit mass public gatherings and must not communicate with the organizers of the April 7 protest.
"All this time I wore an electronic bracelet and transmitter.
That is how they tracked my location.
I note that I was not restricted in my movements.
Recently I flew from Moscow where I was studying," said Andrei Borovikov.
After the sentence was pronounced the coordinator of Navalny's regional headquarters said that he would serve his sentence in Arkhangelsk.

How?
If we knew, we would have probably already fixed it.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to up such aspects as our one-on-one.
We have problems with this, in my view.
Kremlin supports smoking ban on residential building balconies
The Kremlin supports any measures that save people's lives, said the president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the smoking ban on apartment balconies and loggias.
Earlier the Cabinet approved changes to the Fire Prevention Rules, according to which it is forbidden to use an open flame on balconies and rooms of residential buildings.
Later, the Emergency Situations Ministry said that it includes a ban on smoking on the balconies and loggias of apartments and hotels.
The changes come into force from 1 October 2019.
Infringement will be an administrative offense.
The Kremlin welcomes any decision that helps save human life.
"We know how many fires occur, many of them have extremely tragic consequences and cause a public outcry.
So any life saved justifies such measures," Peskov said.
First and foremost the press secretary approves of it as a fire prevention measure, and not as a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not approve of smoking and is a healthy lifestyle proponent.

China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of Taipei legislation
China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of the so-called Taipei legislation, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the Chinese-US Three Communiqués.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Friday.
The US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations' approval of the legislation is also a serious breach of international law, the founding principles of international relations and crude interference in internal Chinese affairs, said Ma Xiaoguang.
According to him, Taiwan is a part of China and issues in connection with this are an internal matter for China.
"We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately cease introducing similar negative legislation and immediately cease interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Chinese-US relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China should and will be reunited.
This historic trajectory cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, said Xiaoguang.
TikTok is hiding undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the forbidden Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reported.
Documents obtained by the publication, reveal that the owners of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of their app are promoting Chinese foreign policy goals overseas.
Most of the violations concerning Chinese policy fall under "inciting hatred."
In every case, TikTok classifies the undesirable posts to fall under the scope of general rules so the social network's actions do not appear to be censorship.
For example, a ban on criticizing the Chinese socialist system falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on the politics or social rules of any country as well as constitutional monarchies, parliamentary systems and so on ..."
A ban on referring to the events of Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under "distorting the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists 20 forbidden names of "foreign leaders or politicians" including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The document states that banned materials fall under two categories.
Posts in the first category are deleted by the social network administrators and can lead to the user being blocked.
Less severe violations are included in the second category: such posts remain on the site but their circulation is restricted by the TikTok algorithm.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are out of date and are no longer used: "Now we use a local approach to moderating as well as drawing on independent local specialists."
TikTok has no specific restrictions on posts for Russian users, said Rustem Bogdanov, founder of Producer Center.
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially works with TikTok.
All the advertising materials from Producer Center's bloggers are agreed with the social network's representatives, but user materials can be posted without approval, said Bogdanov.
When asked about whether users could talk about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov spoke in the affirmative and said that he had seen such posts.
Roman Zaripov, founder of the Our Digital agency, agreed with Bogdanov: "The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no posting shocking content, discriminatory rhetoric and so on."
However, any content disliked by the moderators can fall under these rules, noted Zaripov.
Zapirov's agency is another of TikTok's Russian partners.
According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.
According to its user agreement, only people over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social network's administrators verify ages with the aid of artificial intelligence: a neural network analyses faces and determines how old people appear, said Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that a user is younger, the user may be deleted, he added.
According to RBK, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork co-working center.
Istanbul residents spoke of an earthquake in the city
Powerful earthquake caused panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake took place in Istanbul.
34 people were injured, ten of whom remain in hospitals.
Istanbul resident Melike admitted she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.

I was weeping right at my workstation.
Later I felt better, I got back to work.
But I am so ashamed now!" the young woman told the "360" TV channel.
"In Istanbul there was a really powerful earthquake.
I still cannot go back!

She also drew attention to communications problems after the earthquake.
The young woman said she could not phone through to her mother, however the internet was working "excellently" and she was able to send a message via WhatsApp.
As the site kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake all kindergartens and schools were closed, and all pupils were evacuated from them.
473 buildings were damaged.
The epicenter of the underground shocks was pinpointed 68 kilometers to the west of Istanbul, in the Sea of Marmara.
Matthews met with the management of Toronto.
Toronto forward Auston Matthews held a meeting with the club's management.

But everyone makes mistakes.

I don't consider our relationship to have been damaged.
The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare released the results of an investigation into the amputation of a child's arm
A Rostov region child had his arm amputated due to an error made by doctors, Vzglad reported, citing the local office of the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare's site.
The 11-year-old boy broke his arm, which was set in plaster at a Zernograd area hospital.
Some point after that, the child developed gangrene and his arm was amputated.
The results of the investigation revealed that errors were made in providing a timely and correct diagnosis as well as in the standard and level of treatment.
The investigation materials were given to the regional Investigative Committee's office of criminal investigations.
Earlier URA.RU reported that the head doctor of the Yuzhnouralsk regional hospital was arrested.
Russians warned over fake phone calls from banks
In Russia there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from swindlers using bank phone numbers.
Kommersant reported this, citing Central Bank information.
In the summer of 2019 the regulator provided telecommunications operators with information about more than 2,500 phone numbers from which clients of various financial organizations were called.
Operators detected 189 cases of number substitution.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases there were restrictions on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department Artyom Sychev said that a broad spectrum of Russian banks had encountered phone number substitution.
He explained that operators do not always respond to Central Bank warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the lack of such an obligation in the law "On communication".
The bank Otkritie, Rosbank and Alfa Bank confirmed the information about the increased number of fraudulent phone calls with number substitution.
The Beeline press service said that some of the information about fraudulent phone calls, provided by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the list included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would cause a breakdown in the organization's work.
Artyom Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' phone numbers, which an operator will refer to in order to check the number of each call.
He explained that the creation of such a database requires legislative amendments.

In September Roskomnadzor found political advertising in the Google, Facebook and YouTube services.
According to the department's data, it occurred during the Russian elections of 8 December.
The State Duma committee was told of the violations.
Later Google said the company supports responsible political advertising.
In the opinion of staff, it is obliged to comply with the laws of the country.
The company Facebook noted that compliance with electoral legislation is the responsibility of the advertiser, and not the platform.
The head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov accused the companies of applying double standards in the placement of political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine's accession to NATO with Zelensky
Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership of the alliance at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary-general spoke of the discussions during his appearance at Columbia University in New York.
Answering a question regarding whether the issue was raised during their meeting, Stoltenberg said that they did actually discuss the question and also stressed that he did not set a time frame for Ukraine's entry.
According to him, any country that wanted to join the North Atlantic alliance had to meet certain requirements dictating concrete standards, RT reported.
Alternative to the NATO path suggested to Zelensky in Crimea
Instead of pursuing NATO accession the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky should work on establishing good neighborly relations with Russia.
The co-chair of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets spoke about this on Friday, 27 September.
"Sir president of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but heed the advice of [US president] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and improve relations with the president of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti journalists.
Chegrinets noted that he finds Zelensky to be a good actor, but a bad politician.
In his words, the Ukrainian president will be able to remain in power only if relations improve with Russia.
Earlier on 27 September the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the subject of the country's accession to the alliance.
In his words, for this Ukraine must fulfill certain conditions.
On 5 June Rada deputy Yevgeny Balitsky said that the possible accession of Ukraine to the alliance does not guarantee improved life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is coercing Neymar
Spanish club Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player Neymar are attempting to resolve a financial dispute, which arose after the striker's move to French club Paris Saint-Germain.
The matter almost reached the courts, but the Catalonians offered the player a resolution without the need for the courts' involvement.
Otherwise, they refused to allow his return.
Neymar and his astute father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, contrived an interesting maneuverer: according to the agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.
However, after literally one year, the forward moved to Paris Saint-Germain for a record 222 million euros.
Nonetheless, he received 22 million from the Catalonians and now wants to claim the remaining 18 million.
Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payments.
When Neymar's demands became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The club insists that the bonus is dependent on the entire contract being fulfilled – from 2016 to 2022.
As such, the club considers that the player is entitled to only one-quarter of the 40 million euros and demands the return of a portion of the first payment.
But most interestingly, Neymar and Barcelona almost agreed that the "prodigal" player would return to Catalonia's fold in summer.
But the agreement collapsed, however, hope remains that the forward will return.
Citing insiders, Sports.ru reports that the club's lawyers informed the player's representatives that if the financial demands are not settled out of court, then the Brazilian's return can be ruled out.
Neymar himself wants so strongly to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalonians will buy him back.
Mart Laar: EKRE members will not join the Bank of Estonia council
Members of EKRE have not been, nor will they be, invited to join the council.
Conclusions are drawn on the credibility of the Estonian state based on the composition of the Bank of Estonia's council.
As long as members of the EKRE continue to speak before they think, none of them will be invited to join the council.
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Eesti Pank cannot go and apologize for the statements made by members of the Supervisory Board," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, reported by the ERR information portal.
Laar noted, however, that EKRE is represented at Eesti Pank council meetings.
Beside Laar, the current, seventh composition of the council includes Liina Tonisson, Kaie Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Jaanus Tamkivi (Estonian Reform Party), Enn Listra and Rein Minka.
Laar is proposing to replace two member of the council - Tonisson and Kallo - in their place would be invited Enn Eesmaa (Estonian Centre Party) and Ivari Padar (Social Democratic Party).
Meanwhile, the Estonian Reform Party would like to see Jaanus Tamkivi replaced on the council by Andres Sutt.
In response to this, Laar said that the Estonian Reform Party's goal was to receive two seats on the Bank of Estonia's council - so that Andres Sutt joined the board in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi.
On Tuesday, September 24, Riigikogu declined Laar's proposal to invite new members to the Bank of Estonia's council.

The Russian MFA commented on the situation with the outrage caused by an episode of Andrei Malakhov's progam "Live," reports RIA Novosti.

"Andrei Malakhov's point of view is the opinion of a journalist, his personal view of the situation," the MFA said, noting that the incident does not affect Russian-Kyrgyzstani interstate relations.

How to increase your future pension and not overwork
Pension payments can be made by the Russian Pension Fund as well as by non-state pension funds.
NSPFs are private companies, reports Volgogradskaya pravda.ru.
They work like a deposit: you contribute money, the fund invests it and later returns it to you with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NSPFs on the Central Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules, which are established by federal laws.
Pension points can be purchased according to the law.
A shortfall in points is determined by how many years in the workforce you are lacking for pension eligibility.
This way suits those who worked unofficially.
Also, it is possible to make a contribution for a relative, for example, a homemaker wife.
Recommendations for those who start thinking about the pension at the start of their working life.
Larger pension payments are awarded to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who spent a certain number of years working in the Far North.
So that you don't have to refuse yourself anything when you reach pension age, provide for it in advance.
Purchase real estate, currency, securities, save money in deposits.
Most importantly – constantly raise your financial knowledge.

According to the RT Telegram channel, the journalists wore special protective gear and were there for less than five minutes, since the ruins of the reactor that was destroyed by the explosion still emit 40 thousand times more radiation than normal.
The disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant occurred the night of April 26, 1986.
12 regions of Ukraine and 23% of Belarus were subject to radiation pollution.
19 regions in Russia were affected.
This July, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order that led to the creation of a green corridor in Chernobyl, which is open to tourists.
The ban on photography in the exclusion zone has also been lifted.
It had been previously reported that the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exclusion zone was open to tourists on the Belorussian side.
The tour organizers pointed out that you could receive less radiation from one day in the zone than during an airplane flight.

People spent several days online discussing whether the rapper Guf is good enough to be the new Bachelor.
They remembered him for his numerous infidelities and antics with escorts, and they even decided that the musician wanted to thereby rehabilitate himself after the scandalous Moscow clip that received a record number of dislikes from listeners.
But the TNT management decided to put a stop to all the gossip at once.

Was there a show?
Thank you.
And to those who said that I would choke in the third round ...

Large-scale Facebook crash hits Europe.
Ukraine hit as well
A large-scale malfunction occurred in the Facebook social network in Europe.
Recall that before that, the social network "fell" on September 23.

Which club will take the released-on-parole Pavel Mamaev
Football player Pavel Mamaev, released from prison last week on parole, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The club's former midfielder could sign a contract with the Rostov football club in the near future, reports Chempionat.
According to the publication, negotiations between Rostov representatives and Mamaev are now in the final stage.
Presumably, the contract with the 31-year-old will be signed for two years with the possibility of extending it for another season.
Sport-Express writes that a day earlier, Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dinamo, but the check-up didn't happen because of the "uncertain situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated its contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of both parties.
The midfielder had played for Krasnodar since 2014.
He took bronze with the team twice in the Russian championships.
Mamaev previously played for Torpedo Moscow and CSKA Moscow.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played 15 matches for the Russian national team.
Mamaev was serving a sentence together with Zenit player Alexander Kokorin for participating in fights in the center of Moscow in October of last year.
They were released from prison on parole in mid-September.
Zenit signed a new contract with Kokorin.
Man with samurai sword tried to fight for cart found in trash pile
A resident of the American town Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he waved a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was rummaging in a trash pile near an uninhabited house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers who had come out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart in the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find and got upset.
He considered that he had a right to the cart, since he started rummaging in the trash first.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly Beavers seized the cart and ran away with it in the direction of his home.
Then Miller took a samurai sword that he had found in the same trash pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller withdrew the sword from its sheath and began to wave it at the cart snatcher.
Beavers told Miller that the scene was being videoed.
After noticing the video camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside.
Soon afterwards he saw an unfamiliar woman enter the yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
Police had already been searching for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was apprehended, and he was charged with attempted murder.
In September it was reported that in the American town Hardyston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a female stranger and injured her with a sword.
This was how he reacted when guests at a wedding, in the hotel where he was staying, would not let him smoke.
A riot of three
The longer the Moscow Case against participants of summer's protests proceeds, the more noticeably it splinters into separate fragments and loses its political scope.
The evidence confirming the "riots" does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to halt the case, a weak body of evidence does not necessarily lead to the accusations being withdrawn.
The collapse of the case should hearten society, but it will certainly leave the security services very exasperated – their efforts to bolster the case with defendants and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the case's three remaining defendants accused under Article 212 of the criminal code (rioting) – Alexei Minyailo – was unexpectedly released from custody without any conditions and in several hours’ time was exonerated: the Russian Investigative Committee withdrew the charges against him.
Minyailo had been under arrest for almost two months – several professional communities came to his defense: historians, priests, literary artists.
As a result, only two of those accused of taking part in a riot remain (at first there were 13 defendants): Sergei Fomin, transferred on September 3 to house arrest and Samariddin Radzhabov, who the day before had his arrest extended till the end of December (he is also accused of using force against government authorities, Article 318 of the criminal code).
Court sentences author of joke petition on accession of Latvia to US
The court of the Vidzeme Suburb of Riga has sentenced the author of a joke petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartetsky.
The man was given 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
"Common sense isn't the strongest side of our system", Bartetsky commmented on the court's decision.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on the accession of Latvia to the US was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the site also collected signatures on the accession of Latvia to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
A criminal case was initiated against Batetsky article 82, paragraph 1 of the country's criminal code—"A public apeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Latvian Republic".
Previously, the author of an internet petition on the accession of Latvia to Russia received half a year in prison in 2016.

Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes punishment for insulting the police online
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has prepared amendments to the law "On the Police", aimed at protecting officers from the spread of slanderous and defamatory information on the internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, while the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The document's explanatory memo notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of police officers from "the spread of information of a defamatory nature, including that of a discrediting nature, in information and communication networks, including on the internet".
It is not specified how exactly it intends to protect the police from slander online.
At the same time, the explanation on the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already provided for by the law on blocking posts offending government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into effect in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after the public discussions and an independent anti-corruption review.
According to the explanatory memo, the amendments to the law "On the Police" should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for "explicit disrespect for the government" on the internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor (the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to remove it.
A fine of 30 to 30,000 rubles is stipulated for the first violation, and repeated violations incur administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
Roskomnadzor applied this rule with regard to the media for the first time on April 12, blocking the Yaroslavl outlet 76.ru.
Soon thereafter, the Chudovo regional court of the Novgorod Oblast fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for publishing online "two notes with information in an unseemly form that offend human dignity and public morality and express clear disrespect for society, the state, and the bodies of executive state power in the Russian Federation".
Timeframe announced for lowering mortgage rate
Interest rates on housing loans in Russia will fall by the end of 2019.
This was announced by the CEO of the credit organization Dom.rf Alexander Plutnik, Interfax reports.
As Plutnik noted at the Russian Construction Ministry collegium, most banks will lower mortgage rates once more in the remaining months of the year, and the average market indicator will reach 8.9 percent – the level envisaged in the Housing and Urban Environment national project.
According to the passport of the project, in 2019 the average mortgage interest rate in 2019 should be 8.9 percent, in 2021 – 8.5 percent, by 2024 – 7.9 percent.
The program provides for "ensuring affordable housing for average-income families, including by creating the possibility of acquisition (construction of housing by them using mortgage credit, the interest rate of which should be below 8 percent)".
Earlier in September it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market – Sberbank – plans one more housing loan interest rate cut by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens prolong youth?
Phytoandrogens have hardly been studied.
The most well-known is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been studied quite thoroughly and demonstrate positive effects on the body.
They lower the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular disease and several forms of cancer).
Well known sources of phytoestrogens include all types of beans (the most popular being soy), hops, and flax seed.
However, many professionals believe such dietary supplements can't entirely replace natural hormones.
Don't dismiss the potential danger of such supplements.
For example, taking them can lower the production of natural hormones because too many substitutes enter the body externally.
Veretennikov called for the revival of Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
The former Rotor striker and Russian national team member Oleg Veretennikov has joined calls for the return of Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
The Astana club, which was in previous years called Dinamo, Tselinnik, Astana and Zhenis, was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov played for the team in 2004 and 2008.
"I heard how fans organized a movement to revive the Zhenis football club.
And I could not ignore it!
I spent 1 1/2 seasons with the club.
This was not the best time in terms of results or financing, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans, who always stuck by the team!
I will always remember the Munaitpasov Stadium at which I scored my 200th career goal.
Zhenis should return!
It has a rich history and wonderful fans.
I wish them the very best and believe that the authorities will return their hometown club," wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

Hydrometcenter of Russia lists examples of folk wisdom that are correct
Russia has a lot of folk sayings that people use to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, they do not all work.
Hydrometcenter of Russia checked all the examples of folk wisdom that supposedly work.
The meteorologists concluded that only two of them can be genuinely trusted and only when it concerns the near future.
Roman Vilfand, scientific director at Hydrometcenter of Russia, said that if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be fair, as our ancestors observed.
And if the heavens shine with a pale light, then the next day will be rainy.
The second functioning piece of wisdom is based on bird observations.
People often say of swallows that if they are flying low that usually means rain.
This can be explained simply - when there is high humidity the gnats' wings become wet and the birds are forced to fly lower in order to catch them, TASS reported.
Different continents have their own folk wisdom.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the US and Canada, where it is marked every February 2.
On this day, the groundhog should be observed as it crawls out of its burrow to determine when spring will arrive.
Mystery oil spill discovered on the beaches of northeastern Brazil
An oil spill of unknown origin has been discovered on 99 beaches in northeast Brazil.
Polluted areas stretch 2,000 kilometers along the shoreline.
Reports of oil spills first began appearing on September 2.
The number of reports, as well as the area affected, has continued to grow with each day through to Thursday.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources conducted an analysis of the samples that have been found.
The samples were all revealed to be identical‚ — crude oil.
State-run oil firm Petrobras, which analyzed the samples, announced that their composition did not correspond to oil recovered from deposits on Brazilian territory.
"This is heavy oil.
It could have been released by a ship after its tanks were cleaned.
Many continue to do this.
Most likely it found its way into the ocean currents," Rogério Almeida, coordinator for the oil workers union in the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He added that despite a ban on the practice, many ships continue to dump waste into the open sea.
Nine sea turtles completely covered in a layer of oil were discovered by environmental workers on beaches in four out of eight states in the northeast of the country.
Only two of them could be saved.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources together with Petrobras is set to begin cleaning the polluted beaches in the coming days.
Meanwhile, the institute's specialists recommend that tourists and local residents avoid the oil spills and report any pollution discovered.
Medvedev ordered a review of the regulations for food service enterprises
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Justice Ministry, the Economics Ministry and the Industry and Trade Ministry together with the business ombudsmen and the entrepreneurial community to revise the sanitary-epidemiological rules and regulations for food service organizations.
Also they must look into the issue of switching to applying the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union's technical regulations to the organization of food service.
The agencies must present their proposals to the government no later than 15 October, as stated in the list of Mr. Medvedev's orders according to the Dialog program which screened on 11 September on the TV channel Rossiya 24.
By that deadline Mr. Medvedev ordered all the aforementioned agencies, except the Justice Ministry, to present proposals for conducting an experiment in restricting monitoring activities for food service organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region, starting from 1 January 2020.
The Justice Ministry and Economics Ministry have been ordered to submit a draft law to the government with amendments to the Administrative Code on applying an administrative suspension of activity for food service rule violations that harmed health.
Also, the Labor Ministry, Economics Ministry, Rospotrebnadzor and the Finance Ministry must work on the issue of gradually switching to forming the consumer basket based on a basic set of foodstuffs needed for a balanced diet, starting from 2021.
To recap, the business community raised the issue of outdated regulations after the closure of a cafe in the AnderSon chain.
The business community demanded that the sanitary rules be overturned, and Rospotrebnadzor announced that new ones would be jointly developed.
33 agencies were included in the list
In addition Rospotrebnazor intends to reduce the number of sanitary regulations and rules to a 40th of their current number.

The man operated in the Skuratovsky neighborhood of Tula.
He stole batteries and vehicle audio equipment from cars.
From two vehicles – a VAZ-2106 and a VAZ-2107 – he took the batteries, presumably for the purpose of selling them.

A 26-year-old unemployed person is in custody.
Russians have nothing to save for retirement according to V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko believes Russians don't have enough savings for the bill on guaranteed pension product to fully work in the country.
The practice of supplementing pensions through personal savings is quite popular throughout the world.
How timely its introduction is here is another matter.
"In my view, a considerable part of the population has an income now that simply leaves them nothing to set aside for increasing their pensions in the future", stated V. Matvienko.
The Speaker believes that Russians can't understand how pensions are formed and calculated, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them".
"That doesn't mean I'm against improving the pension system and its regulatory legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve pension sizes and citizens' social security.
"But our steps in this direction should be thoughtful and responsible, taking domestic realities into account", V. Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council emphasized that if this initiative (the bill on guaranteed pension product) develops, then several basic principles must be specified, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and state responsibility for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Russian Ministry of Finance announced the submission of the bill on guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.
Its basic elements include the exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee by the state of the safety of citizens' long-term pension savings, the registration of citizens' savings accounts by a central administrator, tax exemptions for businesses, and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remaining in the Marvel movie universe.
Sony and Disney come to agreement
News of the beloved superhero's departure from the Marvel movie universe angered many loyal fans.
Spider-Man, one of the most famous comic book characters, will remain in the Marvel movie universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to reach an agreement on the rights to use him in the franchise's films.
This was announced in a Sony press release stating that the third Spider-Man film with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Spider-Man would leave the Marvel movie universe because Disney and Sony Pictures couldn't come to an agreement on the division of revenue.
Sony owns the rights to the movie hero.
It leased them out for Marvel films, which belong to Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from the box office, and Disney collected revenue from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point this situation was no longer suitable for Disney, and the company wanted to reexamine the agreement.
The president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, said that he's excited.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey in the Marvel movie universe will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very glad to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
He's a hero whose story touches every generation and audiences around the world," reads the press release.
At the same time, Feige noted that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe built around Spider-Man.
"He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes.
As Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold," he said.
Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted a quote from the film Wolf of Wall Street on his Instagram account, where the hero Leonardo DiCaprio shouts, "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the conflict between the companies appeared in August.
As the media reported, Disney wanted to take half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay half the cost of producing the pictures.
But this did not suit Sony.
News of the possibility of the beloved superhero leaving the Marvel movie universe angered many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have yet to be disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have worked well together over the past four years, and our common desire to continue working together was in line with that of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are glad that we can move forward together."
The film Avengers: Endgame, which united Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk, and other Marvel superheroes, was the highest-grossing in world cinematic history, replacing Avatar.

Everything is permitted in the third round.

Congress sees "Russian influence" in Trump's talks with Zelensky
The lower house of the US Congress has accused Russia of involvement in a scandal arising from a telephone conversation between White House head Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
MSNBC News reports that House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that "Russians" may somehow be behind the episode.
"I think that Russia had a hand in this," said the Democrat, while refraining from further comment.
Headed by Pelosi, the Democrats, who hold a majority in the house, earlier announced the launch of impeachment proceeding against the president.
This comes after a complaint by an intelligence informer against Trump.
The informer suspected that during a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine open a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, who may become Trump's adversary in the elections scheduled for one year's time.
The White House had to provide congress members and the general public with a transcript of the controversial conversation.

An expert told why it's worth giving up teabags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found out that when a teabag steeps in a cup more than 10 billion microplastic particles are released in five minutes.
Dust particles may also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, a consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea – the producer can add ingredients that will not be shown on the packaging.
The dust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it may end up in the tea.
"Furthermore, teabags don't always contain specifically tea plants," Tikhonova said.
In her words, it is best to reject that drink in favor of tea by weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
Also, she emphasized that in addition to its composition, the danger of packaged tea is also in how it is made – microparticles are heated to high temperatures, causing them to start to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea – this drink will have less additives," the expert recommended.

Regions asked to share business support secrets
According to Parlamentskaya Gazeta, on 27 September the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrey Kutepov wrote to the Minister for Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov with a proposal to state a position in regard to the federal subjects' initiative for improving legislation in the sphere of support for small and medium-sized entreprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy has collated all the information received from the regions about current programs to develop business and legalize the self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their correspondence the regions told the senators about SME development problems and submitted proposals for the improvement of current legislation.
"At present communications between regions is insufficiently developed, as a result of which the entrepreneur community in all regions visited by senators emphasized the issue of the lack of information about regional development programs for entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," stated Andrey Kutepov.
In a supplement to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a summary of positive work by the regions in legalizing self-employment, and combined data from the regions with proposals and problematics (at the editorial office's disposal).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the combined data from the regions was sent to regional government leaders.
The exchange of information about positive initiatives implemented in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship overall.
The first step towards such an exchange will be sharing the information that the Council of Economic Policy has," the senator told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
Useful experience
Support programs for small and medium-sized business have been adopted and are successfully functioning in many regions of the country at present.
For example, the Center of Entrepreneurship Support is operating in Vologda region, providing financial support and assisting businesspeople with product certification.
In Ivanov region a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the single-window principle through a multifunctional center.
In Krasnodar Krai, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are offered grants from the krai budget.
A cluster development center is functioning in Oryol region.
As part of the "Acceleration of SMEs" federal project, Amur region is providing for the possibility to subsidize business incubators created on the foundation of non-state co-working centers, with funding from the federal budget.
Special measures to support youth entrepreneurship are being adopted in a number of other regions.
The self-employed are continuing to come out of the shadows
In the opinion of regional governments, a number of changes should be made to current legislation in order to provide more effective support for small and medium-sized business.
For example, Arkhangelsk region proposed changing the term "self-employment" to "entrepreneurial activity", since it "best corresponds to the content of state services promoting self-employment to unemployed citizens".
Ivanovo region considers it necessary to introduce amendments providing for expanding the list of types of activity performed by self-employed citizens, including types of activity in fitting out and renovating residential properties, dacha construction, fitness training.
Bryansk region believes it is important to tighten control over unscrupulous producers of dairy products, using the Mercury veterinary system.
And Kostroma and Magadan regions are advocating for legal and statutory recognition of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and efforts to support social entrepreneurship.
All the proposals from the regions will be considered in the preparation of state programs to support SMEs, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of draft legislation.
"All proposals from the regions will be considered in the preparation of state programs to support SMEs, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of draft legislation," Andrey Kutepov said.
An airline has helped passengers avoid being seated next to crying babies
Air carrier Japan Airlines (JAL) has unveiled a new service: passengers can find out where small children will be seated when booking tickets.
If desired, passengers can now avoid being seated next to them.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers now can use the new service to avoid these undesirable seats next to small children.
The air carrier unveiled a service that tracks which spots will seat children.
Passengers will be shown an image of a child's head on seats that are occupied by children aged from eight days to two years when selecting a place in the cabin while booking a ticket.
As a result, people who do not want to fly next to kids because of the possible inconvenience due to their crying can be seated as far away as possible from them.
Internet users who use the airline's services were overjoyed at the new option.
Several of them thanked the air carrier, remarking that other airlines should follow suit.
One user complained that several weeks ago while flying from New York to Doha three crying babies were seated directly next to them.
Another person suggested that "adult-only flights" should be introduced, adding that they would be prepared to pay more for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would always try to choose Japan Airlines for their journeys, as they could see no good coming from being seated next to a crying baby in an enclosed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with an infant tried to win over her fellow passengers during a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared small bags of sweets with apology notes for every one of the 200 passengers.

Pavel Ustinov joins pickets in support of defendants in "Moscow Case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of individual "Freedom For All" pickets held on Friday at the Russian presidential administration building on the Old Square in Moscow, reports an Interfax correspondent.
The series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
The protesters are currently taking turns standing and holding posters with the inscription "Freedom For All" and the last names of those convicted and arrested after uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
Besides Ustinov, the posters had the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Daniel Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantine Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aidar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minyailo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Edward Malyshevsky, and Vladislav Sinitsa.
On September 16, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced the 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a penal colony on charges of violence against a riot police officer at an uncoordinated rally on August 3 in the center of Moscow (part 2, article 318 of the Russian criminal code).
Then, on September 20, by request of the Prosecutor General, the court changed Ustinov's sentence from detention in custody to recognizance.
The petition for Ustinov's release gathered more than 112 thousand signatures in a day.
Theater and film artists started a flash mob in support of their colleague.
People lined up to participate in the picket as a sign of solidarity with the actor on September 18 on the Old Square.
Human rights activists, journalists, scholars, teachers, doctors, and Orthodox priests demanded that the case be reviewed.
As Ustinov's sister Julia reported to Interfax, her brother does not plan to speak at the meeting in support of the defendants of the "Moscow Case" on September 29 in the capital.
Deliveries of sanctioned foodstuffs to Russia fall to 1 percent of previous levels.
The Russian government has calculated that the deliveries to Russia of agricultural produce and foodstuffs from countries falling under Russia's food embargo have shrunk to 1 percent of their 2013 levels.
According to the report provided to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of foodstuffs were imported from sanctioned countries compared with 3.4422 million tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reported.
The value of imported foodstuffs fell to $226.5 million from $4.9755 billion, respectively.
This refers to the supply of goods that was not subject to the embargo.
The report showed that the falling volumes of prohibited foodstuffs were compensated for by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the rule dictating the destruction of agricultural produce, staples and foodstuffs that are forbidden for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, states that the rule was extended for a further year – from December 31, 2019, until December 31, 2020.
At first, the regulation on the destruction of embargoed foodstuffs applied to produce from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein "joined" the list – from January 1, 2016, Ukraine was added.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported embargoed goods (products that fall under the foodstuffs embargo put in place by Moscow in response to West's anti-Russian sanctions), came into force in 2015.
Furthermore, the government authorized the destruction of sanctioned goods using any legal method.
In response to the West's continued sanctions, Russia also extended its counter measures.
The measures, however, do not extend to foodstuffs that citizens import for their own personal use.
The ban does not apply to goods for personal use weighing under 5 kilograms.
The head of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier referred to the destruction of food products as "simply immoral" and by his account, it negatively influenced peoples' development.
Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing came out in support of efforts to destroy edible foodstuffs.

Construction of billion-euro telescope begins in Chile
This is reported by TASS citing the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
ESO says that this week construction officially began on the dome of the building that is to house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), currently the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project.
Its overall cost, according to ESO estimations, exceeds a billion euros.
A large part of this money will be spent making the equipment and constructing the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is the record-setting large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will consist of 798 hexagonal 1.4-meter segments.
This huge mirror, and also two supplementary reflective surfaces 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help the E-ELT obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth twins.
Researchers will also try to use this observatory to view the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive back hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have already been developing the mirrors, research instruments and other components of the observatory for three years – from the moment when the first plans to build the E-ELT were announced.
The contract to produce the main mirror, the total cost of which was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
