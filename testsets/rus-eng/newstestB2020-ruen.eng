The coordinator of Navalny's Arkhangelsk headquarters sentenced to community service
An Oktyabrsky district court in Arkhangelsk issued a verdict for the coordinator of Alexei Navalny's regional headquarters, Andrei Borovikov.
He was sentenced to 400 hours of community service, for repeatedly violating the law on conducting protests (Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, otherwise known as the Dadinsky article), a Kommersant journalist reported from the court.
The case was opened in April of this year for organizing a protest against the construction of a landfill in the Arkhangelsk region.
The first person to be convicted under Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation was activist Ildar Dadin, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment in 2015.
On the day before sentencing, September 26, negotiations were held between both parties at the court.
The prosecution insisted on three years of community service.
In my case, pre-trial restrictions included a supervised release, which entailed a ban on attending large-scale public gatherings and communicating with the organizers of the April 7 protests.
"The entire time I wore an electronic band and base.
They tracked me using them.
My movements were not restricted.
I recently flew back from Moscow, where I underwent training," said Andrei Borovikov.
After the sentence was announced, the coordinator of Navalny's regional headquarters announced that he would be serving his sentence in Arkhangelsk.
On September 27, Communist Party Duma member Sergei Shargunov introduced a bill to the State Duma reducing in severity Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
Representatives of the Communist Party, the Liberal Democrats and A Just Russia told Kommersant that they intended to support the initiative.
Pavel Mogilevets: "Everyone in Rubin must think about the reasons for unsuccessful matches".
Rubin halfback Pavel Mogilevets spoke about the reasons for the team's unsuccessful games.
The Kazanians suffered four losses in a row in the Russian championship and were eliminated from the Cup.
We psych up for every game, Izvestia quotes Mogilevets as saying.
Therefore every one of us must think about the reasons for such unsuccessful matches.
More meetings are ahead – we must prepare for them and rectify the situation.
How?
If we knew, then probably we would have already rectified it.
But first of all, it seems to me, we have to add such a component as one-on-one combat.
In my view, we have problems with that.
Kremlin supports smoking ban on balconies of residential buildings
The Kremlin supports any measures that will help save lives, said presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the smoking ban on apartment balconies and loggias.
The Cabinet of Ministers earlier approved changes to fire safety rules, according to which it is forbidden to use open fire on the balconies and in the rooms of residential buildings.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that this includes, among other things, a ban on smoking on the balconies and loggias of apartments and hotels.
The changes will come into effect on October 1, 2019.
Violations are subject to administrative liability.
The Kremlin has a positive attitude towards any solutions that help save human lives.
“We know how many fires occur, and many of them have very tragic consequences and resonate with the public.
Therefore, any life saved justifies such decisions”, said Peskov.
First of all, the press secretary evaluates this as a fire-prevention measure, not as a means of protecting neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and supports a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes US’s adoption of TAIPEI Act
China has come out strongly against the US’s adoption of the so-called TAIPEI Act, which seriously violates the One-China policy and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiques.
This was stated on Friday by Ma Xiaoguang, the official representative of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China.
The approval of this bill by the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations is also a serious violation of international rights and the basic principles of international relations and is gross interference in China’s internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguang said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues are part of China’s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, to immediately cease promoting the relevant negative bills, and to immediately cease interfering in the Taiwan issue, in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations, and also peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguang emphasized.
TikTok hides objectionable videos from users
According to TikTok’s data, its number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are younger than 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, the Guardian reports.
The documents at the outlet’s disposal reveal that the owner of TikTok (the company ByteDance) is using the app to promote China’s foreign policy goals abroad.
The majority of the violations pertaining to Chinese policy falls under “incitement of hatred.”
In each case, TikTok puts the objectionable publications in a context complying with the general rules, so the social network's actions won’t look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticizing China’s socialist system falls under the general ban on “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning the incident on Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the “falsification of the history of China or other countries.”
The document also provides a list of twenty names of “foreign leaders or state figures” that are banned, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Banned material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are deleted by the social network’s administrators and may result in the user being blocked.
Less severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their reach is limited by TikTok’s algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer used: “We use a localized approach for moderation now, and we engage independent local specialists”.
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says Production Center co-founder Rustem Bogdanov.
Production Center is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All of Production Center’s bloggers’ advertising materials are coordinated with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be published without coordination, says Bogdanov.
To the question of whether it’s possible to talk about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov answers positively and says he has seen such posts.
The founder of the Our Digital agency Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are enumerated in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on.”
But these rules can be applied to any content the moderators don’t like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripov’s agency is another of TikTok’s Russian partners.
According to TikTok’s data, its number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are younger than 18.
According to the user agreement, only people older than 13 can use TikTok.
The social network’s administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: Neuronet analyzes their faces and determines how old the person looks, says Bogdanov.
If Neuronet decides the user is younger, his account could be deleted, he adds.
According to RBK, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow at the WeWork co-working space.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
The number of calls from scammers spoofing banks' telephone numbers is increasing in Russia.
This was reported by Kommerstant with reference to information from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator passed information to communications operators about more than 2.5 thousand numbers that clients of various financial organizations were called from.
In 189 cases, operators discovered a spoofed number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases, restrictions were placed on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Central Bank's Department of Information Safety, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks encountered spoofed numbers.
He explained that operators don't always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the lack of such requirement in the law "On Communications".
Otkritie, Rosbank, and Alfa-Bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls from spoofed numbers.
According to the Beeline press service, some of the information about fraudulent calls that was passed on by the Central Bank was incorrect: the list included numbers that banks actually use to communicate with clients.
Blocking them would lead to a breakdown in the organizations' work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of scammer numbers that communications operators will use to check the number of every call.
He explained that legislative amendments are required to create such a database.

Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine's entry into NATO with Zelensky
Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership of the alliance at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary-general spoke of this during his appearance at Columbia University in New York.
Answering a question regarding whether the issue was raised during their meeting, Stoltenberg said that they did actually discuss the question and also stressed that he did not set a time frame for Ukraine's entry.
According to him, any country that wanted to join the North Atlantic alliance had to meet certain requirements dictating concrete standards, RT television reported.
An alternative to NATO membership was proposed to Zelensky in Crimea
Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky would be better off working on neighborly relations with Russia rather than a NATO membership bid.
Roman Cherginets, co-chairman of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples in the Republic of Crimea, made the suggestion on Friday, September 27.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistake of his predecessor, he should take the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, who he listened to with a sour expression, and fix relations with the president of Russia," Cherginets told a RIA Novosti journalist.
Cherginets said that he considers Zelensky a good actor but a bad politician.
He considers that the Ukrainian president will only remain in power if relations with Russia are repaired.
Earlier, on September 27, Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg announced that he had held talks with Zelensky on the country's membership bid for the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine had to meet certain requirements for this.
On June 5, Rada member Yevgeny Balitsky said that Ukraine's possible membership in the alliance would not guarantee an improvement in the country's standard of living.
Money more important than football.
Barcelona blackmails Neymar
Spain’s Barcelona and its former football player the Brazilian Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker’s move to France’s Paris Saint-Germain.
The matter almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they are refusing to take him back.
Neymar and his astute father, who is also the Brazilian’s agent, masterminded an interesting deal: according to the agreement with “Barca”, which the payer signed in 2016, he was supposed to get 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian’s lawyers are insisting that the club also owes him interest for late payments.
When the Catalonia capital found out about Neymar’s claims, Barcelona sent a counter claim.
The Blue-Crimson are insisting that the bonus was based on the fulfillment of the entire contract—from 2016 to 2022.
Thus, the club believes the player was only entitled to a quarter of the 40 million euros and is demanding the return of a prorated part of the first payment.
But most interestingly, in the summer Neymar and “Barca” nearly agreed on the return of the “prodigal” player to the Catalonia fold.
However, the deal fell through, but hope remains for the forward’s return.
Then, as reports Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the club’s lawyers told the player’s representatives that if the question of financial claims is not settled out of court, it will rule out the possibility of the Brazilian’s return.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for a guarantee that the Catalans will buy him back.
Mart Laar: EKRE members will not join the Bank of Estonia supervisory board
EKRE members were not and will not be invited onto the supervisory board
By the composition of the Bank of Estonia supervisory board, conclusions can be drawn about trust in the Estonian state.
While such conduct is maintained among EKRE members in which they speak first and think later, none of them will be invited onto the bank council.
"The chair of the Bank of Estonia supervisory board cannot make apologies for statements by board members," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, the broadcast portal ERR reports.
At the same time Laar noted that EKRE is represented at Eesti Pank council sessions.
Besides Laar, the current seventh composition of the Bank of Estonia supervisory board includes Liina Tõnisson, Kaie Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Jaanus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Enn Listra and Rein Minka.
Laar proposes replacing two members of the board – Kallo and Tõnisson – in place of them Laar proposed Enn Eesmaa (Center Party) and Ivari Padar (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Sutt to join the board instead of Jaanus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the Reform Party's goal was to get two places on the Bank of Estonia supervisory board – so that Andres Sutt would join the board in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members to the Bank of Estonia supervisory board.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on a scandal in Kyrgyzstan resulting from Malakhov's show
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the indignation arising from the latest edition of Andrei Malakhov's Pryamoi Efir program, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.
Earlier, a Russian diplomat was summoned to the Kyrgyz Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the program was aired.

In response to demands for an apology to the Kyrgyz people, Malakhov said that his words were simply his personal opinion.
Russia's diplomatic service clarified that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not summon Russian diplomats – it was an earlier planned working visit during which, among other issues, the television presenter's statements were discussed.
"Andrei Malakhov's point of view is the journalist's opinion, his personal view on the situation," stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noting that the incident would not influence international relations between the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan.

The official spoke about this in a comment on the Pod’em Telegram channel.

The driver managed to jump out of the cab, thereby saving his life.
The incident occurred on the morning of September 27 in the peninsula’s Bakhchysarai region.

Parents trust you with their child.

“Together with you, they learn about the world around them, the beauty of nature, of music, of poetry, they learn independence, and the ability to communicate and make friends,” said the government Chairman.
According to the Prime Minister, a child’s character is formed and his abilities are revealed thanks to teachers.
Medvedev is certain that the future of children depends precisely on teachers.
“That is why developing pre-school education, improving its quality, building modern kindergartens, and materially supporting pre-school employees are priority tasks of the state social policy, which the ‘Demography’ national project is aimed at solving”, the head of government said.

How to increase future pension without overworking
Not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-governmental pension funds can pay pensions.
The NPF is a group of private companies, reports Volgogradskaya Pravda.ru.
They work like a deposit: you make inpayments and the fund invests them and returns the money to you with interest over time.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about the NPF on the site of the Bank of Russia.
All of the funds work under the same rules established by federal law.
Pension points can be bought by law.
The number of deficient points depends on how many years of experience you are lacking to accrue a pension.
This method suits those who worked unofficially.
Moreover, you can make a contribution for a relative, for example, a housewife.
This is recommended for those who think about their pension at the beginning of their career.
Civil service employees, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers, and people who worked a certain number of years in the regions of the Far North receive increased pension payments.
In order not to miss out on anything as you reach pensioner age, take care of this in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, bonds, and set money aside for deposits.

A video, which appeared on the Internet and was first published on YouTube by the video agency Ruptly, showed the control room of the fourth power unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
As part of a presentation of a guide to the exclusion zone, 15 members of the press were provided access to Chernobyl's fourth control room.
RT's Telegram channel reported that the journalists, dressed in special protective suits, were only there for less than 5 minutes as the radiation levels remain at 40,000 times the norm in the ruins of the power-generating unit that was wrecked in the explosion.
The Chernobyl accident took place on the night of April 26, 1986.
Twelve regions of Ukraine and 23 percent of Belarus were affected by radiation pollution.
Nineteen regions of Russia were contaminated.
In June of this year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree designating the Chernobyl zone a green corridor open for tourists.
A ban on filming in the zone was canceled.
It was reported earlier that the Belarusian Chernobyl exclusion zone was opened for tourists.
The excursion organizers stressed that a day spent in the zone would result in a radiation dose less than received during an airplane flight.

Television channel TNT decided that rapper Guf is not good enough for its Kholostyak television show
The question of whether rapper Guf is good enough to be the new Bachelor has been a point of discussion on the Internet for several days.

This is a real man.
All respect to him.
I wish him success in the future.

Was it a show?
Thank you.
And to those who said that I run out of breath in the third round...

Which club will sign Pavel Mamayev after his release on parole
Football player Pavel Mamayev, who was released from prison on parole last week, will not be returning to the Krasnodar club.
The former Krasnodar halfback may soon sign a contract with the Rostov football club, the Chempionat portal reported.
According to the portal, negotiations between Rostov representatives and Mamayev are in their final stages.
According to reports, a contract with the 31-year-old player will be signed for two years with the option to extend it for a further season.
Sport-Ekspress reported that a day earlier, Pavel Mamayev was to undergo a medical at Moscow club Dinamo, but the examination did not take place due to the "uncertain situation at the club."
Krasnodar annulled its contract with Mamayev last week upon mutual agreement.
The halfback has played with the Krasnodar club since 2014.
Together with the club he twice won bronze in the Russian championships.
Prior to that, Mamayev played with Moscow clubs Torpedo and TsSKA.

Man with samurai sword tries to defend cart found in trash heap
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in a fight over a shopping cart found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a trash heap near an empty house.
Todd Beavers noticed it while out on an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the garbage.
Miller saw Beaver’s discovery and became upset.
He decided he could claim the cart, since he started digging in the trash first.
The men began to argue.
Beavers suddenly grabbed the cart and ran towards his house with it.
Then Miller took a samurai sword he found in the same heap and began to run after his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his home.
Miller drew the sword from its sheath and started swinging it at the cart thief.
Beavers told Miller that what was happening was being video recorded.
Having noticed the video camera, Miller took off, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Soon after, he saw an unknown woman come into his yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already searching for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and injured her with a sword in Hardyston, New Jersey.
He thus reacted to the fact that guests at a wedding being celebrated at the same hotel where he was staying didn’t give him a light.
Mass protests of three
The further the “Moscow case” against the participants in the summer protests goes, the more noticeably it splinters into pieces and loses its political content.
The evidence concerning the “mass riots” does not hold up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to drop the case, the weak body of evidence does not necessarily lead to the charges being dropped.
The dissolution of the case would probably inspire society, but it is sure to leave the security forces extremely irritated, as their efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence turned out to be futile.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under article 212 of the criminal code (mass riots), Alexei Minyailo, was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and was completely rehabilitated a few hours later: the Investigative Committee of Russia dropped the charges against him.
Minyailo was held under arrest for nearly two months, and several professional communities immediately went to bat for him: historians, priests, and writers.
After that, only two remained charged with participating in mass riots in the case (initially there were 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was placed under house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Rajabov, whose arrest was extended by the court until the end of December the day before (he is also accused of using force against a government official, article 318 of the criminal code).
A court sentenced the author of a joke petition on the accession of Latvia to the USA
The Vidzeme district court of Riga sentenced the author of a joke petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States of America Denis Bartetsky.
It is noted that the man was sentenced to 80 hours of community service and a year of probation.
"Common sense is not our system's strongest side," Bartetsky commented on the court's decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
Signature collection on the accession of Latvia to USA was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition on the site signatures were collected on the accession of Latvia to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the Solar System and Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was opened against Bartetsky under the first point of the 82nd article of the country's Criminal Law – "Public call to destroy the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Previously in 2016 the author of an internet petition on the accession of Latvia to Russia was sentenced to a half-year of prison.
A Japanese airliner was forced to make an emergency landing in Khabarovsk
A Boeing aircraft flying from Austria to Japan made an emergency landing at an airport in Khabarovsk, the TASS news agency reported.
Two hundred and six people, including 12 crew members, were on board the All Nippon Airways airplane.
There were no reported casualties.
A separate plane was sent from Tokyo for the passengers to continue their journey.
The cause of the incident was a fall in oil pressure in one of the aircraft's engines, the agency reported a Khabarovsk airport spokesperson as saying.
It was reported earlier that an aircraft flying from Moscow region airport Zhukovsky to Kirghizia made an emergency landing in a Samara airport due to an ill child onboard.
Russian MVD proposes punishment for insulting police on the internet
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has prepared amendments to the law "On Police" to protect law enforcement officers from the distribution of information on the internet that is slanderous or harms their dignity.
On Friday a proposal for public discussion of the draft legislation appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, while the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory memorandum for the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to defend the dignity and honor of police from "the distribution in information-communication networks, including in the internet, of information that is slanderous or defamatory".
How exactly it proposes to protect police from slander is not specified.
The document's explanation says that the amendment provisions will be applied "by individual means", already provided for by the law on blocking posts that insult the authorities, and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the draft legislation will be published after a public discussion and independent anticorruption evaluation.
According to the explanatory memorandum, amendments to the law "On Police" should come into force in January 2020.
On 18 March President Vladimir Putin signed the law on punishment for "blatant disrespect for the state" online.
According to this document, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media warns an information source about a violation and gives it 24 hours to remove it.
For a first violation it provides for a fine from 30 to 300 thousand rubles, and up to 15 days' administrative arrest for a repeat violation.
On 12 April the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media applied this regulation to the mass media for the first time, blocking the Yaroslavl publication 76.ru.
Soon afterwards the Novgorod region's Chudov regional court fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for placing on the internet "two posts with indecent information that insults human dignity and public morals and expresses blatant disrespect for the Russian state and authorities".
Term for reducing mortgage rates announced
Housing loan rates in Russia will decrease before the end of 2019.
This was announced by the General Director of the Dom.rf credit organization Alexander Plutnik, reports Interfax.
As Plutnik noted at a collegium of the Russian Ministry of Construction, the majority of banks will conduct one more cycle of reducing mortgage rates in the remaining months of the year, and the average market index will reach 8.9 percent—the level designated by the national project “Housing and Urban Environment”.
According to the project passport, in 2019 the mortgage average should be 8.9 percent, in 2021—8.5 percent, and by 2024—7.9 percent.
The program provides for “providing affordable housing for middle-income families, including creating opportunities for purchasing (building housing with a mortgage loan, which should have a rate of less than 8 percent)”.
It became known earlier in September that one of the biggest players in the Russian mortgage market—Sberbank—plans to hold one more reduction in housing loan rates by the end of 2019.
Could phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
Phytoandrogens have been poorly studied.
Pine pollen is one of the most famous.
Phytoestrogens have been researched fairly well and produce a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with aging (including cardiovascular disease and several forms of cancer).
Well-known sources of phytoestrogens are legumes (the most popular of which is soya), hops and linseed.
Many specialists consider that these nutritional supplements cannot fully replace natural hormones.
It cannot be excluded that such supplements could cause harm.
For example, the production of one's own natural hormones may fall when taking them, given that the body is receiving too much externally sourced analogous substances.
Veretennikov called for revival of Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
Former Rotor striker and Russian national team member Oleg Veretennikov joined the campaign for the revival of Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
The club from Astana, which in different years was called Dinamo, Tselinnik, Astana and Zhenis, was dissolved in 2014.
Veretennikov played for the team in 2004 and 2008.
"I found out about the campaign to revive the football club Zhenis, organized by its supporters.
And I cannot stay on the sidelines!
I spent one and a half seasons with this club.
They were not the very best times in terms of results and financing, but I will never forget this club and its devoted supporters, who were always together with the team!
Forever in my memory will be the Munaitpasov stadium, where I scored the 200th goal of my career!
Zhenis must rise again!
It has an enormous history and wonderful supporters.
I wish them all the very best and believe that the city authorities will return them their native club!" Veretennikov wrote on Instagram.
Bastion complex launched Onyx rocket in Chukotka
The Defense Ministry has launched a cruise missile from a Bastion complex in Chukotka for the first time.
The Onyx launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, 200 of which were over dry land, which is a record for this type of rocket.
Safety for the launch was provided by about 10 warships and vessels of the Pacific fleet, as well as marine aircraft, reported the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.
Bastion complexes were never used in Chukotka before.
Hydrometeorological Center said which weather lore sayings are true
In Russia there are many folklore sayings that people use to predict the weather.
But unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the sayings that supposedly work.
The meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, although only in the short term.
According to the scientific supervisor of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, Roman Vilfand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will truly be fine, as our ancestors observed.
And if the sky glowed palely, then on the next day there will be rain.
The second saying that works is based on bird observations.
Most often it is said of swallows, if they are flying low, then usually there will be rain.
There's a simple explanation – when the level of moisture in the air is high, gnats' wings get wet and birds have to go lower to hunt for insects, TASS reports.
Different continents have their own folk sayings.
Groundhog day is a traditional folk holiday in the USA and Canada, marked annually on 2 February.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to observe a groundhog emerging from its burrow to determine when spring will come.
Unidentified oil spill discovered on beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches of north-east Brazil.
Patches of pollution were spread over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Messages about the first-found oil spills started arriving on 2 September.
But with each day right up to Thursday their number, as well as the territorial spread, continued to grow.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of retrieved samples.
It turned out that they are all the same and that it is specifically crude oil.
The state oil company Petrobras, which was given the found samples for analysis, announced that in their composition they do not match the oil extracted from fields on the territory of Brazil.
"It is thick oil.
It might have been dumped from one of the ships after its tanks were cleaned.
Many continue to do this.
And most likely it got into the ocean current," the coordinator of the Union of Oil Workers in the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste into the open sea.
On the beaches of four out of eight affected states in the north-east of the country, ecologists found nine marine turtles completely coated in an oil film.
And only two of them could be saved.
In the next few days the Brazilian Institute of the Environment together with the company Petrobras will start cleaning the polluted beaches.
Meanwhile, institute specialists advise tourists and local residents to avoid oil slicks and notify of any oil spills discovered.
Medvedev orders a review of food service industry standards
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev tasked the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Industry and Trade together with the business ombudsperson and the business community to review the sanitary and epidemiological rules and norms for food service organizations.
They are also expected to study the issue of transitioning to using food service requirements outlined in the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.
The agencies are expected to present their recommendations to the government no later than October 15 according to a list of Medvedev's orders from the Dialog program that aired on September 11 on Rossiya 24 television.
Medvedev also tasked the aforementioned agencies, except for the Ministry of Justice, to present their recommendations on conducting an experiment from January 1, 2020, to limit inspections of food service organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and the Kaliningrad region.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economic Development were instructed to introduce a bill by November 11 to the government, amending the Administrative Code on the use of administrative measures to suspend business activities for violations of food service requirements leading to consumer harm.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing and the Ministry of Finance are required to address the issue of the gradual transition, from 2021, to the use of a consumer goods basket founded on a basic selection of produce comprising a complete healthy diet.
The business community spoke out on the outdated norms after one of the AnderSon chain's cafes was closed.
The business community demanded that the current sanitary regulations be cancelled and the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing announced the joint development of new ones.
The list included 33 agencies.
The Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing intends to cut the number of sanitary norms and regulations to one-fortieth of their current level by 2021.
Investigators currently have information on three thefts involving detainee
A man was operating in the Skuratovskiy district of Tula.
He was stealing batteries and radios from cars.
The thief took accumulator batteries from two cars — VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2017—presumably to be sold later.
“The perpetrator also took a radio and subwoofer from another BAZ-2017 car, with the same purpose”, reported the Tula Oblast office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The perpetrator probably intended to resell the stolen items.
An unemployed 26-year-old man is currently detained.
Russians have nothing to put away for retirement – V. Matviyenko
Federation Council speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have enough savings for the draft legislation on a guaranteed pension product to fully come into force.
Boosting pensions with personal savings is quite a widespread practice around the world.
Whether the timing is right to implement it here is another matter.
"In my view, at present a significant part of the population's income leaves nothing to set aside for increasing their pension in the future," said V. Matviyenko.
Russians, in the speaker's opinion, cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and accrual, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them".
This statement does not mean that I am against perfecting the pension system, correcting its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to improve citizens' pension amount and social security.
But steps in this direction must be well thought out, responsible, taking domestic conditions into account," V. Matviyenko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council emphasized that if this initiative (draft legislation on a guaranteed pension product) is to be developed, several fundamental principles must be considered, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and firm guarantees and state responsibility for ensuring the security of pension savings.
The Russian Finance Ministry on 6 September announced that draft legislation on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) had been sent for approval.
Its main elements include exclusively voluntary participation of citizens in the savings system, state-guaranteed security of citizens' long-term pension savings, registration of citizens' savings accounts by a central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

News about their favorite superhero leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe angered many devoted fans
One of the most famous comic heroes – Spider-Man – is remaining in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The companies Disney and Sony Pictures reached an agreement on rights to use him in films of the franchise.
This was announced in a Sony press release that says part three of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on screens on 16 July 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, due to which "Spider-Man" was leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony holds rights to the superhero.
It leased them out for Disney's Marvel films.
As a result Sony received revenues from box office takings, and Disney – from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point this situation stopped suiting Disney, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced that he is thrilled.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it.
“Spider-Man is a powerful icon.
A hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe," says his press release.
At the same time Feige recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built around Spider-Man.
"He happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes.
So as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold,” he noted.
Commenting on the news, Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, conspicuously placed on his Instagram account a fragment from the film "Wolf of Wall Street" in which hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I’m not leaving!"
Information about disagreements between the companies appeared in August.
According to mass media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box-office takings from films about Spider-Man on condition that both companies pay half the film production costs.
But this did not suit Sony.
News about their favorite superhero's possible departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe provoked anger among many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
As CNBC reports, Sony has refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have had a great collaboration over the last four years, and our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans [of Spider-Man].
We are delighted to be moving forward together.”
The film "Avengers: Endgame", bringing together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of world cinematography, knocking "Avatar" out of first place.

Search team comes to renowned blogger Andriy Poltava: what's known at present
On Friday, 27 September, in Poltava in the home of relatives of the volunteer and blogger Andriy Karpov, known as Andriy Poltava, a search is under way.
The blogger himself reported this on Facebook, noting that he does not live at that address.

A second analogous device, placed in an automobile will be activated today near the home of renowned Ukrainian propagandist Karpov Andriy Anatolyevich (he is famous as Andriy Poltava) ...
Death to punishers."

Poltava's followers are certain that he does vital broadcasts and wish him strength and perseverance.
To recap, Poltava conducts talks with Russians about the war in Donbas, the annexation of Crimea, about peace, politics, and then posts videos on the internet.
The blogger ran for the Verkhovna Rada representing the party European Solidarity.
He now hosts TV broadcasts on the Pryamiy channel, where he harshly criticizes Russian propaganda.
In 2017, according to the TV channel ICTV, Karpov was recognized as Ukraine's best blogger.
Riigikogu: Estonia wants to make 2050 climate goals even more ambitious
Committee chairman Anneli Ott noted that to date there have been three hearings in the committee.
Experts, entrepreneurs and representatives from the Ministry of the Environment presented their vision for achieving carbon neutrality in Estonia.

The chairman added that the government had scheduled a discussion on increasing Estonia’s climate ambitions for 3 October.
The decisions made as a result will be further discussed in the committees of the Riigikogu.

It is necessary to take the socioeconomic impact of all the changes into account,” Sikkut emphasized.
This autumn the Riigikogu committee on European Union affairs started a series of parliamentary hearings for preparation of a resolution with which Estonia will participate in the EU negotiations on 2050 climate targets.

To recap, Vladmir Pozner, Mireille Mathieu (France), Alessandro Safina (Italy), Valeriya, Soso Pavliashvili, Igor Krutoi, Zara, Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Denis Klyaver, Valery Syutkin, Dmitry Malikov, Maxim Pokrovsky, Yana Poplavskaya, Maxim Averin, Ksenia Alferova, Nonna Grishayeva and others participated in the video.
Most of the flashmob's participants publicly support the Kremlin's aggressive policy.
Vinnik was the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
Earlier the singer's press service explained that the artist took part in the project in support of the International Day of Peace, which is marked on 21 September, and had not changed his patriotic position.
To recap, a wave of outrage appeared on the internet.
The clip itself was called a mockery.
How can artists, who have visited occupied Crimea and who support Putin's policy that unleashed war in Donbas, where people are killed almost every day, speak of peace?

The first MMA fights under rules that Alexander Emelianenko thought up will take place in Moscow on 29 November – in the undercard of a fight between Emelianenko and strongman Mikhail Koklyaev.
Our fights have lost their entertainment value," Emelianenko said in an interview with Sport Express.
There's nothing to look at
That's why I came up with a new type of mixed martial arts – Universal World Fight.
The rule is three different rounds.
MMA is a type of sport where all martial arts come together.
A mixed-style fighter must know how to do everything – standing work, wrestling, ground fighting.
The first round is standing strike technique.
The second round is just wrestling with a 30-second hold-down time limit.
The third round – everything is permitted.
When will the first tournament take place under the rules that you made up?
On 29 November.
In the undercard of our fight with Koklyaev.
But it's not yet known how many fights there will be.

Trade with Russia – it is not just tanks
Trade turnover between Russia and India has doubled thanks to the geopolitical situation.
The trade figures were announced by Manish Kumar, Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, at the fifth-anniversary forum of small- and medium-sized businesses of SCO and BRICS nations.
It is important for us to learn from SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, Kumar said.
- Our confederation numbers 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of these are small- and medium-sized businesses, which work with Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries.
We are not standing still, we are developing, what's more, all the sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation only help us all grow.
Currently, our bilateral trade exceeds $10 billion, but this figure could be doubled.
Mainly on account of new health care technology, artificial intelligence and robot technology.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy machinery.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established its first contacts with Russia's modern centers
The delegation from Deli and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We signed a memorandum on creating a system with which it will be possible to build modern business.
After all, enterprise is not just a whim but a necessity.
A necessary step for us on the road to economic well-being.
We need to expand and attract small- and medium-sized businesses and together with Russia, China and other counties we will definitely do this," said the Indian industrialist.
Ufa is holding the forum of small- and medium-sized businesses of SCO and BRICS nations for the fifth time consecutively.
From September 25-27, more than 2,800 people from Russia and 31 other countries took part in the forum.
During a working trip to Tobolsk, the governor of the Tyumen Oblast, Alexander Moor, took part in the ceremonial opening of the Sokolova water facility after reconstruction.
Now it has a production capacity of 25 thousand cubic meters a day.
The reconstruction of the water facility was carried out as part of the federal “Clean Water” project under the national “Ecology” project.
The authorities were helped by investors: the Sokolova water facility was another example of applying the mechanism of private-state partnership.
The Tyumen Oblast has an experience of cooperation in this field between federal structures, regional authorities, local administrations, and private investors that is unique in the country.
New artesian wells have appeared at the site.
Pump houses were built over them.
The water purification and decontamination facilities were reconstructed.
As a result, the Sokolova water facility will provide the Tobolsk people with quality drinking water.
There are plans to connect the Sokolova and Zhukov water facilities.
Then Tobolsk will be fully able to switch over to underground water sources.
Water treatment facilities are being expanded in Vagay
Congress detected "Russian meddling" in Trump's conversation with Zelensky
The lower house of the US Congress accused Russia of complicity in the scandal caused by the phone conversation of White House head Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.
The supposition that "Russians" are somehow behind what happened was expressed by House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, MSNBC News reports.
"I think Russia has a hand in this," said the Democrat, without providing further comment.
The Pelosi-led Democrats, who have a majority in the chamber, earlier announced the launch of impeachment proceedings against the president.
This happened after an intelligence informer complained about Trump.
The informer suspected that during a conversation with Zelensky in July Trump pressured his interlocutor, so that Ukraine would open a case against the son of former vice-president Joseph Biden, while the latter could become Trump's rival in elections in a year's time.
The White House had to provide members of Congress and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

Expert explained why you should give up tea in bags
A group of scholars from Canada representing McGill University have discovered that more than ten billion particles of microplastic fall into a cup in five minutes when brewing a tea bag.
Sawdust particles can also be added to packaged drinks, said Nation News food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can’t get reliable information on the contents of packaged tea—the manufacturer can add ingredients that won’t be identified on the package.
Sawdust isn’t thrown away at the end of the season, so it could end up in the tea.
“Moreover, the packets don’t always include tea plants”, Tikhonova said.
According to her, it’s better to give up consuming such drinks in favor of loose-leaf tea, which is sold in specialty stores.
She also emphasized that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the contents, but also in the way it’s produced—microparticles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to start emitting harmful substances.
“The best thing is to buy pure green or black tea—this kind of drink will have less additives”, the expert noted.

Regions requested to share secrets of business support
As Parliamentskaya Gazeta learned, on September 27, Andrei Kutepov, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee for Economic Policy, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a request to express a position on the initiatives of the territorial subjects of the federation for improving legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized businesses (SMB).
It's time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee for Economic Policy compiled the regions’ information on their active programs for business development and the legal status of the self-employed, and also on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SMB development and sent suggestions for improving the existing legislation.
“To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, and therefore question of the absence of information on regional programs of business development in the country as a whole was raised by the business community in all the regions that the senators visited,” Andrei Kutepov stated.
The addendum to the letter sent to the Government presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problematics (available to the editors).
In addition to the ministries’ profiles, the summary data from the regions was also sent to the directors of the regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be to distribute information held by the Committee for Economic Policy”, the senator told Parliamentskaya Gazeta.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operated programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, there is a business support center functioning in the Vologda Oblast, which, besides financial support measures, supports businessmen in carrying out the certification of finished products.
A business support system has been developed in the Ivanovo Oblast that envisages the implementation of the principle of the one-stop shop through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar region, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.
There is a cluster development center functioning in the Oryol Oblast.
Within the framework of the federal “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Businesses” project, the Amur Oblast provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of active non-state coworking centers, with funds from the federal budget.
And special support measures for youth entrepreneurship are being taken in a number of other regions.
The self-employed continue to come out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to existing legislation to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelsk Oblast proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurial activity”, as this “best corresponds to the content of the state service for promoting the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
The Ivanovo Oblast believes it’s necessary to introduce amendments providing for the expansion of the list of the types of businesses provided by self-employed citizens, including work on finishing and repairing residential spaces and suburban buildings, and conducting physical training classes.
The Bryansk Oblast considers it important to strengthen control over unprincipled producers of dairy products with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostroma and Magadan Oblasts, they advocate for consolidating the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and the directions of social entrepreneurship support within the legal framework.
All of the proposals from the regions will be taken into consideration when preparing state programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All of the proposals from the regions will be taken into consideration when preparing state programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills,” assured Andrei Kutepov.
Airline helps passengers avoid sitting near crying babies
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new function: you can now find out where young children will be sitting when booking seats on a plane.
You can now avoid sitting near them if you want.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers got the chance to use the new option and avoid unwelcome proximity to young children.
The airline has launched a function that allows you to track where children will be sitting.
Choosing seats in the cabin while booking tickets, passengers will be able to see the image of a child’s head on the seats that will be occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who don’t want to fly near toddlers because of the possible disturbances caused by their crying can sit as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline’s services were delighted with the development.
Some of them thanked the airline, noting that other airlines should take the same steps.
One of the users complained that he flew from New York to Doha three weeks ago and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commenter suggested introducing “adults-only flights”, expressing the willingness to pay extra for such a trip.
Many tourists noted that now they will always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, because they see nothing pleasant about flying near children in an enclosed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with a breast-feeding infant tried to placate her fellow travelers on a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared a bag of candy with a note of apology for each of the 200 passengers.
Has an Oleg Tabakov train appeared in the Moscow metro?

Rare archival photos and film scenes can be seen on the carriages' walls.
Russian gays with adopted children seeking asylum in the USA
A same-sex pair of Russians with two adopted children requested asylum in the USA, RIA Novosti reports.
It is reported that the men left Russia for Ukraine, then went to the States, where they submitted an application for asylum.
According to a statement by the group Stimul, the reason for such actions by the family was "unceasing interest on the part of law-enforcement bodies".
It is reported that the men do not plan to return to Russia.
The children have been attending an American school since the beginning of the school year and are adapting to the new conditions.
To recap, earlier it was reported that a case had been opened against employees of the social welfare department in the Marino district over the adoption of two small boys by a same-sex family.
However, the HRC said that child-raising by a same-sex pair in itself should not be a reason to initiate proceedings.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of "Moscow case" defendants
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined the "Freedom for all" series of one-person pickets taking place on Friday at the presidential administration building on Staraya ploshchad in Moscow, an Interfax correspondent reports.
The series of pickets started on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself and have continued every day since then.
Currently participants in the rally, taking turns, stand holding a poster in their hands with the text "Freedom for all" and the surnames of those convicted and arrested after the unauthorized protests in Moscow in summer 2019.
Besides that of Ustinov, the poster bears the names of Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglets, Yevgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopayev, Aidar Gubaydulin, Alexei Minyaylo, Sergei Fomin, Samarddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa.
Moscow's Tverskoy court on 16 September sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a general-regime penal colony on charges of using violence against a Russian National Guard OMON officer at an unauthorized rally on 3 August in the center of Moscow (p. 2. art. 318 of the Russian Criminal Code).
After this on 20 September on an appeal to the Prosecutor General the court changed Ustinov's punishment from detention in custody to recognizance not to leave.
Within 24 hours a petition for Ustinov's release collected more than 112 thousand signatures.
Theater and cinema artists began a flashmob in support of their colleague.
A line to participate in the one-person picket as a sign of solidarity with the actor formed on 18 September on Staraya ploshchad.
Rights advocates, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors and Orthodox clergy demanded a retrial.
Ustinov's sister Yulia told Interfax that her brother does not plan to speak at a rally in the capital on 29 September in support of "Moscow case" defendants.
"Sanctions" shipments to Russia fell to 1% of previous level
The Russian government calculated that shipments of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food import ban had fallen since 2013 to less than 1% of their previous level.
According to a report sent to Russian president Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products were shipped from sanctioned countries in the first half of 2019, compared with 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period of 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time the value of the imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
This refers to shipments of products that did not fall under the embargo.
As the paper indicates, reduced volumes of products prohibited for import were compensated on account of an import increase from countries of the CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
To recap, at the end of August the government extended until 31 December 2020 the validity period of rules on the destruction of agricultural products, primary produce and foodstuffs prohibited for import to Russia within the framework of counter sanctions.
The document, published on the official portal of legislative information, notes that the validity period of the rules was extended for one more year – from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially the decree on the destruction of sanctioned goods was applied to products from the USA, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Lichtenstein "joined" the list, and from 1 January 2016 – Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin about the destruction of "sanctioned" products (products falling under the import ban, which Moscow introduced in response to the West's anti-Russian sanctions) illegally imported into the country came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government permitted "sanctioned" foodstuffs to be destroyed by any legal means.
To the extent that the West's sanctions are maintained, Russia also extended its counter measures.
At the same time the said measure does not apply to foodstuffs that citizens import for personal consumption.
The ban does not apply to the import of products for personal use of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Russian Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov earlier described the destruction of foodstuffs as "simply immoral", and this, in his words, has a negative effect on people's development.
In addition, at the beginning of June the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare proposed banning the destruction of foodstuffs.
After that the presidential council for human rights gave a similar recommendation to the government.
And Russian deputy prime minister Alexei Gordeyev said that destroying foodstuffs is wrong, and that it is necessary to think how to use them for their intended purpose, having evaluated their quality.

Chile starts building 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
As ESO reports, construction began this week on the dome of the building, where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project thus far, will be placed.
According to ESO estimates, the total cost will exceed a billion euros.
The bulk of this money will be spent on preparing equipment and building the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-large window, which will have a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 1.4-meter hexagonal segments.
This huge mirror and two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with diameters of 4.2 and 3.75 meters will help the E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system and stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth analogs.
Additionally, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome has just begun, the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory were already developed by scientists, engineers, and other specialists three years ago—from the time the first plans for building the E-ELT were announced.
The German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc received the contract for producing the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros.
