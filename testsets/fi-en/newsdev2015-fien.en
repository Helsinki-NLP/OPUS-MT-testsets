Changes in business support policies - Region - Areas - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU support for businesses, also the administration of national business support will be concentrated in four Centres for Economic Development, Transport and Environment (ELY Centres), starting from mid-September.
The ELY Centre of Southern Savo in Mikkeli is responsible for the activity in eastern Finland.
According to the new business support law, which came into effect in the beginning of July, the EU’s Structural Funds support may not be applied to large companies any more, except in case of completely new activities.
The subsidiaries of the municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants will also be considered as large municipalities.
However, the EU support can be granted also in the future for investments that improve municipalities’ economy prerequisites.
The unit which will be administrating both EU and national support in eastern Finland will consist of approximately 30 persons.
At least for the time being, all of them will continue working at their current sites.
For example, the workplace of Mr Kalevi Pölönen, the head of the Structural Fund unit of the Southern Savo ELY Centre, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: this is what Russia aims at in Ukraine
Russia acts in a consistent manner, even though it always wouldn’t seem so.
Lecturer Torsti Siren, Lieutenant Colonel and the director of the Department of Strategic and Defence Studies of the National Defence University, wasn’t surprised by the ambivalent Ukraine news on Monday morning.
It has been the same stuff for a long time, Siren says.
On one side, we had Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov calling for an immediate ceasefire and declaring that Russia will not attack Ukraine. (Read more here.)
On the other side, we had Ukraine reporting that their paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank unit near Luhansk airport, and that the tank unit has received reinforcements. (Read more here.)
Lavrov demands an unconditional ceasefire to be achieved at the talks in Minsk.
Russia denies being involved, and requires that an immediate negotiation outcome must be reached, so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and in Donetsk.
That’s the whole point, Siren says.
This is the big picture: you must start negotiating quickly, and especially so, that Russia will get a hold of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair outsources cabin services to a Norwegian company, employees laid off
Finnair will start buying cabin services from a Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation as subcontracted work.
In the first phase, the agreement concerns Finnair’s Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but the plan is to extend it later.
The outsourcing of the two routes will result in a reduction of approximately hundred employees in Finland, and it will be carried out through lay-offs in the first stage, the company told in its statement.
Moreover, the employment of approximately 80 Asian temporary workers will end when the routes will be outsourced.
Finnair told already in June that it is going to outsource the cabin services of approximately 20 routes during the next two years.
The company decided to opt for the outsourcing, after an agreement regarding the savings couldn’t be reached with the personnel.
The plan is to start the outsourcing during the first three months of next year.
According to the company the co-operation negotiations shall continue also with other partner candidates.
A study shows that the sleep disorders will multiply the risk of the nerve-originated back pain, i.e. sciatica pain, among the persons performing heavy duty shift work.
A study carried out by Finnish Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection between the sleep disorders and the sciatica pain is surprisingly strong, even though several other factors were taken into account.
Firefighters’ good muscular strength and physical endurance, which are tested regularly, don’t seem to protect from pain, says lecturer Sirpa Lusa, the director of the research, in the statement from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.
The firefighters’ work is irregular shift work, and the shifts may be up to 24 hours long.
According to the Finnish Institute Occupational Health, the sleep disorders are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey, which was carried out in 1996, 1999, and 2009.
Are you aware of the new surprising reasons for water damages?
Easily cause damage in other apartments
Water damages A specialist from the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation reminds that the origin of a water damage is by no means always a leaking tube or a dripping tap.
We have been contacted when the breaking up of a fish tank has caused a water damage in the condominium, and we have been asked if it is possible to ban the fish tanks, says Marina Furuhjelm, the law specialist of the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation.
Ms Furuhjelm reminds that the tubes and drains alone aren’t the common causes for water damages, but nowadays also the new appliances, such as ice cube machines, have increasingly been causing water damages in the apartments.
Many aren’t aware that the appliances, such as dishwasher or laundry machine, must not be left turned on unattended.
Also the water tap must always be shut when the appliance is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the tubes may lead to a leak.
A dweller can be deemed negligent, if these obligations have been omitted, and in such cases the dweller is liable to pay the damages.
Of course, in such cases the home insurance may pay a compensation, depending on the insurance terms and on the case.
The dweller is liable to pay the damages, if it can be shown that the dweller’s negligent actions have caused the damages.
If the dweller has passed out in the shower covering the shower drain, the negligence can often be proved, because usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere, and the janitor enters the apartment in which the passed out dweller can be found.
Ms Furuhjelm tells that since the passing out on the shower drains has become so common, nowadays many student dormitories have two floor drains installed in the shower facilities.
Also waterbeds have caused water damages, albeit not as often as before, when they were more popular.
Even the tipping over of a dog’s water bowl or of a homemade wine container can result in serious water damages.
I also know about a case in which the many cats living in the apartment had been peeing on the floors so, that it caused great damages, says Ms Furuhjelm.
The principle of the liability to pay for the damages is always the same, unless the condominium statutes state otherwise.
The member is responsible for repairing the surface material and the damages in the condominium structure, as well as the damages caused to other apartments.
The water damages easily ruin other apartments, because the structure’s concrete absorbs water very easily.
Ms Furuhjelm says the heater leaks are especially troublesome, as the heaters easily leak into the structure insidiously.
The water damages can be caused by the air source heat pumps, which have become common nowadays, and which produce condensate water.
The water should be conducted to a fixed drain or rain water network, and not just into a container.
The member also has the responsibility of removing water, ice, and rubbish from the balcony, the law specialist advises.
Ms Furuhjelm instructs that even if the condominium rules don’t require for example a fixed outlet tube for the washing machine, the insurance terms may have a clause based on which the compensation will not be paid.
The home insurance terms and conditions should be read carefully.
However, I consider the loose washing machine water outlet tubes, that have been positioned for example in the bathtubs, a great risk, and they have caused several damages.
I recommend that the waste water would always be conducted in a fixed way into a sewage pipeline.
Removing snow and water from the balcony
Monitoring the washing machine, dishwasher, etc. when they are on.
Closing the water taps (of the washing machine and the dishwasher)
Cleaning of the visible parts of the floor drain twice in six months.
The recommendation is to connect the waste water in a fixed manner into the drain.
Checking the taps for possible leaks
Regular unfreezing of the freezer

FC Honka lost again and sank to the bottom of the series
The two currently weakest teams, according to Veikkausliiga league’s performance barometer, met on Sunday evening in Tapiola Sports Park.
FC Honka hasn’t won since June, and was now hosting Vaasan Palloseura, which has been proceeding steadily on a zero win path for seven matches in a row.
The last time VPS won, was exactly in a match against Honka in July.
The Sunday’s confrontation with the Espoo team surely happened at the right moment, as VPS returned finally to the win standard with the result 2-1.
Vaasa’s head coach Olli Huttunen lamented about the inefficiency of his team before the match, but Honka’s disorganized defence department eased VPS’s problems with scoring.
In terms of playing, it was a very nervous performance.
We didn’t manage to get any longer attacks at all, we couldn’t keep the ball,” Mr. Huttunen assessed the performance of his team.
In the first half, the centre-back pair Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played in a really uncertain manner.
Both goals scored by Vaasa’s team were result of the centre-backs’ slack playing.
The opening goal of the match was seen after five minutes only, when Steve Morrissey directed a shot from Sebastian Sandvall past Honka’s dumbfounded goalkeeper Walter Viitala.
The first half irritates me.
When the team went on the field, they did exactly the opposite as to what we had agreed before the game,” Honka’s head coach Shefki Kuqi darned.
After the initial shock, Espoo’s players got their playing together, and were then juggling the ball at the offensive end.
Especially the midfielder Carlos Portela and the winger Roni Porokara were eagerly searching for scoring opportunities, but the last solutions were nearly repeatedly miserable.
The player who got closest to scoring was the midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres eventually gravitated slightly past the VPS’s goal post.
VPS stroke back efficiently, taking advantage of their quick forwards and Honka’s bungling centre-back pair.
At thirty minutes, Vaasa’s team scored 2-0, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart made a breakaway together.
Morrissey served and Steward finished.
In the opening period Morrissey was in a good playing mood, and he continuously created occasions from his left wing,
whereas Stewart’s speed seemed to be too much for Espoo’s defenders through entire match.
”I yelled them at the half-time, that if we’re going to lose, let’s lose with dignity,” Kuqi said.
Vexed Honka sought furiously a goal in the second half in order to narrow the result.
The team was close to scoring twice, until the third attempt succeeded.
The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal from the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa’s goal Honka had a half an hour to reach a draw.
Espoo’s team took greater and greater risks, which gave VPS opportunities to dangerous counter-attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got once in a face-to-face situation with Viitala, but the sharp stopping of Honka’s goalkeeper kept the home team in the game.
Towards the end Honka slightly ran out of steam, and didn’t manage to score any more.
Along with the defeat, Honka sank to the bottom of Veikkausliiga league, as there still are seven matches to go before the season ends.
Newspaper: Putin blustering about being able to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was rather harsh during his telephone conversation with the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reports.
Mr. Putin expressed his irritation regarding European Union’s plans to tighten the sanctions against Russia.
Mr. Putin said that if he wants to, he can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica reports.
According to La Repubblica, Mr. Putin’s message to Mr. Barroso was the following: It is not advisable to provoke Russia with new sanctions.
Mr. Putin gave an interview regarding the Ukraine crisis to the Russian Television’s Channel One on Sunday evening.
Mr. Putin told in the interview that he considers the conflict to be only Ukraine’s internal conflict, and encouraged Kiev government to negotiate directly with the insurgents.
At the same time he harshly warned Kiev about firing civil targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia cannot just be an ”onlooker” if people are being shot dead at close range, Mr. Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: working as an actor destroyed the family
Heavy-duty work Veteran actor and descendant of a theatre family confesses how working as an actor destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine turns to 70 next Friday, but it’s probably safe to say that when it comes to him, the age is only a number.
I can’t tell any difference when I think about time one year back, or two years or ten years back.
The mental puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Mr. Roine retired years ago, but he still works hard, as if he was many men put together.
There used to be a joke that there aren’t many plays made in this country without Esko Roine.
Currently Mr. Roine has roles in Helsinki City Theatre play ”Miten menestyä vaivatta liike-elämässä”, in Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Mielensäpahoittaja” and Tampere Comedy Theatre play ”Kvartetti”.
Mr. Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Räppääjä film.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
Mr. Roine’s acting career didn’t have a promising start.
I wasn’t accepted for the Nativity play in the school.
40-50 years later the teacher told me it was because I was so lousy.
Esko Roine didn’t give up.
The career choice was clear, there weren’t any alternatives.
It felt familiar and dear.
I was in such hurry to get in the industry that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army, so that I could apply for the theatre school as soon as possible.
Roine has had over 200 roles in theatre and he has done over 300 TV shows, depending a bit on how one calculates it.
If you count the jobs as the Englishmen do, that is counting each TV series episode as a show on its own, the total of the TV jobs amounts to 600.
I spent three years in ”Uusi päivä”, which had three episodes per week.
Two springs ago I was killed in it, because I hadn’t the time to do it.
Commitments until autumn 2016
Esko’s elder sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full force, and they’re doing wild roles as anarchist grannies in Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Vielä ehtii”.
The younger brother will probably be still hanging out on stages for years to come.
That’s what it looks like now, but you never know when you’re talking about a chap of this age.
The condition “I’m in if I’ll be alive” applies.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has bookings for the autumn 2016.
The years have also left their marks on the man.
The age has some collateral effects.
The knees have been operated, the hip whistles and osteoarthritis bothers, but as long as you don’t let it bother too much, you can get along, Esko Roine says.
TV audience remembers Mr. Roine for example from
Merirosvoradio and from a quiz in which he, together with Antti Einiö, gave away ”benknotes”, banknotes worth one hundred marks.
It was Antti Einiö who gave away ”benknotes”.
I tried to insist that they are banknotes and not benknotes.
In the TV series ”Reinikainen” Mr. Roine was the self-important inspector Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the policemen in Tampere, as it turned out that the police department had an inspector similar to him.
A policeman once stopped me on the street, lowered the side window and shouted to me: ”That Rautakallio is fantastic!”
Right workgroup
From theatre works Mr. Roine remembers especially works such as
Helsinki City Theatre plays ”Producer” and ”Mestariluokka”, Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Kauppamatkustajan kuolema” and Tampere Theatre play ”Pitkän päivän matka yöhön”.
A common element among those works is that they all have been popular.
I can’t take the credit for it, it’s the workgroup that has succeeded.
There have been some low points too.
The role of Pekka Puupää in a feature film is one of those.
There are also others.
The reason is that I’ve agreed to do them too easily.
I don’t know if I regret those roles or not, but the result doesn’t satisfy neither me nor the audience.
As a rank-and-file actor you don’t get to choose your works.
You just are a nice boy and do what you’re told.
On the side of theatre works Mr. Roine has also sought success in business.
In the 80s he ran a restaurant called ”Wanhat Roomeot” in Tampere.
It was an instructive experience.
It didn’t work out at all when I simultaneously tried to be the executive director of Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then also a restaurateur.
If I remember correctly, it became clear in one year that these tasks aren’t compatible in any way.
The typical situation was when the performance was about to end, or the interval had started, and I already had been thinking of turning the sauna on, when I received a call from the restaurant, and I was told that my friends had popped in and were hoping to see me after the performance.
Memoirs on the occasion of the birthday
Esko Roine’s memoirs will be released on his birthday. Ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen have written the book.
Well, they’ve managed to cobble up some kind of product out of the memories of a facemaker.
Namely, when I used to play in Zoom I was called The Facemaker.
They didn’t know me by name at all.
The book has been in the making for years.
Mr. Roine already told long time ago that there will be no scoops, because he hasn’t done anything so wild, or if he has, he won’t tell it.
I wrote a little opening statement for the book.
I’m saying in it that if someone is waiting for revelations packed with scandals or good gossip, it is better to stop reading there and then.
It contains pretty much stuff related to my profession, both as an actor and as a theatre director.
The publisher boasts that there are some stories about hilarious times at the theatre school in the book.
It was quite normal student life, but I must admit that when I was a kid I did all kinds of stuff.
It wasn’t as wild when Turkka was the director.
It was very different.
I don’t know how much I got out of it, except for the self-confidence that when I’ve finished the school, I know that I can’t blame that, if my actions won’t get any better.
You didn’t have to think, oh how good I would be if I only had gone to school.
Mr. Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Manni, and Hannes Häyrinen, and got to work with them.
There were several legends, starting from my first father-in-law Kaarlo Halttunen.
We were very close with Pia Hattara.
Tauno Palo is not with us any more, but I managed to get to know him when I was in school.
Palo’s second son Martti was on the same course with me.
At the theatre school Mr. Roine met his first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
The divorce is a painful thing for him to remember.
After a relatively long battle the children were split.
Not in halves, but the daughter went to the mother, and I got the son.
I didn’t think it was a good solution, and as far as I can see the children more or less agree now that they’re adults.
It is not rare in the theatre circles that the bonds of matrimony end up being dissolved.
In my case it had something to do with the fact that I was working quite a lot also back then.
I was in nearly every production.
Then there were the TV and radio works on top of that.
I was working long hours and the family life suffered because of it.
Possibly an evening off on the big day
Esko Roine will celebrate at Tampere Workers’ Theatre with the play ”Mielensäpahoittaja” on September 7th.
The celebrations will continue in Helsinki City Theatre on September 21st and 28th.
”Mielensäpahoittaja” (”I don’t like to complain, but”) is whining there also.
I was working when I turned fifty and also when I turned sixty.
As such an easily movable play landed in my hands, I thought well, let’s celebrate also the 70th birthday, so that we’ll be done with all that in a blast.
Mr. Roine says there will be no celebrations on the actual birthday.
I seem to remember that it will be an evening off, but I can’t be sure.
I might have booked myself a gig for that day.
Or then I’ll have a strange evening off, which I’m going to keep as an evening off, Mr. Roine says.
Aerospace groups voice concerns over supply chain
Some of Britain's smaller aerospace companies have expressed concern that capacity issues in the supply chain could derail the big aircraft makers' ambitious plans to step up production of passenger jets.
The thousands of companies that make up the UK's aerospace supply chain are at present benefiting from the launch of an unprecedented number of new aircraft and engine programmes under development in the industry simultaneously.
IN Aerospace & Defence
But while many are celebrating the strong backlog of orders, some have warned that the supply chain is already facing capacity constraints and price pressures.
"There is definitely cost pressure and that's coming now with the challenge of volume that is there," says Craig Gallagher, chief executive officer at MB Aerospace, a key supplier to aero-engine manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce.
David Bailey, chief executive of the North West Aerospace Alliance, which represents about 240 aerospace suppliers across the North West of England, says more capacity is needed.
Have we got the strategies and investment plans in line with these growth plans?
I'm not sure to be honest.
What we need to see is investment in new capital equipment and machines that are required to meet these rates," he says.
Some companies say part of the problem is the coincidence of new programmes coming to market and an increase in build rates.
Andrew Churchill, managing director of JJ Churchill, a gas turbine blade manufacturer, says his company has gone through a "challenging time" after a series of programmes were simultaneously started at the beginning of this year.
We went from a position of being quite substantially under capacity to over capacity in the blink of an eye.
We went through a period of extensive arrears and trying to catch up.
But explaining that it's the compression of programmes that's created a problem doesn't win you any brownie points," Mr Churchill says.
JJ Churchill is dealing with the increase in production by investing in £800,000 worth of new machinery and recruiting an additional 26 staff.
Many in the industry believe there needs to be further investment and consolidation among the smaller operators if the UK is to maintain its position as the second - after the US - largest in the aerospace sector.
Geoff Ford, chairman of Ford Aerospace, a Tyneside-based precision engineer, says the backlog of orders should give suppliers the confidence to expand and increase capacity because the work will be there.
"If we don't do that we'll lose out to other countries," Mr Ford says.
Some bigger operators are trying to address the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, the FTSE 250 company that makes aerostructures and engine parts, this year paid £75m to buy UPECA, a Malaysian-based aerospace component manufacturer.
MB Aerospace has acquired businesses in North America and Poland over the past year.
"You can do greenfield start-ups, but in essence the real constraint is the engineering capability and capacity," Mr Gallagher of MB Aerospace says.
Both small and large suppliers say they are facing price pressures which are being cascaded down from the big aircraft makers and the aero-engine manufacturers.
However, some believe the worries over problems in the supply chain are being overplayed.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN's aerospace division, who is also president of ADS, the UK's aerospace trade body, says the supply chain is handling the increase in production better than in previous periods.
There are some tensions in the supply chain but I wouldn't say they are critical.
"It's more about the introduction of new technologies and complexities rather than volume," Mr Bryson says.
He adds that both Airbus and Boeing have learnt from past mistakes and are being much more careful about ramping up their build rates too quickly.
An attempt to increase production in 1997 by Boeing ran into severe difficulties, with the company plunging to a net loss and its factories and supply chain struggling to cope.
Tony Wood, head of Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, says he has not yet come across any problems in the supply chain, which provide the majority of the 18,000 components required to make a jet engine.
"I'm sure there will be bumps in the road but we're pretty confident that we've done a more thorough job right across our supply chain in selecting the best partners and actually being very close with them as they prepare themselves for ramp up," Mr Wood says.
James McNerney, Boeing's chief executive, says its supply chain has been given time to prepare for the increase in build rates.
We feel very good about supply chain capability.
We have given them visibility which is really important.
Meanwhile, Fabrice Brégier, chief executive officer of Airbus passenger jet business, says the company is doing everything possible to mitigate the risks of its planned increase of the A350 to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Perhaps one of the suppliers will fail so our job is to avoid it, to support them, to look for alternatives, but I don't expect big issues," he says.
Mr Brégier adds that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "the quality of the supply chain is the responsibility of the prime contractor.
So this is my job and this is the job of Airbus.
Hong Kong groups vow 'era of civil disobedience' as Beijing rules out open elections
China rules out full democracy for Hong Kong
Pro-democracy activists take to the streets of Hong Kong after China rejects their demands for free elections.
Underlining the potential for escalating confrontation, Hong Kong pro-democracy groups have vowed to ensure the city enters an "era of civil disobedience" in protest against proposed voting reforms imposed by the Chinese government.
Braving stop-start rain under a gleaming Hong Kong skyline, thousands of demonstrators flocked to a rally organised by pro-democracy group Occupy Central outside the offices of the Legislative Council on Sunday night, where they were urged to stage mass sit-ins to cripple the city's financial district.
It came just hours after Beijing said it would deny voters the right to publicly nominate candidates for the city's 2017 chief executive election, pushing back against months of rallies and street demonstrations that have increasingly polarised the city.
Protesters take part in the rally for the beginning of Occupy Central movement outside Central Government Offices in Hong Kong.
"This is about wanting a fair and proper election," said web-page editor Dion Tse, 24, who attended Sunday's rally with her 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.
The central government doesn't respect the voice of Hong Kong people.
We want them to hear our voice and to see the determination of Hong Kong people.
China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress, approved plans for the voting reform which will see two to three candidates allowed to stand in Hong Kong's first direct election.
But with the majority approval of a 1200-strong nomination committee needed, opposition politicians said those with dissenting political views would effectively have no chance of getting on the ballot.
Protesters take part in a rally during the Ocuppy Central with Love and Peace protest at Tamar Park outside of the Hong Kong Government Building.
Police estimated more than 2600 attended the rally at its peak.
A heavy police presence kept watch as about 100 protesters, led by student group Scholarism, converged on the Grand Hyatt late on Sunday, where Communist Party official Li Fei was scheduled to stay after arriving from Beijing.
Occupy Central co-founder Benny Tai fronted a press conference with members of other organisations including the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism, and the Federation of Students.
Mr Tai did not give an exact date for when the blockade would take place for legal reasons, but urged participants to pay attention to developments in "the next week or two," adding the city would official enter an "era of civil disobedience."
Benny Tai answers questions from the media.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at Sunday's rally, standing in front of a billboard plastered with the two Chinese characters for "disobey."
That person will be occupying Central with you!
The convenor of Scholarism, 17-year-old Joshua Wong, said earlier that preparations for high school student strikes were underway and would dovetail with the thousands of university students also expected to boycott classes.
"In addition to our academic responsibility, we also have our social responsibility," he said.
In Beijing, Li Fei, a deputy secretary-general of the NPC standing committee, told reporters that advocating for "international standards" on universal suffrage was a "waste of time" propagated by some Hong Kong politicians seeking to "confuse and mislead" society.
"A lot of time has been wasted before in the debate of impractical suggestions such as public nomination," Mr Li said, insisting that the electoral method should be made in accordance with the true situation and legal framework of each society.
To become law, the universal suffrage bill will require a super-majority of two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-member legislature to pass, meaning the legislation could be stopped by the 27 opposition members in government.
Mr Li warned that Hong Kong could be dragged into protracted political debate if the reform proposal was vetoed.
"It would be harmful to the business environment and the city's development," he said.
Almost 800,000 people voted in an unofficial referendum organised by Occupy Central in June against China's insistence that candidates be vetted through a committee.
As many as 172,000 people marched to push for democracy on July 1, while a pro-Beijing anti-Occupy Central march on August 17 attracted about 88,000, according to estimates by the University of Hong Kong, though police and organiser estimates varied considerably.
3 Injured in Lightning Strike at New York Beach
A lightning strike at a New York City beach has injured three people.
The fire department says the men were injured at Orchard Beach on Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Sunday evening as bad storms rolled through the area.
The men are being treated at a hospital.
The extent of their injuries is unknown.
The lightning strike happened as heavy thunderstorms swept through the city.
Torrential rain, thunder and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebrations, halted play at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens and forced the early end to a musical festival on an East River island.
Dozens of commercial flights into the city's airports were delayed because of the severe weather.

Mount Stuart Hospital cataract ops halted amid safety fears
A consultant has been suspended and the NHS has stopped referring patients to a private hospital for cataract operations after reported problems.
Two people attended Torbay Hospital A&E department after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
Torbay Hospital, in Devon, said it contacted 19 patients treated on 26 July for an "urgent clinical review."
Mount Stuart apologised and said an inquiry was under way after the consultant's suspension.
Torbay Hospital was made aware of the problem when two patients attended its A&E department with eyesight problems after treatment at Mount Stuart.
It said none of the 19 NHS patients - all seen on the same day - have needed corrective surgery.
Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group have stopped referring patients to Mount Stuart following the concerns.
David Sinclair, interim medical director at South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Torbay Hospital, said: "We identified this problem at an early stage and were able to recall all the patients affected very quickly.
Whenever we refer patients to providers, we carry out quality and safety checks and ensure that they meet current legislative and registration requirements.
Gill Gant, director for patient safety at South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "Patient safety is always the absolute priority, so it is important that these cataract operations are paused until we have absolute assurance that the service is safe."
Ramsay Health Care UK, which runs Mount Stuart, said it offered "its sincere apologies to all patients who suffered complications."
It said: "As soon as we realised that there was a potential problem all patients were recalled by Mount Stuart Hospital and then by Torbay Hospital.
The consultant concerned has had practising privileges with Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date he has completed 4,537 cataracts across the organisation and has a history of delivering excellent clinical outcomes with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added the consultant had been suspended while investigations took place.
What is 4chan?
Notorious anonymous message board first to post leaked celebrity nudes
But just what is 4chan and why was it the hacker's first port of call to post the stolen photographs?
First created in 2003, 4chan is a controversial message board that's reviled as much as it is celebrated.
The site is sub-divided into a number of sections or "boards" where anonymous users can discuss everything from video games and travel to pornography and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users don't create consistent identities and posts aren't recorded.
On the more popular boards comments can disappear within minutes as they're pushed "off the bottom of the page" by newer posts.
These two factors have created 4chan's chaotic, anarchic and surprisingly creative atmosphere.
As an anonymous collective, its users are responsible for some of the best known internet memes online (including rickrolling and lolcats) but its lack of regulation means it's also home to a great deal of questionable and straight-forwardly criminal content.
The site's most popular board is /b/, designated for "random" discussions, and is frequently filled with NSFW or "Not Safe for Work" content.
This can vary from soft-core pornography to gore and shock images, and it was here that an anonymous hacker posted the stolen celebrity pictures over the weekend.
CytRx is pouring money into R&D of cancer-fighting drugs
CytRx Corp. is on a mission to cure cancer - or at least slow it down.
The Los Angeles biopharmaceutical company, which recently has become embroiled in a stock-promotion controversy, specializes in researching and developing drugs to treat cancers.
The most promising medication, aldoxorubicin, is a more advanced version of the widely used chemotherapy drug doxorubicin.
CytRx is conducting clinical trials of aldoxorubicin as a treatment for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and recurrent glioblastoma, or brain cancer.
It's sort of like a guided missile that goes to the tumor and not to the rest of the body.- Steven Kriegsman, chief executive of CytRx, on the cancer-fighting drug aldoxorubicin
Aldoxorubicin contains a so-called linker technology that essentially acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the bloodstream that also accumulates in tumors, enabling the drug to be delivered directly to cancer cells.
The linker releases the drug only in an acidic environment, which occurs in cancer cells but not in healthy tissue.
The technology enables patients to be treated with higher and additional doses of the cancer-fighting drug.
"It's sort of like a guided missile that goes to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," said Steven Kriegsman, chief executive of CytRx.
Like many biotech companies that focus on developing drugs, CytRx isn't profitable.
The company issued stock this year, raising about $86 million for operations and research.
CytRx is in the middle of recruiting 400 patients worldwide for its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of a second-line treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma.
Soft-tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat.
A second-line treatment is used when the first-line treatment against the cancer fails.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman said.
The drug could then gain approval by 2017.
Analysts said CytRx released data in December from an earlier clinical trial that indicated aldoxorubicin was a promising treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, there was a question of 'We haven't seen clinical data, how different is it from the underlying drug?'" said Andrew Fein, an analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co.
The release of the results substantiated in a lot of people's mind that it is different.
But Fein said it is hard to predict the outcome and timeline of the current clinical trial because it significantly differs from the previous one that produced good results.
"A lot of things need to go right," he said.
Fein compared developing drugs to the mining industry.
"You invest a lot of money looking for that one spot on the ground that bears gold, and up until you find that spot you continue to pour money in," he said.
Up until you successfully commercialize the drug, it's a continual R&D spend.
CytRx has been hit with multiple shareholder lawsuits contending that the company unfairly touted its performance.
The lawsuits accused the company of hiring the investor relations firm DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired writers to promote CytRx and another biotech firm through articles on websites such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
The articles didn't disclose that they were commissioned by the companies, the lawsuits alleged.
In response to the news, Seeking Alpha said it had removed articles "that were in violation of our policies."
Several stories about the company also disappeared from other websites.
Kriegsman declined to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired outside counsel to defend against the lawsuits.
"It's not something I have time or energy to focus on," he said.
Kriegsman said a real challenge facing CytRx is hiring talented employees, who tend to flock to the biotech centers of San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"It's sort of a wasteland in many ways here" for the pharmaceutical industry, he said.
Analyst views
Shares of CytRx hit $8.08 on Jan. 10, then plunged to below $3 in April after the stock promotion allegations surfaced.
Analyst said the lawsuits and negative publicity have pushed the stock price down further than the fundamentals of the company would warrant.
"It's unfortunate," Fein said, "but I am not sure there is an easy way to get around that as long as the perception is there."
The cameraman of the TV series ”Cops” killed during filming
The cameraman of the TV series ”Cops”, which is based on true events and which is aired also in Finland, died on Tuesday evening when he was shot during an armed conflict.
The cameraman was taping a shootout between an Omaha police patrol and a man suspected of an armed robbery of a fast food restaurant, when he was hit by the bullets.
He quickly died from the injuries.
According to the TMZ site, the police reported that in addition to the cameraman, also the armed robbery suspect died in the shootout.
The TV series ”Cops”, which is among the first reality TV programs, has been broadcast in the US since 1989.
In Finland the series has aired on MTV’s channels since the 1990s.
The question regarding an external killer is going to stand out as the crucial element in the Ulvila killing process, which started today in the Court of Appeal.
Anneli Auer is accused of murdering her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Court of Appeal in Vaasa will hear the case now for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court along with the new evidence.
The intention of the Court of Appeal is to give the sentence before the current year ends.
The Court of Appeal of Vaasa acquitted Ms Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an external killer likely enough.
In his opening speech, the District Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala relayed the prosecutor’s view about the murder night, and about those factors which exclude the possibility of an external killer.
We believe that the crucial question is whether an external person has entered the house and killed Jukka Lahti in a way and in the time Anneli Auer has told.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer’s account,” Kulmala says.
According to the prosecutor, the homicide started from a domestic dispute, during which Ms Auer had announced that she will leave home and file for divorce.
At some point they moved to the kitchen, where Mr Lahti held Ms Auer and tried to stop her from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife,” Kulmala described the murder night events on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several factors prove that there was no external person present.
For example, the emergency call recording doesn’t contain any sounds of an external person.
Auer’s eldest child – daughter – told in an interrogation that she saw the killer, when the man exited the fireplace room door.
The acquittal ruled by the Court of Appeal of Vaasa in 2011 was partially based on the daughter’s account.
According to the prosecutor the daughter’s observation can’t be true.
”The daughter didn’t see any external killer in her parents’ bedroom, even if she went to see there twice,” Kulmala said.
Prosecutor’s new witness is connected exactly to the possibility of an external killer.
Jukka S. Lahti’s sister has told about what happened in the hospital after the murder night.
According to the woman, the only thing the daughter told in the hospital was that she only saw Lahti’s body when she went to the killing scene in the fireplace room.
Auer’s defence is going to present the court with investigation lines the weight of which the police hasn’t, according to the defence, investigated sufficiently.
When the Court of Appeal of Vaasa acquitted Ms Auer three years ago, the court deemed the male DNA found on a billet as one reference of an external person.
Later the sample turned out to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation laboratory.
At that time, a mass DNA sample was taken from 700 persons.
At the same time, a significant amount of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded,” defence attorney Juha Manner said.
One of the defence’s new witnesses tells about a possible external killer.
A woman from Ulvila told the police about a man from Pori, who, according to the woman’s account, had confessed the killing.
The police interrogated the man in the summer.
The prosecutor deliberated that the man from Pori didn’t have anything to do with the homicide.
The prosecutor filed a request for examination for the woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman has lied in her account.
The other new witness of the defence is the nurse who was on duty on the murder night at Satakunta Central Hospital.
The District Court of Satakunta gave Auer a life sentence for murder last December.
According to the District Court sentence, the elements against the possibility of an external killer include for example the accounts of Auer’s children, the missing sounds referring to an external killer on the emergency call recording, as well as the time required by the course of the events.
The sentence was given with votes 2-1.
The judge representing the minority in the voting wrote that in a crime case a conflicting evidence must be considered in favour of the dependant.
For that reason, the daughter’s account must be interpreted so, that notwithstanding the discrepancies in the account she had seen an external killer exiting the fireplace room door.
Auer’s two eldest children have been summoned before the court.
The daughter was heard personally for the first time last year at the District Court of Satakunta.
When heard before the court, she couldn’t recall the murder night events any more.
Auer’s second child named the mother as the killer in a video interrogation in 2011.
The son told he had heard what happened on the murder night through a closed door.
He also told that Auer had been planning the murder for six months.
As a plaintiff the son has no obligation to state anything before the Court of Appeal.
The hearing of the Court of Appeal will continue today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the hearing of Anneli Auer will continue also tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving a sentence of over seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
He'S public enemy number one at the moment thanks to his actions in Ukraine.
And with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to attend the G20 summit held in Brisbane in November, whether or not he should be allowed into the country is a matter of hot debate.
Over the weekend, punk-rock activists Pussy Riot called for Australia to ban Putin from attending the global summit, which includes more than 4000 delegates from the world's most powerful nations.
"We think that this person has no place at the G20," Maria Alyokhina told a packed Sydney Opera House at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Now, with Kiev warning it's on the brink of "full-scale war" and Putin referring to parts of Ukraine as "Novorossiya" or "new Russia," should we really be welcoming here?
Tony Abbott said he is "weighing" the decision.
The Lowy Institute's G20 studies centre director Mike Callaghan said although the meeting is held in Australia, it's not really up to us who comes.
"Australia can say who comes into the country but it's an international meeting," he said.
Much like New York hosts meetings for the UN or Washington hosts meetings for the IMF, Mr Callaghan said "it's not up to the hosts to say 'you can't come.'"
Last week, Tony Abbott said he is "weighing" the decision after Russia's "reprehensible" actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Because he would be coming for a critical international gathering, it's not a decision which Australia really has a right to make unilaterally.
"Nevertheless, it is an important question and it's one that I'll be weighing and I suspect a number of other countries will be weighing in the weeks ahead," he said.
People attend an anti-war meeting Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The event takes place over two days and includes a mix of the world's biggest and emerging economies which accounts for about two thirds of the global population, 85 per cent of its GDP and 75 per cent of global trade.
Members range from Canada to China, France, Japan, Russia, the US and European Union with special invites for a selection of non-G20 members such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
Mr Callaghan said Australia was in the unenviable position of having to balance diverse interests under intense public pressure.
He said the best way for the Prime Minister to handle it was to use the opportunity to grill Russia on what they have been up to.
"The Prime Minister should say "We will be using this opportunity to have a very frank discussion and I will be demanding for President Putin to account for his actions."
To put the onus on if he comes, he will have to face scrutiny," he said.
Quite clearly we're seeing a rise in geopolitical tensions.
I think the world would be expecting them to talk about these things.
Pro-Russian rebels prepare arms for the assault on the positions of Ukrainian army in Donetsk airport, eastern Ukraine.
It's still unclear whether Putin will attend the event and Mr Callaghan said we may not now until days before.
This is probably the last thing on his mind.
I don't think he's going to say "I have to change my attitude on Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November.""
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said while he had the "gravest reservations about that man, Mr Putin, coming to Australia," he understands the fact it's an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to be talking to other nations, other members of the G20, about whether it is appropriate for Mr Putin to come to Australia.
It is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
But following the tragic events of MH17, the complete lack of remorse or responsibility, the lack of full co-operation in terms of MH17, and now, scenes of thousands of Russian soldiers flooding across the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians have grave reservations about welcoming Mr Putin to Australia.
German business attacks "complacent" Berlin
Germany has become "overconfident" and "complacent," with the government pursuing policies that put the country's hard-won competitiveness at risk, some of Germany's top business leaders warn.
Their criticisms of chancellor Angela Merkel's government come as Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing, raising concerns about its ability to continue driving growth in the stagnant eurozone.
Their remarks follow the introduction of policies fiercely opposed by corporate Germany such as the introduction of a minimum wage and a reduction in the retirement age to 63 for certain long-serving workers.
"I think the biggest threat right now is really a kind of overconfidence in Germany, and with that comes a little bit of complacency," said Kurt Bock, the chief executive of BASF, the world's biggest chemical maker by sales.
IN EU Economy
He said: "In general the feeling is that we're doing well, we have money to spend, we have relatively low unemployment, so what's the problem?"
I think that is a big risk.
You can see it in German government policies that we are not really growth-orientated or business-friendly, but rather much more orientated towards the distribution of wealth and serving the expectations of certain stakeholders.
Markus Kerber, managing director of the BDI, the German industry association, said: "Germany is now in a very good position.
But in the next 10 years every economy in the developed world must change. ...[In Germany] the reform agenda is not making the progress that it did in previous years.
The DIHK, the national chamber of commerce, has also railed against the recent policy moves.
Germany continues to enjoy low levels of unemployment and an almost-balanced budget; even consumption, once languid, is growing.
However, poor second-quarter GDP figures have underscored the vulnerability of the export-driven German economy to external shocks, such as from Russia and Ukraine.
GDP dropped 0.2 per cent in the three months to June, compared to the previous quarter.
Germany's lacklustre performance threatens to make the European Central Bank's battle against low inflation even harder and could make quantitative easing more likely.
Mr Kerber urged the government to "switch back from public consumption to public investment," for example by focusing future spending increases more on infrastructure and less on pensions.
He argued that the Merkel government was reaping the rewards of the tough policies enacted in the early 2000s by her Social Democrat predecessor, Gerhard Schröder.
Stefan Heidbreder, managing director at the Stiftung Familienunternehmen, a foundation for family-owned businesses, said: "Germany is still in a good position, compared to other countries.
That is thanks to its companies and less to do with the policies of the government . . .
The experience of our neighbour, France, shows that doling out lots of money for social benefits and intervening to limit freedom to conduct business are the wrong course.
A leading German investment banker was more blunt, describing recent government policies as a "disaster."
Germany risks forgetting everything it has worked hard to achieve in order to just please the electorate.
That's my key concern right now," the banker said.
Mr Bock said the new government coalition's energy reforms had failed to tackle the underlying weaknesses in policy which has left industry facing uncompetitive costs.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly in brawl at music festival after security blocked him from greeting fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attends the Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, California, where he reportedly got into an altercation with a pushy security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a violent altercation with security at a country music festival.
Kutcher was approached by a fan backstage at Stagecoach country music festival in California when things got out of control, TMZ reports.
Kutcher was hanging out in the VIP area when a young woman approached to say hi and shake his hand.
When the Two and a Half Men star went to greet her, overzealous security rushed between them, causing a scuffle.
The actor and the guard got into it, and Kutcher's friends had to restrain him, TMZ reports.
Kutcher is dating his former That 70s Show co-star Mila Kunis after splitting from ex-wife Demi Moore.
The scuffle comes after news that Angus T Jones has basically been dropped as a regular cast member from the hit show, after releasing a video calling the show "filth" and urging fans not to watch.

Vacationer killed by Baltic Sea bacteria
Six people were infected with a bacteria from the Caribbean which has made itself at home in the popular German vacation destination.
One of them is now in a coma.
The bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, though most-concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.
It spreads best in brackish waters with temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius.
"This could be found anywhere as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, the first director of State Office of Health and Welfare (LAGuS) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, told The Local.
It is just as prevalent in Denmark, Poland, and all along the German coast.
The victim had been holidaying on the island of Usedom at the end of July, according (LAGuS).
He passed away at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks and there is a possibility he will lose a leg.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small open wound on his leg.
He went to the hospital after noticing on the drive home that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors diagnosed blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
"My husband would not have been in the Baltic Sea under any circumstances had he known about the danger," his wife, Sonja Bruehl, told the Ostsee Zeitung.
His serious illness and the havoc the sepsis has brought to him and his family could have been avoided with better information, such as a notice from the resort.
LAGuS told dpa news agency that doctors were told to look out for infections at the beginning of the summer, though no public notice was given.
Cooler temperatures have made the already low risk of contracting the bacteria even more nominal.
"The results we have from [Monday's] tests showed a stark decrease in the presence of V. vulnificus," Dr. Will said.
The cooler temperatures have done their job.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative to the bacteria that causes cholera, is especially harmful to those with chronic liver disease and compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or diabetes and the elderly.
Men are also at a higher risk as oestrogen has shown to have a protective effect against the pathogen.
If it takes hold, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
Wounds infected by the bacteria have a mortality rate of approximately 25 percent.
The bacteria can also infect people through the ingestion of seafood containing V. vulnificus, though Dr. Will said that is not the case here.
It is mostly in the southern hemisphere where the seafood is also infected.
The last recorded deaths in Germany from V. vulnificus poisoning were in 2010, when the bacteria claimed two victims.
Vieno Kekkonen: mastectomy due to cancer suspects
Revelation Singer Vieno Kekkonen, who will turn 80, is doing gigs and working out often, but she also has had to fear for her health.
It surely is unbelievable that radiant Vieno Kekkonen is already turning 80.
She’s astounded herself, too, about how the years suddenly are so many.
I haven’t really realized that I’m this old.
80 sounds really a lot, Vieno Kekkonen says, letting out a laughter.
The birthday will be spent with family.
At the end of August, a birthday celebration was organized for her by a folk music and pensioner association in Karttula, where she lived as a child.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place where my grandfather was born.
I was completely bemused by the celebration, the birthday lady says, referring to the event where the stage, fit for three hundred, was cramped with people who wanted to congratulate her.
A couple of days later, in Muhos, there was an event to greet Armi Kuusela, the life of whom Vieno Kekkonen remembers having followed when she was young.
And now we’re both this old!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During her long career there only are few sides of Vieno Kekkonen that haven’t been seen in the public.
One thing she has never told publicly: in 2006 she had an unilateral mastectomy.
There was an ambiguous finding on my breast in such spot that it was decided to remove the breast completely.
Eventually it wasn’t cancer, which of course made me happy.
During the same operation a new breast was made, so it was a rather large operation.
Vieno Kekkonen hasn’t thought that losing her breast was in a way unnecessary, because the awareness of an ambiguous finding would have been a heavy burden to bear, and such thing can’t be not taken care of.
I was just so relieved when it wasn’t anything serious, Vieno Kekkonen says, and notes that for younger women losing a breast is surely more difficult.

Farmers being made the party responsible for the sea condition
The level of the discussion about the bad conditions of the Baltic Sea in connection with the Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of the experts has been drowned in politically motivated opinions.
During the summer, especially Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have insisted on agriculture’s responsibility for the nutrient emissions in the Baltic Sea.
In the same breath, quick actions for getting the emissions under control have been demanded.
Compared to few environment researchers, and journalists who have studied the matter with their help, an average farmer seems a supreme nutrient expert.
Farmers know that the nutrient wash can’t originate from farming, if the same amount of nutrients has been sowed into the field as it is being harvested from it.
In Finland, nearly all farms have committed themselves to the environment program.
The program strictly restricts the use of the fertilizers, and it requires accurate tracking and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities monitor that the conditions are being followed.
The nutrients which are accumulated in the field have washed up into the waterways also after the fertilizer restrictions, but also in this matter a clear diminishing in the emissions has been evident for years.
The farmers have the willingness and the capacity to work further in order to reduce the nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that the zero level is impossible to reach.
”If the goal is to have such an amount of agriculture production that it approximately meets the consumption, you just have to accept that it’s like this,” says Jyrki Aakkula, the director of environment research in MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MT, August 29th).
The past summer brought large blue-green algae accumulations to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers agreed quite unanimously that the algae drew its growth force from the sea’s own phosphorus reserves.
The phosphorus accumulated in the bottom of the sea comes partially from the coast countries’ agriculture during the past decades, but can’t explain the accumulation alone.
The cleaning of the waste waters of the growing cities on the Baltic Sea coasts was neglected until the end of 20th century.
The problem concerned also the waste waters of the Greater Helsinki and they weren’t considered a problem except in terms of contamination of city’s own shores.
The contamination of the shores was prevented by building, still as late as in the 1980s, a waste water tube which reached the open sea.
The quality of the water conducted to it has of course improved over the years.
The nutrients that have ended up in the sea in the past won’t disappear, even if the agriculture would be terminated completely in Finland.
And yet, every summer, the blue-green algae discussion, and the raised accusations always target today’s agriculture.
The public debate stigmatises the farmer as the responsible for the Baltic Sea’s condition.
The accusation is excessive, but it becomes even more troublesome when it’s being used as a mean to fulfil political ambitions.
The Greens are driving great changes in the environment norms for the agriculture, lead by the Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö.
Mr. Niinistö has used this summer’s algae debate as a stepping stone.
Mr. Niinistö has accused, using harsh words, the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) for being antiquated, and has considered it the most difficult obstacle for the water protection.
Also the political rhetoric should have a limit.
Most of the special projects related to the water protection are explicitly based on the cooperation between MTK, farmers, and environment administration.
Mr. Niinistö’s offensive style serves more the attempts to lure the votes of the urban green voters, than the water protection.
Well, that’s probably its purpose.
By using hard talk the Greens are preparing themselves for leaving the government.
In case of policy changes, the MTK’s task is to take care of the subsistence of their members.
It is difficult to sell expensive changes to farmers, if you can’t get a reimburse for the expenses.
The only funds Ville Niinistö has talked about, are the cuts from other agriculture funds.
Mining tax repeal won't pass: Palmer
The Abbott government's latest attempt to scrap the mining tax appears doomed with Clive Palmer declaring his senators will vote it down without changes.
Labor also fears the government has included a measure in a new repeal bill that could limit increases to compulsory superannuation contributions by employers out to 2034.
The government amid confusion and heated Labor indignation used its numbers in parliament's lower house on Monday to rush through its repeal legislation.
It laid aside the original repeal bill, which the Senate previously had amended heavily, and replaced it with new legislation initially described as relating to tax, superannuation, social security and family assistance.
Essentially, it was a bill that repealed the "failed" mining tax, plus a range of associated measures including the low-income superannuation contribution (saving $3.6 billion), the income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and the schoolkids bonus ($4.7 billion).
Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer was dismissive of the government move.
"Ill-conceived mining tax repeal bill wont pass Senate without low income super contribution, income support bonus & the schoolkids bonus," he tweeted.
The government needs the support of PUP and other crossbenchers to have its bill clear the Senate against opposition from Labor and the Greens.
Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove parliament's ability to decide the rate of the superannuation compulsory guarantee, giving all the authority to the treasurer to determine any changes.
"This is outrageous," he told reporters in Canberra.
It would allow the government to delay further increases, pushing out Labor's desired target of 12 per cent rate to as far as 2034.
"That is completely unacceptable and the Labor party of course will oppose that all the way," Mr Bowen said.
The rate is now 9.5 per cent, but the government wants the treasurer to have the power to pause further increases.
Man's body found on Brighton beach
The dead man, who has not been identified, was retrieved before high tide at 2pm by officers from Sussex Police who cordoned off the area, which was close to the start of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
Police officers and the coroner's officers are working to establish the circumstances of how the body came to be there.
The man has not been identified yet.
Detectives are to check missing persons reports to find out whether any are connected to the dead man.
Officers were unable to confirm if the death was suspicious.
Mexico Police: Accidental Blast Kills 1 on Border
Police in Piedras Negras say that an apparently accidental explosion in a customs building on Mexico's border with the U.S. has killed one woman and injured five other people.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the director of operations for the local municipal police in the city on the border with Texas.
He tells The Associated Press that the woman who died in the Sunday blast suffered a fractured skull and the other five people had burns.
Lopez Arenas says the blast occurred in the morning in a dormitory for customs agents.
The cause of the explosion is under investigation, but authorities believe it was caused by an accumulation of gas.
The explosion did not affect border operations.
Three Atlantic City Casinos to Close in September
Three Atlantic City Casinos Will Go Dark This Month
A man gambles at the Showboat casino, which is scheduled to close, in Atlantic City, N.J., on July 29, 2014
September is expected to be hard month for Atlantic City, as three of its casinos deal out their last hands
Three casinos will close this month in Atlantic City, N.J., signaling that this metropolis of neon lights and blinking slot machines can no longer bet on gaming revenues.
More than 5,000 workers will be out of a job when the casinos Showboat and Revel close this weekend, the Associated Press reports.
Even more will lose their livelihoods when the Trump Plaza cuts its lights.
The expected closure of the three casinos, one of which is just two years old, is the latest slap to this city, coming just eight months after the Atlantic Club ran out of luck.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city's casino workforce, or 8,000 people, will be out of work, the New York Times reports.
When New Jersey legalized gaming in 1976, casinos were marketed as a sure bet for economically battered Atlantic City, the AP reports.
But the regional gaming market has since become flush with competitors, with casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania claiming chunks of the once prodigious profits flowing into Atlantic City.
Even Massachusetts, a once gaming-averse state, is eyeing a share of the rewards, as it flirts with inviting three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva’s new schedule hard to accept
Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) says it finds it difficult to accept the new estimation from the facility supplier Areva, according to which the third reactor of Olkiluoto will only be available for commercial use in 2018.
Jouni Silvennoinen, the director of the power station project, says that the reason for this is for example the fact that the construction is largely complete, and the amount of uncompleted work is known.
TVO continues assessing the information received from Areva.
Mr. Silvennoinen says in his statement that TVO welcomes all initiatives which allow the project to be accelerated.
Areva provided TVO with the updated schedule concerning the Olkiluoto 3 today, and according to the schedule the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016, and the commercial activity could start in 2018.
According to Areva’s statement, the project’s latest delays are due mainly to the acceptance of the automation system of the reactor. The acceptance was obtained in April.
It was preceded by negotiations with TVO which took four years.
Originally, Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time after another.
TVO and Areva have been quarrelling about who is responsible for the delay for years.
The dispute has been taken to the Court of Arbitration, and Areva has demanded no less than 2.7 billion euros in damages from TVO.
TVO considers Areva’s claims unfounded, and is demanding approximately 1.8 billion euros from the company.
Energy and Water Communities Must Cooperate to Meet Global Challenges
Global leaders gathered in Stockholm today for the 24th annual World Water Week, urging the energy and water communities to work together to face some of the main challenges of our time, providing clean drinking water and energy for a growing world population.
The theme of 2014 World Water Week is "Energy and Water."
Water and energy are interdependent in more ways than not.
We need energy for pumping, storing, transporting and treating water, we need water for producing almost all sorts of energy.
An increase or decrease in one will immediately affect the other.
The two resources are also inseparable from sustainable development and must be tirelessly promoted in global decision-making.
Addressing the opening session of the Week, Mr. Torgny Holmgren, Executive Director of World Water Week organiser Stockholm International Water Institute, said: "The challenges are immense."
With the global demand for water projected to grow by 55 per cent between 2000 and 2050 and electricity demand expected to increase by 50 per cent in the next two decades, there is an urgent need for a closer relationship between the energy and water communities if we are to provide solutions for all peoples to prosper.
Professor John Briscoe, this year's Stockholm Water Prize laureate, spoke about water as a platform for growth, both of other sectors and society as a whole, and said that "developing countries face big challenges.
They have yet to mobilise those resources.
He added that there is "no eternal solution [to the water crisis], neither here nor there."
Instead, there is a cycle of challenges and responses.
In over 100 seminars, workshops and events spread throughout the week, delegates will discuss ongoing and future work and collaboration between the energy and water communities.
Professor John Briscoe, a native of South Africa, will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, during a ceremony in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a policy institute that generates knowledge and informs decision-makers towards water wise policy and sustainable development.
Shipping Dead Foreigners' Bodies in Miami: The Cost of Flying Corpses
In October 2012 a raft carrying twenty-three Cuban refugees on its way to Miami capsized and a reported fourteen people drowned.
It had happened to hundreds more before them, and they surely will not be the last.
Every year more than 1,000 Central Americans die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.
The transnational city is a place to die for.
Ironically, however, once established in the transnational city, few envision staying there until their last breath.
For many, it is a temporary venue, whether as a place of exile, a springboard for upward mobility, or a playground until new opportunities beckon.
Few imagine dying there and, as the moment draws near, many make plans to go home.
In the transnational city, which is home to a disproportionate number of the foreign-born and expatriates, death and repatriation are a steady business.
The bodies of an estimated 20 percent of South Florida's deceased are shipped out, more than from any other region in the USA.
Most of the HRs (industry shorthand for human remains) going abroad depart from Miami International Airport.
According to the CEO of Pierson, a leader in this business since 1964, around 80 percent of business is international, with the company shipping to a range of foreign destinations across Central and South America and a number of European countries as well.

As more and more migrants move to transnational cities, they too die there.
And even in death, there are still costs to return home.
Miami is the hub for American Airlines in Latin America, and the figures in the table are the airline's rates for repatriating human remains in 2013.
The cost of shipping a body is not cheap, ranging from about $500 to well into the thousands of dollars.
The requirements for the shipment and delivery of HRs also vary for religious, cultural, and public health reasons.
Given the expense and the lack of government assistance to repatriate the dead, who are often young and uninsured, immigrant communities in transnational cities sometimes organize burial societies to help offset costs.
The origins of some credit unions and informal health insurance programs can be traced back to such societies established by Italians, Jews, and Greeks in New York, who were among the first transnationals in America.
Newer generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos, and Bangladeshis are now doing the same in several transnational cities.
Source: American Airlines
Clearly, dying abroad does not come without complications because few expats intend or plan to make the transnational city their eternal home.
For instance, in Dubai, in the absence of a will for a deceased expat, Sharia law is applied and supersedes the laws governing inheritance in the deceased's home country.
All assets, if there are any, are frozen and subsequently dispersed at the discretion of the Sharia court.
The extent of the human remains repatriation network (c.
2013) of the Dublin-based airline Aer Lingus reflects the transnational character of the city and of the Irish.
At one time discontinued, the human remains service was reinstated by the airline in 2004 after condemnation by emigrant groups.
The thought of dying rarely enters the minds of those passing through or living in a transnational city.
On the contrary, becoming an expat or immigrant in the transnational city is an open declaration about how one views life, not death.
Yet it is in the approach of death that the transnational city offers the foreign-born its most stark and ultimate choices of belonging--between the local and global, between cosmos and earth, and between the transient and eternal.
Centre Party and Left Alliance submit an interpellation concerning inequality
The opposition parties Centre Party and Left Alliance are going to submit to the government an interpellation concerning the subsistence of the persons with low income, and the increasing inequality.
The parties want to instigate debate about people’s subsistence problems, which are culminating due to the weak economy development and the worsening unemployment.
The parties point out in their statement that the growing inequality can also be seen between different parts of the country, as well as within big cities.
According to the parties, the cuts and tax increases in the government’s budget for the next year are targeting the people with low income, such as the students, the unemployed, and the pensioners, people with families, and ordinary workers, while for example food, medicines, and living continue becoming more expensive.
The reality is that there are nearly half million people unemployed now, the parties say in their statement.
Also the subsistence problems of the people in employment have worsened.
The parliamentary groups of the Centre Party and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, The Finns Party, has declared previously that it will submit an interpellation concerning the resources of the police and the internal security.
The autumn session of the parliament starts tomorrow (Tuesday).
NYC's Huge West Indian Day Parade Set to Step Off
Caribbean culture is set to get its annual spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day Parade is one of the year's biggest outdoor events - and political see-and-be-seen spots.
The annual parade is set for Monday in Brooklyn.
It echoes traditional pre-Lenten Carnival festivities and features dancers wearing elaborate, often feathered costumes.
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams is this year's grand marshal, but expect plenty of other political faces in the lineup.
The parade is a prime place for officeholders and candidates to greet the public the week before Primary Day.
For all the festivity, the parade weekend also has been scarred in recent years by violence nearby.
Police have said they're taking steps to keep the event safe, such as keeping tabs on any gang activity.
Is it worth asking a rhetorical question?
Everyone knows about rhetorical questions, don't they?
Don't answer that.
This figure of speech - a question that does not anticipate an answer but implies one - peppers everything from the highest-flown oratory to everyday conversational exchanges.
The opening of Cicero's famous denunciation of Catiline is a run of rhetorical questions, starting: "When, O Catiline, do you mean to cease abusing our patience?"
So are my arguments with my wife: "What's wrong with reheating five-day-old chicken for the kids?"
Why are you so uptight?
The fancy term for rhetorical questions is erotema.
Their virtue is in taking what might be an open question and forcing the audience to accept it as a given.
They imply, sneakily, that nobody sane could possibly disagree.
The author of a 19th-century composition manual, David Williams, described them as "a mode of address admirably calculated to produce a powerful impression of the truth of a subject, as it challenges the impossibility of contradiction."
The Art of Persuasion
You can string them together for more ambitious effects.
A succession of rhetorical questions designed to express grief or indignation is called epiplexis.
You find these in Job's appeals to the Almighty: "Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress . . .?
Hast thou eyes of flesh?
Or seest thou as man seeth?
Also in comments from my wife: "Why did you give the children food poisoning?
Are you mad?
Can't you do anything right?
Or there's hypophora, which is where you ask a question and immediately answer it.
A fine example is furnished by Isaac Hayes: "Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
Shaft!
Ya damn right!
Who's the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
Also, my wife: "What's the one thing they've eaten that could have made them sick?"
That chicken.
Which idiot fed it to them?
You.
Oddly, however, despite rhetoric being the art of persuasion, a rhetorical question is often not all that persuasive.
If you are in the business of talking someone round, rather than preaching to the converted or railing against the obdurate, you should use rhetorical questions with caution.
They are better at consolidating assent than winning it.
If your audience agrees with the proposition - "Isn't it nice it's so sunny?" - a rhetorical question signals the speaker's confidence in that and so, as it were, binds speaker and audience closer.
But it will only do that if you are sure there is no room for dissent.
By presuming on agreement rather than asking for it, you can sound, well, presumptuous.
In other circumstances, rhetorical questions indicate the weak point in an argument.
Where they appear in newspaper headlines they are all too often obvious as the strongest available statement of a very weak case: "Did aliens build the pyramids?"
In both instances they are vulnerable to the straightforward takedown of giving an answer, and not the one implied.
"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was the high-risk general election campaign slogan of the British Conservative party in 2005.
It lost.
To some, spotting this sort of thing has become a hobby, and QTWAIN (Questions To Which Answer Is No) - popularised by British journalist John Rentoul - has taken hold.
Some years ago a friend ran a competition to find the best examples.
The clear winner was "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?," as sung by pop star Gary Glitter - before he was revealed to be a child-sex offender.
The writer is the author of "You Talkin" to Me?"
Researcher: the time of a federation compromise may be over
In the beginning of the conflict the thought was that a federation could be a some kind of compromise for the conflict, Saari says.
Earlier, in an interview with a Russian channel, Russian President Vladimir Putin said reaching the peace in the eastern Ukraine requires talks on the statehood of the area.
In practice, this would mean some sort of autonomy in eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of the people living in the eastern part.
Saari says Ukraine’s change into a federation is in a certain way a priority among the objectives Russia is aiming at.
Ukraine suspects, probably for a reason, that Russia would attempt to affect Ukraine’s internal affairs, he says.
If the federation solution can’t be reached, an alternative, from Russia’s point of view, could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia virtually would have the control over Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimates.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both arms and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the claims, even if the pro-Russian insurgents have themselves told that ”volunteering Russian soldiers on a leave” have been fighting among them.
FIIA’s director: An influential office for Katainen has been planned
Tiilikainen reminds that the job is a new one, and still in the making.
She says the idea is that Katainen would in some manner coordinate, or even lead commission’s work in the matters concerning competitiveness and employment.
One of the focus areas in the commission’s new season is of course the competitiveness and the employment of the Union.
In that way we are in the heart of the power of the commission, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen’s background, economic skills, and role during the economic crisis give him the opportunity to reach a good position within the commission.
According to the plans, the office would be without Portfolio, i.e. Katainen wouldn’t be managing any main department of his own.
Katainen would become a team leader instead in the field of EU’s competitiveness and employment, and in that case, besides the Portfolio of the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, he also might have other related Portfolios to coordinate.
In practice, leading a team might mean for example planning and instructing.
Soldiers’ Mothers: even 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia, even 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and currently the country is hosting over 7,000 Russian soldiers.
Human rights organisations say at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
The committee says the hospital of the city of Rostov near Ukraine’s border is crowded with persons wounded in the war in Ukraine.
The Soldiers’ Mothers collect their information from the soldiers’ relatives.
The military alliance Nato has estimated there are over 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB Andte on his alcohol consumption: ”After a little shot the talking starts”
Big Brother On Monday evening, Jussi and Andte ended up contemplating the life in the BB house.
Jussi, who’s on the basement side, was pedalling the exercise bicycle on Monday evening, chatting with Andte, who is one of the inhabitants of the Mansion.
The duo was wondering what does the audience think about their actions, how they see it.
You don’t know before you’ve seen, Andte said.
Jussi thinks that the most of the time in the BB house goes to waiting and killing time.
The possible parties or tasks are only a fraction of the life in the BB house.
You’re mostly waiting and wondering and chatting and just living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The Mansion people spent the Wednesday evening within a liquid framework, and the alcohol made especially Andte talkative.
In fact, Jussi enquired him if the parties had made the man’s life in the house more meaningful now when he, being a little tipsy, has been able to chit-chat with other contestants.
When you take a little shot the talking starts, Andte admitted.
Watch Andte’s interview on ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals her ideal body in Me Naiset
Anna Abreu tells in Me Naiset magazine she decided to lose weight two years ago when she took a pause from touring.
At that time, Anna was tired of touring, and thought that along with the weight loss she would gain more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
A couple of years ago Anna was dreaming about the body type of Victoria’s Secret models.
My ideal body looked like that of a Victoria’s Secret model.
I wanted to look good, and I thought that I wanted to lose weight, Anna tells the magazine.
Anna displays her trained body at gigs and in the music videos, but says that she doesn’t work out like crazy, even if she’s been depicted as someone doing so.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, who has a very fit body, goes to the gym and practices boxing.
Visible muscles aren’t important, but the fact that I’ll manage to lift a certain amount of weight at the gym, Anna says.
Every once in a while the pop star gives herself a permission to indulge with food.
If I indulge with food, I really do so.
Sometimes I overeat in an unhealthy way, without thinking whether I just gained weight.
Instead I’m wondering what my body is thinking.
I feel disgusted if I hurt my body somehow.
Terhi Ylimäinen
Anna tells she’s comfortable in her body.
Corporate pruning pleases shareholders but fails to stimulate growth
Are the chief executives of Australia's listed companies turning into a bunch of crowd-pleasers, bowing to shareholders' desire for higher dividends and to engage in share buybacks?
Could it be that the balance of power has shifted from the boardrooms to the shareholders they serve?
The evidence is clear from last week's close of the 2014 reporting season that dividends are king.
Those companies that have rewarded investors with buybacks and bigger dividend payouts have had strongly performing share prices.
Nothing wrong with that.
However, the flip side of this coin is that aggregate capital expenditure is declining at a greater rate than analysts have forecast - an outcome that leads one to wonder if there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and not enough on medium- and longer-term growth.
Sure, some companies are returning money to their shareholders and financing their businesses by other means.
For example, there is an increase in the amount of finance being obtained in the cheaper corporate bond market.
From a company's perspective, this makes sense because debt, today, is historically cheap and equity is not.
However, even if we back out the funds raised in debt markets it is clear that this generosity towards shareholders is primarily being financed by companies spending less on investment.
The net result of this wave of buybacks (and the cancelling of dividend reinvestment programs) is that the number of equities in the Australian market is decreasing.
Credit Suisse has called it the "de-equitising reporting season," in which companies are trying hard to keep their share numbers down.
As part of the same theme, companies are raising less equity.
The count from the reporting season is $3.7 billion worth of buybacks and $1.5 billion worth of expected equity raisings that did not happen.
Credit Suisse goes so far as to use the headline 'Capex is a dirty word' in one of its reports.
Although we now have the numbers to support the fact that this trend is clear, the anecdotal evidence has been with us for months.
It was sufficient for Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens to remark a few weeks ago that businesses needs a bit more "animal spirits" to push them into investment.
Stevens is not concerned about individual company's prospects but rather the aggregate impact on the economy because sluggish capital expenditure augurs badly for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says: "Bottom-up capex estimates have come down by an average of 4 per cent over two years for reporting companies.
Free cash-flow estimates have gone up by an average of 2 per cent.
Improving cash flow is likely to fuel further de-equitisation.
All this gives a snapshot that looks good for current shareholders and for the sharemarket, but it does suggest at least a hint of corporate expediency.
Indeed, if I had $1 for every chief executive who remarked over the years that the short-term share price was not a concern then... well, you know the rest.
Of course, this statement is a nonsense.
CEOs pay very close attention to their share price and are extremely concerned about fluctuations in it.
Their short-term and long-term bonus incentive packages are priced relative to the value of stock, and their tenure depends on it.
What they really mean is that some corporate decisions (be they acquisitions, increased organic investment or dividend payments) are not always immediately popular but they are better for medium-term strategy.
Indeed, corporate bosses regularly, and rightly, bemoan the fact that investment markets have a very short-term horizon.
This is why this current bout of conservatism feels like a cave-in to short-term interests.
For those that are assessing cheap debt markets and rationing equity, the concern does not apply, but it was all too clear in the reporting season just gone that there was a particular emphasis on rationing future capital expenditure and plenty of brownie points to be awarded for the tightest corporate wallets.
The large miners like BHP and Rio Tinto led the charge in cutting capex, but there were plenty of others; some because they needed to, but others that were just mindful of their shareholders' response.
So why are investors exerting so much pressure on companies to give them a dividend yield?
Credit Suisse strategist Hasan Tevfik says the obvious answer is that the shareholders have become more income seeking, given falling returns from traditional fixed-income products as (perversely) central banks worldwide have lowered interest rates as they flood the market with liquidity.
Thus investors have been pushed into the equity market in search of a return and, in turn, have applied pressure on companies to provide it.
Shareholders are also making it pretty clear to companies that they are nor prepared to fund what they consider risky investments, whose returns are uncertain.
They would rather have the money in their wallets as they head, increasingly, towards retirement.
The statistics from the latest reporting season clearly demonstrate that much of the earnings growth was the result of cost cutting, rather than revenue growth.
Nude celebrity picture leak looks like phishing or email account hack
The leak of pictures and, allegedly, videos of Jennifer Lawrence by an unknown hacker has security experts - and Apple - puzzled.
Though the hacker has posted a list of scores of female celebrities to a chatroom claiming to have more pictures of them, a number of those named have come forward to say that photos claimed to be of them are faked, while others claim they were deleted.
The list of those allegedly affected is long, and includes Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and the American actress Mary E Winstead.
With any hack, the principal questions are: what was the avenue of attack?
And where were the photos and videos - if they were real - downloaded from?
The most headline-grabbing possibility for the source of the photos - a full-on frontal-assault ground-up hack of Apple's iCloud service - is also the least likely.
Large companies like Apple have dedicated in-house security teams who attempt to break into their own systems regularly.
"A wide scale "hack" of Apple's iCloud is unlikely.
Even the original poster is not claiming that," noted Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security research at Trend Micro.
As with the many celebrity hacks (and daily hacks that affect less famous people), the simpler and more likely explanation is the leak of an email and password combination, either through guesswork or "phishing," when users are fooled by authentic-looking sites into entering their login details, which are then used against them.
Apple is still investigating what is claimed to be an attack on its iCloud service, which is used by iPhone users to store settings and, crucially, which backs up photos taken with the phone to "cloud" servers.
If you have a user's email address and password for their iCloud service, you can log in to their account and download those photos and other details.
The only block to that is if the account owner has enabled "two-factor authentication" (2FA) - an extra layer of security that will send a code to the owner's phone before it allows login.
Comparatively few people use 2FA, however, either because they don't know about it or find it cumbersome.
Apple is still investigating whether the data was all taken from its iCloud service and, if so, to what extent users" accounts were compromised.
The company had no statement at the time of publication.
Ferguson suggests that the hacker may have used the "forgot password" link on Apple's iCloud system after gathering the celebrities" email addresses - perhaps from the address book of another hacked device.
Alternatively, the stars used the same password on multiple services, which were captured through that.
Lawrence's publicist says the photos are real, though not how old they are.
In a tweet, Winstead suggested a longstanding effort by the hacker.
Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this.
Feeling for everyone who got hacked," she wrote.
However the independent security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that she had deleted the photos from her phone - but with modern smartphones, deleting a picture from the phone does not always mean that no copies exist.
Modern smartphones routinely save photos to the cloud because they often lack enough capacity for the huge number of photos that people take.
Apple's iPhone by default saves photos to iCloud; Google's Android to its Google+ service; Microsoft's Windows Phone to its OneDrive service.
Third-party services such as Dropbox also offer automated photo and data backups.
"People take photos and zap them, but don't realise that they are being uploaded," Cluley told the Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Deleted doesn't always mean deleted," he notes.
Those photos and videos can remain stored for years.
If someone then gets hold of a user's email and password, they can re-download all the photos - and also any videos that might have been sent by email.
For an Apple device, the photos can be downloaded on to a Mac or Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker posted a screenshot claiming to be of so-far unreleased videos and images taken on a Windows PC.
"Two-factor authentication" protects against such hacks because it requires anyone setting up a copy of an existing account on a new device to enter a code that is sent to the primary device - usually a phone.
Without that, access is blocked.
Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all offer two-factor authentication on accounts, though it is not known how many, if any, of the affected celebrities used it.
Others have claimed that pictures allegedly of them are not authentic.
A representative for Ariana Grande said the photos said to be of her are "completely fake."
Victoria Justice also tweeted that the "so called nudes of me are FAKE people.
Let me nip this in the bud right now *pun intended*
Cluley points to another possibility.
Because those involved are celebrities, their accounts might have been hacked through someone who was handling their social media accounts or who regularly deals with their emails.
"I wonder whether the agencies or some minion might be some part of this," he mused.
However, the stars named do not share a single publicist or management agency.
Another possibility is that someone who set up one or more of the victims" systems, or helped configure one, secretly altered it so that any data would be passed back to them.
That happened in the case of the "Hollywood hacker" Christopher Chaney, from Florida, who spread photos from Scarlettt Johansson and Mila Kunis's email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in jail in December 2012 and ordered to pay more than $66,000 in restitution.
Chaney was accused of illegally accessing the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011; in one instance he sent an email from the account of Aguilera's stylist to the star, asking for scantily clad photos, and then posted them online.
Afterwards Chaney apologised, saying that his actions were "probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience."
It was also claimed he had stalked two people online for more than ten years.
Cluley said: "In the Chaney case, the stars had their email accounts hacked, and they were being altered so that somebody kept being forwarded their data even when the password changed."
He said that the obsessive behaviour of those who try to hack such accounts was like "butterfly collectors."
They just like to collect this stuff.
Perhaps what has happened here is that someone stumbled across a stash of these accounts and logins on somewhere like Dropbox.
Or they have been at work for a long time to get at them.
Or they hacked someone's email account and got at their address book, and then phished other people.
My suspicion is that this isn't an iCloud security flaw as such.
Australia has offered its intelligence resources to help the United Nations track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped by al-Qaeda linked terrorists in Syria.
It's believed the 44 Fijian peacekeepers are being held by the terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra, who overran a Golan Heights crossing last week and forced the UN troops to surrender.
They've been missing since Wednesday and their whereabouts is unknown.
The incident has deeply troubled ministers attending the UN Small Island Developing States conference in Samoa, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.
Ms Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon at the summit, and has offered Australia's support to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I've assured them that Australia is providing whatever support we can, including our intelligence resources, to assist the UN," she told AAP from Samoa on Monday.
We are keeping in very close contact with all of our partners and friends in the intelligence network ... to make sure we can locate them and they are safe.
Ms Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia would use its seat on the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
It comes amid reports that a group of Filipino peacekeepers confined to their barracks in a different part of the disputed region had escaped.
The UN has been monitoring the Golan Heights since a ceasefire between Syria and Israel in 1974.
Scammers using carbon tax repeal to steal your money, ACCC warns
SCAMMERS are taking advantage of the carbon tax repeal and trying to steal your money, the ACCC warns.
The consumer watchdog's SCAMwatch unit has issued a warning to consumers and businesses to be wary of too-good-to-be-true offers from people pretending to be from government agencies, offering thousands of dollars in compensation.
Scammers may take advantage of dollar figures being quoted in the media about how much consumers may save from changes in the price of goods following the carbon tax repeal, offering up to $7000, the warning states.
They might sound convincing too, having already researched some of your personal details and using them to convince you to hand over your bank details or pay a fee.
Scammers are using topical issues to dupe you.
It's not just the carbon tax scammers are using to seize your cash, their schemes are growing more sophisticated, using topical issues and building their scams around them.
The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired scammers.
The ACCC warns if you have any doubts about the identity of a caller claiming to represent a business, call the business back contacting them directly through your own search - don't rely on contact details supplied by the caller.
If you receive a phone call or email out of the blue from someone claiming to be from a government department or business such as an energy provider and they claim that you are entitled to money due to the carbon tax repeal, be cautious.
If you think you have been duped and may have given details or transferred money to a scammer, contact your financial institution immediately.
And if the offer sounds too good to be true, like the government giving your free cash, it probably is.
Taloussanomat: Lipponen criticises the EU sanctions against Russia
In an interview with Taloussanomat, the former prime minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions EU has imposed against Russia.
Russia’s focus in the politics is to pursue its own interests.
The sanctions won’t necessarily affect this,” Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started working as investigator for the businesses in Arctic regions in the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK).
He’s worried, because the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended the project financing in Russia as part of the EU’s economical sanctions.
”For example, it means that the environment projects for the northern dimension, which clearly have prospects, are going to be frozen,” Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of the financing is going to obstruct the cooperation, the reconstruction of which might be difficult if there is no trust, Lipponen says.
However, he believes that the Finnish businesses’ interest in the Arctic Ocean cooperation projects will continue as strong as before.
Currently he’s working on a report for EK about Finland’s policy with regards to Arctic and the business opportunities in the North.
Acute situation in Ukraine or in Russia has no effect on that.
The report looks far forward, we’re talking about dozens of years,” he says.
It is rare that a ringed seal comes to shallow waters or near human settlements, says Vesa Heinonen, the nature educationalist of the Nature Centre of the Ostrobothnian Museum.
Today (Sunday), near the shore in Vaasa’s Suvilahti, a ring seal was seen swimming around.
Mr. Heinonen says that the ring seal has probably come to Suvilahti in search for food.
It’s not confused.
This means there is fish in the area, Mr. Heinonen advises.
He says that for example at the Sundom bridge, especially during spring and autumn, you can see ring seals who come there exactly because they’re following the fish.
Still, the ring seal is not a common species in the maritime zone of Vaasa.
You can see ring seals in Maksamaa, in front of the villas, he continues.
The ring seal lives for example in the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, and in the Archipelago Sea.
SA court told murdered pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive, violent outside nightclub
Murdered SA man and pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga.
Pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive toward both his partner and a security guard minutes before he was killed outside a city nightclub, a court has heard.
Lawyers for Mr Vallelonga's alleged killer today asked the Adelaide Magistrates Court to release their client on bail, saying it was "clear" he had acted in self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, for the man - whose identity is suppressed - said the incident was insufficiently serious to warrant her client remaining behind bars until trial.
"The evidence demonstrates the deceased was engaged in aggressive conduct to the point he had to be ejected from a nightclub," she said.
After this there was an altercation resulting in one particular security guard having his shirt ripped ... by this drunken 40-year-old man.
Importantly, when the prosecution says death resulted from one punch, this evidence raises fairly and squarely the question of self-defence or defence of another.
The man, 25, has yet to plead to one count of murder.
Mr Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious with serious head injuries near the corner of Rundle St and Synagogue Place about 2.25am on May 4.
He died in Royal Adelaide Hospital, as a result of his injuries, early the next day - leaving friends and customers mourning the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
Prosecutors have alleged the alleged killer's actions were unprovoked and, after the incident, he told a taxi driver he had "put someone to sleep for a few days."
Today, Ms Shaw said CCTV footage of the incident painted events in a different light.
"It confirms aggressive behaviour by the deceased ... his partner was trying to placate him and was herself being dealt with roughly and harshly (by him)," she said.
Our client has not only the presumption of innocence but now a positive defence of self-defence that will be put (at trial).
Prosecutors opposed the man's release, saying three security guards were present on the night of the incident and only one had complained about Mr Vallelonga.
They said the other guards were unconcerned about him as he was "short," and wrote off his verbal abuse as that of "a 100m hero" who did not want a physical confrontation.
They said a taxi driver would give evidence that, based on his "unobstructed" view of the incident, Mr Vallelonga was punched "forcefully" and had no chance to defend himself.
Magistrate Elizabeth Sheppard remanded the man in custody until next week, when she will announce her decision.
Controversial dolphin hunt begins in Japan - justified as tradition - World News - Ilta-Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to delay the beginning of the hunt which has been widely condemned globally.
The annual dolphin hunt season started again on Monday in the Japanese city Taiji.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
British newspaper The Guardian, among others, tells about the hunt which has been largely opposed around the world.
In the hunt, the hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote cove, and after the most suitable ones have been selected to be taken to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world, the mammals will be slaughtered.
Dolphin meat will end up also in the food production.
However, according to the local authorities, the beginning of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
The practice became known globally in 2009, when “The Cove”, a documentary film about the hunt was released.
During the previous hunting seasons, the hunt has been criticised by animal rights activists, and also by diplomats.
According to the protesters, the dolphin meat has in any case limited markets due to its high mercury concentrations.
According to the promoters, including Japan’s government, the hunt is a tradition.
The supporters have also reminded that the dolphins aren’t endangered.
Demonstrations against the dolphin hunt were organised in several countries already over the weekend.
According to the protesters in Tokyo, the hunt damages Japan’s reputation around the world.
Also in Helsinki there was a demonstration in front of Japan’s embassy on Monday.
Some Nato countries uncertain about positioning new troops in eastern Europe
There are divergent opinions within military alliance Nato on whether Nato bases should be created in the eastern Europe and in the Baltics, as a response to Ukraine crisis, newspaper Financial Times reports.
Poland and Estonia have requested the military alliance to bring troops to their countries permanently, but Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has been against the plan.
“What Ukraine has done is put a new perspective Russia’s policy, and it is threatening to overturn the European security,” Michael Clarke, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute in London said to Financial Times.
Nato members will meet next week, and the military alliance’s objective is to release its new readiness action plan.
The key issue of the plan is whether Nato can breach the CFE Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces, which was signed in 1990.
In the treaty Nato and Warsaw Pact agreed on how to position armed forces in the territory between Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains.
According to the Financial Times, the treaty prevents in practice new military bases in the eastern Europe and in the Baltics.
Russia itself declared a moratorium on the treaty in 2007, but the country didn’t actually dissociate itself from it.
Due to the tense situation in Ukraine, Nato is pondering whether the treaty terms still need to be abided by.
”Nato assets must be positioned in all Nato countries that require them,” Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of Britain’s parliamentary intelligence and security committee said to Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller becomes youngest teen to fly around the world
At a time when most teens are starting to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19-year-old recently became the youngest pilot ever to circumnavigate the globe, and he did it alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
The South Dakota teenager flew 30,000 miles, making 23 stops in 15 countries on five continents.
Along the way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star for his record-breaking flight.
He also heard what the critics had to say.
"It's too risky" or "This is some spoiled, rich brat going out and having a good time."
He said he didn't have much to say to his critics.
It was certainly a lot of fun and I had a good time, but it was a lot of work and I hope that what I did inspires other people to go out and do big things.
He was inspired to pilot a plane at an early age, first asking his parents to eat at airport cafes.
Later he pushed for flying lessons.
They agreed to let me do this little $20, 20-minute intro flight, but I think they probably thought that was going to be the end of that.
It wasn't.
He soon made a deal to get more time in the cockpit.
A little arrangement where I would share a car with my dad throughout high school instead of having my own car.
In exchange, I got to fly planes.
By the age of 17, he had his pilot's license and two years later leased a single-engine Beechcraft for his solo flight around the world.
The MIT student performed plane maintenance and his own fuel calculations.
Long hours in the air meant some additional fuel for him as well.
Basically, a lot of caffeine and Oreos.
He said he went through a few rows of Oreos during one of the long legs of his flight.
Flying into the clouds was both beautiful and dangerous.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have the weather radar to help him navigate around thunderstorms.
I have no idea which clouds were just a little bit higher than where I'm at and which ones go up to 45,000 feet and will break the plane apart.
He was flying a plane that was not pressurized and didn't have oxygen, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
And with a bunch of fuel it's hard to get up any higher.
One day after our interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after crashing his plane on what Guthmiller called the most difficult leg of his own journey -- American Samoa to Hawaii.
Guthmiller flew from the same airstrip as Suleman and said the take-off is technically challenging because of the heavy fuel load needed for the 16-hour stretch.
In spite of the risks and even a fear of heights, Guthmiller succeeded in breaking the record and raising money for computer science education through Code.org.
He is a coder himself, who started his own tech company at the age of 12.
His goals are more than sky high.
I think it would be really cool to start the next Apple, but we'll see how that goes.
He said he is aiming high.
Shoot for the stars, you can get somewhere good.
Finding the right franchisee is more difficult than you think
When a reality show about her business called The Cupcake Girls aired on the W Network in 2009, Lori Joyce was thrilled to find fans lining up at Cupcakes by Heather and Lori locations across Canada.
That is until she found out that one franchisee wasn't up to the task.
"There was a franchisee sitting in her car calling me because she has 100 potential customers lined up ready to buy a cupcake, and she couldn't handle it," said Ms. Joyce.
That was a really big eye opener for me, because it was a really big missed opportunity for us.
After that incident Ms. Joyce decided to change her franchise partner screening process, switching her focus from finding talented bakers to finding talented leaders that emanate the company's culture.
"Everyone can do a good interview... they know what I want to hear," she said, adding that she's conducted approximately 100 for each of her 11 franchise locations.
We have six weeks of training, but they behave completely differently once they're in their environment, so it's really tricky, and as a result my training really heavily emphasizes cultural fit.
Finding the right franchisee is vital for the development of any small businesses.
While a strong and honest leader can help shape and grow the organization, a poor fit can do costly damage to an established company.
"I used to think looking for a franchisee was like dating, but it's not like that at all, because when you date you can do a whole lot to get to know each other before you get married," said Ms. Joyce.
But with franchising you literally sign a franchise agreement, receive a deposit and build out a store.
It's a significant jump and a major test of trust entering that partnership with someone before seeing them perform.
Like a strong marriage, franchisors and franchisees need to enter a symbiotic relationship built on common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association.
She therefore believes that it's just as important for the franchisee to vet their prospective franchisor before entering such a long-term relationship.
"Just as its true in a personal relationship, if they're rude to you when you're dating, can you imagine what they'll be like when you're married?" she said.
It's equally as important for both parties to be vetting, evaluating, and paying attention to any warning flags they get from either side.
Ms. McLachlan adds that franchisors like Ms. Joyce can take what they've learned from the successes and failures of past partnerships, but first-time franchisors need to be more diligent in taking on those vital first partners.
New franchisors instead need to take the lessons of their presumably successful corporate location to determine what challenges they've had to overcome, and what skill sets franchisees will require when facing similar obstacles.
First time franchisers can also work with a franchise consultant to devise a profile based on industry norms.
Ms. McLachlan adds that there are a variety of resources for first-time franchisors and franchisees available on the CFA's website, lookforafranchise.ca.
The process gets easier over time, however, not only because franchisors become better practiced at vetting potential franchisees, but because their first few franchisors can act as an advisory board moving forward.
"The first franchise partner was very instrumental in helping Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1800-GOT-JUNK?) build the business and the franchise system," said Erik Church, COO of O2E Brands, which include 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me, and Wow 1 Day Painting.
They helped create something that Brain couldn't have created on his own, so if you're looking for your first franchise partners, think of them that way.
Mr. Church oversees 216 franchises across O2E's three brands, and is also the Toronto franchise partner of You Move Me.
When it comes to finding the right franchise partner, Mr. Church uses a very straightforward method.
"The one litmus test that's held true for us is, "would I want to invite this person over to my house for a barbecue over the weekend?"" he said.
"If the answer is "no" to that, chances are you're not going to want to spend a lot of time with them during the day working through challenging business problems."
Mr. Church adds that much of the O2E Brands" success has resulted from its franchise structure.
While managers in a corporate structure might see their position as short term and their relationship with superiors as highly formalized, franchisees buy into the business with a longer-term focus, and are therefore more vested in the success of the business.
"There are so many more upsides to having a franchise partner than having a corporate setup, but with that comes a more intensive relationship," he said.
It's not a relationship between a VP and an operations manager, it's a partnership.
It's a much more difficult relationship, but it bares much more fruit when managed well.
Rail delays knock north US grain prices
Protracted rail shipping delays have led to deep discounts for grain prices in the north central US, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new stress.
Commercial silos in North Dakota are offering farmers only $2.70 a bushel for corn - about $1 less than benchmark prices - due mainly to the costs of securing capacity on adjacent tracks, traders and agricultural groups said.
IN Commodities
Problems are most acute on the BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and Canadian Pacific railroads.
A federal railroad regulator will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
Far from river barge networks, northern plains states rely heavily on railroads to move agricultural commodities.
Rail delays lengthened after a bumper 2013 crop was followed by an extremely cold winter that slowed and shortened trains.
Some farmers suspect railroads" rising shipments of crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale formation have sidetracked grain, a contention railroads dismiss.
For traders storing and moving grain, the premium to secure a "shuttle train" has risen from zero to $2,000-$3,000 per car per year, an executive at an international grain trading house said.
Somebody's going to pay the cost.
"You're either going to get it from the farmer or from your customer," the executive said.
This year North Dakota's soyabean harvest is projected to expand more than a third, while its spring wheat crop will be 16 per cent bigger, the US Department of Agriculture estimates.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, said: "Normally we try to start the harvest caught up, in terms of having available storage cleaned out and farmers" grain sold and moved.
But we're starting from behind this year because of the service disruptions that occurred last year.
BNSF has reassured customers and regulators it should handle this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, BNSF's vice-president for agriculture, said the company had reduced its backlog of overdue movements - orders from customers for railcars that have taken more than four days to fulfil - from a peak of 16,500 in early April to 2,000.
"We've moved almost all the old crop that wanted to move with us," Mr Miller said, referring to grain left over from the previous harvest.
The most recent reported speeds for BNSF's grain trains, however, were still 9 per cent down on last year's second quarter - an indication of congestion.
Mr Miller accepted that progress had been "uneven" but pointed out that the company was in the course of making $5bn capital investments this year to increase capacity to handle surging traffic of all kinds, including grain.
Train speeds on Canadian Pacific, the other railroad suffering serious problems because of the backlog, are down 11 per cent on the same period last year but sharply up on far lower speeds earlier in the year.
CP has told the Surface Transportation Board, the railroad regulator, that changes in its ordering system for railcars should boost its ability to handle traffic in the coming harvest by 15 to 20 per cent.
"CP's operating plan going into the fall is focused on ongoing improvement in the velocity of our trains and effective utilisation of our railcar fleet in order to deliver more cars each week," said a spokeswoman.
Ukraine crisis may solve NATO's 'identity crisis'
World leaders, diplomats and experts have often fretted about the future of NATO and whether the end of its mission in Afghanistan would also be the end of its relevance.
But as 60 leaders, including President Obama, converge on Cardiff, Wales, this week for a NATO summit, the uncertainty seems more than a little premature.
The politicians and diplomats have no shortage of world crises crowding their agenda, so many that the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, once a top priority, has slipped down the list of most pressing.
Instead, the 28-nation alliance is being called upon to counter Russia's renewed incursion in Ukraine, a jolting reminder that threats to sovereignty in Europe are not necessarily a thing of the past.
While the leaders will be looking for new ways to punish Russia, they'll also be repositioning troops, pledging more money for military spending and recommitting to collective defense.
In some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin.
"It was really searching for its purpose ... and it was having a fairly significant identity crisis," said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
And it has now not only been repurposed, it's been reinvigorated.
Obama has also added another task to the agenda.
The president says he will try to corral leaders to work toward a strategy to defeat the rapidly rising Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
The president faces considerable challenges in rallying his war-weary allies to sign on to a military response, particularly one that crosses the border from Iraq into Syria, officials acknowledge.
But the president, who inartfully declared "we have no strategy" for defeating the extremists, is under pressure to show he is leading the world toward finding one.
Western officials have set modest expectations for breakthroughs on either Ukraine or Islamic State discussions at the summit.
The chief punishment in the pipeline for what Ukraine labeled a Russian invasion is additional economic sanctions.
European Union officials took up the issue over the weekend, but put off a decision on any new penalties.
And U.S. officials noted that Obama's key targets for cooperation on Islamic State were not necessarily NATO members.
The lineup of concerns could not have been anticipated two years ago, when the last North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit was held in Chicago and dominated by talk of the Afghanistan drawdown.
A year before that, then-Pentagon chief Robert M. Gates used his last speech in office to describe the organization as on the verge of "collective military irrelevance."
U.S. officials persistently complained of other nations falling short of their funding targets.
NATO members agree to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, but only four countries - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States - met that benchmark last year.
But White House officials now say they sense a shift.
NATO members are expected to sign a pledge in Cardiff agreeing to increase spending in support of the collective defense agreement.
The details were still under discussion late last week, but the White House noted momentum behind the effort as member nations seemed to see the threats facing them in starker terms.
In light of the Russian intrusion in Ukraine, the treaty's "defense guarantees are more salient today, more urgent today than they've been at any time since the end of the Cold War," said Charles Kupchan, senior director for Europe at the National Security Council.
We are reasonably optimistic that we will get agreement among the 28 allies.
Obama will spend much of his trip reiterating that commitment to collective defense for the benefit of Russia's anxious neighbors.
The president will begin his three-day trip with a daylong stop in Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet with leaders of that country as well as of Latvia and Lithuania.
Estonia has seen a rotation of U.S. NATO troops on its soil since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula this year, and it's bound to get a steady stream of NATO troops under a new Readiness Action Plan set to be announced this week.
The plan aims to shorten the time for NATO forces to respond to aggression on the frontline states, officials say.
It will come with increased air policing and other visible signs of alliance protection.
The move comes with some risk for NATO, which abstained from putting permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe, a gesture of comity toward Russia.
Officials say the new plan does not technically breach that agreement, but it may only be a semantic difference, said one Western diplomat, who would not be named discussing the plans before the formal announcement.
The word likely to be used to describe the NATO presence is "persistent," the diplomat said, rather than "permanent."
Putin’s effective ”winter weapon” – will he use it on Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has an ace up his sleeve when it comes to Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Mr. Putin of providing arms to the insurgents and sending Russian troops to Ukraine’s territory.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions against Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine has tensed up, the West is planning to impose harder sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia holds a trump card: winter is on its way, and Ukraine’s main source for energy is Russia.
According to an American authority, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), Geysar Gurbanov, active at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
With winter coming to Ukraine in the next under four months, and the coal mines located in the eastern part of the country ravaged by conflict, Ukrainians will freeze in their homes as their gas supplies from Russia are depleted.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, will help Mr. Putin to win the war eventually, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas consumed in Ukraine came from Russia.
On July 16th, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom said that Ukraine's outstanding debt for gas supplies stood at 5.3 billion dollars (approximately 4 billion euros) as of August 1st.
According to the New York Times Mr. Putin commented the upcoming winter with the following words:
I think that nobody thinks of [winter] any more, except Russia, Mr. Putin said.
There are always ways of helping resolve the issue.
First, to immediately stop hostilities, and start restoring the necessary infrastructure.
To start replenishing reserves, the necessary repair operations must be conducted and the preparations for the cold season must be made.
According to Business Insider, Mr. Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a veiled threat.
If Ukraine's army won't back down against the separatists, then Moscow might use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman of Japanese holding company Nomura noted last month that Russia's arguments for humanitarian intervention and the potential for engineering a fresh natural gas crisis in Ukraine will become stronger in a few months, if Russia can sustain the separatist militias' operations until then.
A note from Moscow has already arrived, saying that Ukraine must prepay for future gas shipments, unless Kiev begins payments on accumulated debts.
The EU is currently trying to negotiate a deal that would allow gas shipments to resume temporarily.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said last week that Russia is planning to suspend the gas shipments to the EU countries in the winter.
Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak said later that the rumours are unfounded.
He says Russia is doing every possible thing, so that gas can be supplied to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger sentenced to 10 years in prison and thousand lashes
A Saudi court has confirmed the 10 year jail sentence given in May to Raif Badawi, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement.
The sentence includes thousand lashes and a fine of one million riyals (approximately 200,000 euros) as an additional penalty.
The rationale of the judgement was that he had set up a website which insults Islam.
Suad al-Shamari, the other founder of the organization, told AFP about the sentence on Monday.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes already in July 2013, but the sentence was appealed, and it was returned to court for a new hearing.
An appeal against the sentence was presented also in May, when also Amnesty International noted about its unfairness.
A childhood experience of Riku Rantala of ”Madventures” in Afghanistan: ”It was a truly changing human encounter”
Madventures released today a new book called "Global Explanation – the Adventurer’s Explanation to Everything”.
We asked Riku Rantala an explanation for example for the future of the world and for the differences between Indian and Finnish cultures.
Riku also tells about the most significant human encounter of his life.
Riku Rantala, an author, a journalist, the other half of Madventures, is a busy man.
A new book has been released today, there was a film picnic at the Kansalaistori yesterday, and the second season of “Docventures” starts on Yle on Wednesday.
He has been running from one place to another since the morning.
After MTV morning show taking his child to the nursery school, and from there heading to a weekly meeting.
This interview was supposed to be made face-to-face, but it had to be changed into a telephone interview.
Otherwise there’s no time.
Amidst all the rush he and Tunna Milonoff, the other half of Madventures, have had time to stop and write the book ”Global explanation” which, according to the cover text, is an adventurer’s handbook to everything.
To everything, right?
Wow, that’s a lot to promise.
The book reflects on several themes, such as what is our future like, why a certain culture succeeds less than another, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of the interviews we had done over the years.
In the book, there are both professors and artists as experts.
We were working on the book actively for about a year, Riku tells over the phone to IS.
You have bit quite a big chunk to chew in the book.
What’s the key message of the book?
The message is that you must know more about the world, and that the big questions are worth contemplating, because that’s the best way for us to make it in this world.
On the other hand, the idea of the book is to be a good travel read, but it is meant to also make people discuss and share their thoughts at home as well.
The discussion can even lead to actions, Riku tells.

One of the book’s topics is the future of the world.
How does it look like?
We made a conclusion that the human race is optimistic.
Despite the climate warming and Earth’s present condition, you have to believe that at some point we will make solutions in order to improve our situation.
The Earth is like an alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, the change can take place only after that, Riku philosophises.
Riku tells that according to some studies the western humanity has reached the climax of the happiness in 1970s.
After that getting wealthier hasn’t increased our happiness.
From this we can deduce that when you have enough money and our basic needs are met, we’re happy.
Money doesn’t increase happiness.
In fact we want to instigate people to discuss about what is enough.
Exploitation of our natural resources doesn’t suffice for long if things continue like this, Riku notes.
You also discuss cultural differences in the book.
How an Indian person differs from a Finnish one?
People aren’t particularly different.
Of course, the starting points are different when it comes to education, health care and hygiene, for example.
Culturally the biggest difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India, in a good and a bad sense.
When the West has gotten wealthier, more people are living alone.
You isolate yourself from others, and that may lead to loneliness and distress.
If we could find the right balance between community and being alone, we would be quite close to happiness, Riku tells.
Riku has met lots of different people around the world.
Which human encounter has left the biggest imprint in his mind?
It happened when I was a child, when I was on my first longer trip abroad with my family.
We lived one year in India and in Pakistan, as my father was working there for the UN.
I was 7 years old, and my two younger siblings were there too.
My brother was just a baby, Riku describes.
We returned home carried by a big moving truck.
We were driving in Afghanistan, which was ravaged by war, and on the sides of the road there was a vast amount of refugees.
A girl of my age was walking on the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on the seat of a big Mercedes with a can of Coke in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
Also a child of that age gets the situation.
It was one truly changing human encounter, which I will remember always.

Riku and Tunna at a book fair in 2013.
At that moment Riku ”twigged” that other people must be respected, even if they were significantly poorer, or even if they hadn’t the same preconditions in life as we do.
Riku grasped already at that time that money can’t be the measure of the value of a human being.
Among the adulthood memories, the people he has met in New Guinea stand out.
I couldn’t stop marvelling how traditionally people live there.
They avail themselves of the natural materials in everything, they barely use money or metallic tools.
They live in very challenging conditions.
Surviving is really hard.
It made me think.
And along the book he and Tunna want to make the people think as well.
We want the book to inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would make people act, from warm lovemaking to a discussion, and even to a fist fight, Riku shoots.
The incident is being reported by the newspaper Kauhajoki.
The events started when the couple arrived at bus station, after which they called a taxi.
When the taxi started moving, a man who had been at the yard threw an object after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as well as the male passenger.
The man who had thrown the object stabbed the male passenger in the head, causing a life threatening wound, as well as on the hand, after which he left the scene.
The stabber is a corpulent, 170-175 cm tall man with short hair.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blond woman with a ponytail near the place where the event occurred.
The police wish she would contact them.
The police are also asking information from all those people who possibly have made observations of the events or of the related persons.
The stabbing took place on Wednesday, Aug 27th, around 7.50 pm.
”Hi!” said a brain to another brain – the world’s first ”telepathic” message travelled through the internet
The scientific publication PLOS ONE has published an article saying an international group of scientists has first succeeded in transmitting a message directly from one mind to another.
The first messages sent through the system were ”hola” and ”ciao”, that is ”hi” respectively in Spanish and in Italian.
In the trial setting, the emitter subject’s electroencephalographic was observed.
The emitter was trained with the program to send bits by thinking of the movement of a hand or a foot.
The imagining of the movement of the foot was coded as value 0 and moving the hands as value 1.
This data, which had been encoded in bits, was sent through the internet to the receiver subject.
A perception of a light flash was induced in the receiver with a magnetic stimulation per every coded bit value 1.
The receiver had been instructed to code the flashes as messages.
The scientist admit that this field of study is still in its infancy, but that they believe the computer aided telepathic communication will be routine activity in the not-so-distant future of the humanity.
Sanctions - Punkti - Maaseudun Tulevaisuus
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
Also the United States is tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for the sanctions.
It would be impossible that the EU and the US wouldn’t react, when Russia makes war in Ukraine and has invaded Crimea.
In international politics, an act is followed by a reaction, and actions are followed by counteractions.
Experience shows that all sanctions only have an effect in the long run.
Iran was persuaded to talks with regards to its nuclear program after years only.
The apartheid government of South-Africa sat glued to its chairs, even when trade was banned with UN resolutions.
Sanctions have been used against Russia, too.
During the Cold War, exporting high-end electronics or military technology to the Soviet Union wasn’t allowed.
Russia itself has set obstacles for trade for ages.
The latest was when trade of raw timber was being frozen by timber duties.
It is clear that you can’t get Russia on its knees with sanctions.
The Russians are accustomed to bad times, and Viola disappearing from the shops doesn’t create panic.
When the EU says it’s going to ban importing vodka from Russia, it’s basically a joke.
The Russians will be glad to drink that vodka themselves.
The EU sanctions are also selective.
The French can export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland can’t export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest damage to Russia is not the petering out of the cheese import or the vodka export.
The biggest damage is caused by the restriction of the financial sector.
They’ll have an impact in the future only.
The Russian state will not be able to operate in the international lending markets.
It has to make payments of the old loans, but obtaining new ones is difficult.
Even though Russia has enormous foreign exchange reserves, they won’t last forever either.
The Russian businesses’ access to credit will wane, and money becomes more expensive.
Their own banks will not be able to finance all of them.
More money needs to be printed, or the businesses will have payment difficulties.
The bankruptcies are bankruptcies in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis will continue for years, Russia’s modernisation will halt, as Renée Nyberg, a Russia specialist, wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn’t be the first time.
Little by little Russia would become Russia again, and it would become inward-looking.
An exceptional freestyle wrestling event organised in North Korea
Approximately 10,000 North-Koreans and a group of diplomats were attending the international freestyle wrestling games organised in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
The event was organised by Japanese Antonio Inoki, a freestyle wrestler who used to be a lawyer. The participants came from Japan, United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the freestyle wrestling matches, also taekwondo matches by local athletes’ were seen.
According to Mr. Inoki, the goal of the event was to bring belligerent countries closer to each other and promote world peace through the sport.
The politics wished for improvement in the relations between North Korea and Japan in their speeches.
During the summer, Japan lifted some of the sanctions it had imposed against North Korea as a consequence of the kidnapping of Japanese persons in 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea promised to reopen the investigation of the case.
International freestyle wrestling was seen in North Korea last time in 1995.
SOK will reduce approximately 110 persons working in its consumable goods trade organisation.
The co-determination started in June, and at that time the reduction need was estimated to be up to 130 persons.
According to the company, overlapping activities have been dismantled, and the areas of responsibilities have been made clearer within the organisation.
SOK tells the actions are aimed to clearly improve the cost efficiency and the synergy between different domains.
Behind these actions is, besides the economic recession and the decline in consumer demand, also the structural change in trading, which has shaken especially the consumables goods trade.
The consumables goods trade of the S Group has been making a loss for some time.
The co-determination concerned all workers in consumables goods trade and grocery retailing, as well as the management, i.e. approximately 530 workers in total.
Turun Sanomat: part of the non-prescription medicines behind the counter
The newspaper says that between the prescription medicines and those you can pick yourself from the shelves there will be more medicines that customers can get without prescription, but only after a consultancy with the pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Pharmacists’ Association, for example the eye drops containing antibiotics could be included in the consultancy service.
After an interview with a pharmacist or a dispensing chemist, and if the pre-determined criteria are met, the medicine could be delivered over the counter, says Kirsi Kvanström, chairman of the Pharmacists’ Association in Turun Sanomat.
In Finland, there already are some medicines which are available without a prescription, but require consultancy.
One of these is the emergency contraception preparation.
Corruption under keener scrutiny
Finland will pay increasingly attention to corruption prevention.
It has been recommended by both OECD and the European Commission, as outside Finland the small amount of country’s bribing cases and sentences arouses amazement.
By the end of the year, the work group of the Ministry of Justice will discuss whether the criminal law would need sections for influence trading and abuse.
The differences between legislations emerged for example in the court hearing of the Slovenian branch of the Patria bribing case in Hämeenlinna one year ago.
Trading of influence led in Slovania to a two year prison sentence for the former prime minister, but the Finnish law doesn’t acknowledge such offence.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has tighten its cooperation in accordance with the requirements of the government program.
According to a recently completed mapping, the bribing is barely investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered from University of Vaasa and The Police University College a report on propensity to corruption on different fields.

Wanderers coach Tony Popovic has faith in replacements for Asian Champions League clash in Korea
Tony Popovic will be without three key players in Korea.
WITH several key members of his squad suspended for the first leg, Western Sydney Wanderers coach Tony Popovic says he won't be afraid to throw any of his players into the Asian Champions League cauldron at FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai for a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly games in Abu Dhabi, to prepare for their semi-final first leg on September 17.
Due to an accumulation of yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole will all miss the trip to Korea, but Wanderers coach Popovic has faith in their replacements.
"Of course it is a loss - they've been three very important players in the ACL for us," Popovic said.
Tomi Juric got banned for this gesture in China.
It's a blow, you don't want to miss any of your players, but we missed Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game and up until now we've had Daniel Mullen injured.
Whoever comes in has done a great job and I've got full faith in the whole squad.
I won't be afraid to play anyone in that semi-final.
The Wanderers will also be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The Socceroos defender picked up the injury during pre-season but has resumed running and is a chance of playing in the return leg at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"It's on track, so he's progressing well," Popovic said.
He has his own program that he's filling and will be coming with us to Dubai, which is great news for him that he's starting to slowly get out on the field.
He's had a couple of sessions outside, which is good.
It's still a while away for us before he's fully fit, but he's progressing well.
While the Wanderers are in Dubai they will be making use of the world-class facilities on offer at the exclusive Al Sheba Sports Complex.
But Popovic says the trip is also an opportunity for his squad, which has changed significantly since the end of last season, to get to know each other better.
"We know that this will certainly help the players bond together as well," Popovic said.
We've got a lot of new players and it will be a great opportunity for them to get know each other even better on and off the field.
So we'll use that camp for various reasons.
Elite’s hamburger costs three times worker’s monthly wage
Sep 01, 2014, 9:18 pm In North Korea, the luxury of the rich households can be enjoyed, if you happen to belong to country’s elite.
Financial Times tells about the economy torn by contrasts.
The informal markets thrive in North Korea, perhaps more than ever before.
They offer to the wealthy, or to the thrifty ordinary citizens luxury, which usually isn’t connected to a dictatorial regime.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: only the entry fee to this recreation park is up to ten times as much as an ordinary worker’s monthly wage.
At the park you can eat hamburgers which cost 76 dollars.
That’s a 3-5 months wage for an ordinary working man in the country.
Men are drinking beer in shorts at the pool.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea’s ”western markets” have their origin in the 1990s, when the country was suffering famine.
The government permits their existence, even though the prices of the goods may be outrageous at worst.
And yet, many in Pyongyang have a mobile phone which RRP is 200 dollars.
The leader Kim Jong-un, 31, may be partially to blame, as he has been trying to deliver an energetic and youthful image of himself.
During his time the government has stressed the importance of the technology in country’s development.

Ormiston House: Stormont Assembly hopeful of sale
The Stormont Assembly is hopeful it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that was costing the taxpayer almost £3,000 a week.
The assembly bought the 19th Century property in the east of the city 13 years ago for £9m.
While it remained unsold, it cost the assembly an estimated £400 a day on security and maintenance.
It was recently advertised at £1.25m.
It is understood the property will be used as a private residence.
The Grade B listed building was bought for £9m in 2001 to provide extra office accommodation for the assembly.
But it was later deemed unfit for that purpose.
Ten years after it was bought, the property was put on the market with an asking price of £2.5m.
It was not sold and the price was dropped.
Last year, the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt suggested Ormiston House might provide a venue for a new international trauma centre.
But now the assembly has confirmed it is working to agree the sale of the property.
A spokesperson said a new owner would take possession of the site when legal work was concluded.
Neither the assembly nor the estate agent involved would comment on the identity of the buyer or the purchase price.
The average weekly bill for security and repairs at Ormiston House is around £3,000.
The assembly bought the property from the Police Authority, the predecessor of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
At the start of this year, security costs at Ormiston had come to £885,641, while maintenance and running costs added up to £371,379.
Professional fees relating to repairs and maintenance added another £250,015 to the total bill, while a further £212,466 was spent on professional fees for development and planning.
The property was previously owned by the shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland who remained there until 1887, when it was acquired by his business partner William Pirrie, who later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff came into sole ownership of the property, selling it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-1970s.
”Inequality is increasing”: Helsinki to reduce education assistants
Savings aren’t being created, claims the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors JHL.
Helsinki is preparing a radical reduction in the amount of school specific education assistants.
The reduction wouldn’t concern children’s personal assistants.
The Education and Training Committee of Helsinki ended up proposing a cut of approximately 2.7 million in total to the resources of education assistants.
There are approximately 600 education assistants in total in Helsinki.
If the reductions will take place, they will be come into effect in the middle of the term, starting from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL the decision will increase inequality.
There are more and more children in need of support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately very easy to reduce assistants for saving reasons, because it hasn’t been defined clearly in the legislation how much support should be given.
There surely will not be any saving. On the contrary, the burden of the teaching personnel will increase.
For the pupils it produces a greater risk to miss the learning goals, and also the teachers’ strength will be tried, stresses Päivi Niemi-Laine, the domain director of JHL.
The plans of the city of Helsinki will produce inequality to schools, because with the future resources, small schools and the pupils in need of support will not get any assistant resources any more.
The goal of the city of Helsinki is inequality prevention.
It is exactly the educational assistants, who currently are doing the preventive work with results.
However, the adaptive measures of the Education Department target mainly this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final resolution regarding the resources will be made in the autumn by the City Council of Helsinki, to whom I wish insight and wisdom in looking far in the future and in acting up to its goals, Niemi-Laine says.
Israel claims land in West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement known as "Gevaot," in the Etzion settlement bloc, near Bethlehem.
Israel laid claim on Sunday to nearly 400 hectares (1000 acres) of West Bank land in a Jewish settlement bloc near Bethlehem - a step that could herald significant Israeli construction in the area - defying Palestinian demands for a halt in settlement expansion and challenging world opinion.
Peace Now, an Israeli group that opposes the construction of settlements in the West Bank, said that the action on Sunday might be the largest single appropriation of West Bank land in decades and that it could "dramatically change the reality" in the area.
Palestinians aspire to form a state in the lands that Israel conquered in 1967.
Israeli officials said the political directive to expedite a survey of the status of the land came after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in June while hitchhiking in that area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the prime mover in the kidnapping and killing of the teenagers.
The timing of the land appropriation suggested that it was meant as a kind of compensation for the settlers and punishment for the Palestinians.
The land, which is near the Jewish settlement of Gvaot in the Etzion bloc south of Jerusalem, has now officially been declared "state land," as opposed to land privately owned by Palestinians, clearing the way for the potential approval of Israeli building plans there.
But the mayor of the nearby Palestinian town of Surif, Ahmad Lafi, said the land belonged to Palestinian families.
He told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA that Israeli army forces and personnel posted orders early on Sunday announcing the seizure of land that was planted with olive and forest trees in Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba'a and Wadi Fukin.
Interested parties have 45 days in which to register objections.
The kidnapping of the teenagers prompted an Israeli military clampdown in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamic group that dominates Gaza and that Israel said was behind the abductions.
The subsequent tensions along the Israel-Gaza border erupted into a 50-day war that ended last week with an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire.
The land appropriation has quickly turned attention back to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and exposed the contradictory visions in the Israeli government that hamper the prospects of any broader Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Lapland’s crisis municipalities usually multi-problematic
Increasingly greater part of Lapland’s municipalities has problems, as emerges from a wellbeing research made by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to crisis municipalities’ problems.
Professor says reducing municipalities’ tasks by one billion euros isn’t enough.
Common elements among the crisis municipalities are for example weak municipality economy, weak employment and relocation losses.
Asko Suikkanen, professor emeritus of sociology in the University of Lapland, says there are new crisis municipalities coming from the western border and eastern Lapland.
In the survey part of the research, the inhabitants were assessing the situation of their municipality in a quite realistic way.
The inhabitants of the municipalities which did well in the research even had a pessimistic view of the prospects.
Unenthusiastic expectations affect the consumption.
People wish that the current everyday life and wellbeing would continue and that they maybe would even improve.
In these times people are afraid to make long time investments, such as buying a house, says Suikkanen.
The research group was surprised by the big differences between the municipalities.
For example, the income support expenses per inhabitant range from something like twenty euros to well over hundred euros.
The tax revenue gained by the municipality per inhabitant range from a good two thousand euros of Ranua to Pelkosenniemi’s 4,400 euros.
According to Suikkanen the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How the money is spent, how much state subsidies are being received and what is the level of the indebtedness, differ a lot between municipalities which are in similar situations, he says.

UK may close the borders from the Islamist fighters returning home
Great Britain may temporarily prevent the Islamist fighters, who have gone to Iraq and Syria, from returning home.
The news is reported by BBC, who refers to governmental sources.
However, according to the BBC, the suspected British citizens would be allowed to keep their citizenships.
A governmental source says this is one of the many proposals to be considered.
The proposal is currently being finished, and Prime Minister David Cameron is supposed to present it.
The government is also seeking for means with which it could make possible fighters’ travelling abroad more difficult.
One measure might be an extension to the authorities’ powers so, that they might temporarily seize passports of the possible fighters at the border.
UK raised the possibility of a terror threat to the second highest level on Friday.
Bob Carr welcomes the imminent release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from a Libyan jail
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan jail today.
The federal government has welcomed news Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor later today.
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Bob Carr said "all going well" the International Criminal Court lawyer will be released into the custody of Australian officials tonight and will board a plane bound for Europe by midnight.
"We welcome the news that she is likely to be released today," the spokesman told AAP from New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for their help and support, the spokesman said.
Ms Taylor is likely to be taken to Rome before her onward journey to her home in The Hague.
Ms Taylor, along with three of her ICC colleagues, was detained in the Libyan city of Zintan on June 7 while representing Seif al-Islam, the son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
Libyan officials said she was found carrying documents for Seif that were judged a threat to national security.
Senator Carr has lobbied hard for her release, even visiting the Libyan capital Tripoli last month to press her case.
Ms Taylor was not able to speak to her husband and young daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Ms Taylor was permitted to call her home in The Hague shortly after a visit by Australia's ambassador David Ritchie.
Mr Carr subsequently spoke to Ms Taylor's Brisbane-based parents John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear she was finally allowed a phone call.
Her parents had pleaded with Libya to release their daughter in time for her toddler's third birthday in July.
The three other detained ICC staffers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Mr Carr said a week ago that talks in The Hague between the ICC and the Libyan authorities had resulted in "the ICC expressing regret, effectively an apology for any misunderstandings."
The ICC has stopped short of admitting to any wrongdoing but has said it will fully investigate its team's behaviour upon their return.
"When the ICC has completed its investigation, the Court will ensure that anyone found responsible for any misconduct will be subject to appropriate sanctions," it added in a statement issued last month.
The ICC wants to try Seif al-Islam, 39, for crimes against humanity during his father's rule, which came to an abrupt end last year.
Tripoli insists he should be tried locally and filed on May 1 a motion challenging the ICC's jurisdiction to put him on trial in The Hague.
Young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second win at the early stage of Spain’s football league, but it wasn’t easy to defeat Villarreal on its home field.
The blue-reds butted their heads against Villarreal’s goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo, until they finally succeeded on the 82th minute.
The winning goal was made by a surprising man: 19 year old striker Sandro Ramirez, who had been doing his first performance in La Liga, had entered the field only 12 minutes earlier.
The young man, who had been invited to the representative crew from Barcelona’s secondary team, finished from a close range when Asenjo had stopped Lionel Messi’s attempt.
After reaching $433,000, donations for Ferguson cop halt mysteriously
After raising more than $400,000 for the police officer who killed an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., two online donation pages appear to have been shut down by their organizers without explanation this weekend.
On the crowdsourced fundraising site GoFundMe, "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" -- two separate pages with similar names -- have raised $235,750 and $197,620, respectively, for the Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar page for Brown's family, run by the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, had raised $314,099 as of Sunday afternoon.
The shooting triggered weeks of unrest and demonstrations against the overwhelmingly white police force in mostly black Ferguson, sending Wilson into hiding as local and federal investigations seek to determine whether he wrongfully killed Brown.
The online donation campaigns have generated some controversy for defending Wilson, especially after some visitors left racially offensive remarks in at least one of the comment sections, which have since been removed.
Both pages appear to have stopped taking donations around the same time on Saturday, and the pages' organizers did not explain why.
If a visitor attempts to donate, a message appears that says: "Donations are Complete!
The organizer has stopped donations.
In a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, a spokeswoman for GoFundMe said the website had not halted the donations.
"Each and every GoFundMe campaign organizer is able to decide for themselves when they would like to stop accepting donations," said the statement from GoFundMe spokeswoman Kelsea Little.
Organizers may also choose to begin accepting donations again at a later date.
The page "Support Officer Wilson," which raised $197,620, is run by a St. Louis police charity called "Shield of Hope," which has been certified by GoFundMe as a valid donation recipient.
The three officers listed on Shield of Hope's state nonprofit records, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, did not immediately respond to emails Sunday seeking more information about the fundraising efforts.
Zoll is a public information officer for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a city council member for nearby Florissant, and Roorda a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.
Nor was The Times able to immediately reach the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, a user called "Stand Up," who has raised $235,750 and who has not been officially certified as a verified recipient on the donation page.
GoFundMe's spokeswoman vouched for the anonymous donor in a statement to The Times, however.
In contrast to the other Wilson page and the donation page for Brown, little information has been given to donors about who is running the anonymous fundraising effort.
In a message to visitors two weeks ago, the anonymous Wilson fundraiser page wrote that it was working with Shield of Hope to become a verified recipient.
That has not happened.
The fundraiser also gave out a pseudonymous Gmail account to users seeking more information, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
In its statement to The Times, GoFundMe's spokeswoman said the anonymously run donation page had also been removed from its search results, adding that "this campaign no longer meets GoFundMe's stated requirement of having a valid Facebook account connected."
GoFundMe's security policies encourage users to "only contribute payments to GoFundMe users they personally know and trust.
Unfortunately there is no way to 100% guarantee that a user's GoFundMe donation page contains accurate or truthful information.
But spokeswoman Little said GoFundMe "has been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to question their authenticity.
Finally, GoFundMe does possess the ability to place a hold on all donations raised by any campaign that warrants further investigation.
Nevertheless, she said GoFundMe did not place the hold.
A popular Facebook page that has been organizing pro-Wilson efforts, called "Support Officer Wilson," told followers this weekend that lawyers were working on a "solution" as to why the GoFundMe fundraisers had been shut down, but gave no more information.
The Facebook page is also run anonymously, and those remarks could not be independently verified.
Arsenal’s top striker out for the rest of the year - Premier League - Ilta-sanomat
English Premier League Arsenal’s French striker Olivier Giroud is probably out of the games until the end of the year.
Giroud’s ankle was operated on Wednesday, and the recovery will take months.
Giroud hurt his leg in a Premier League match against Everton in the weekend.
The operation went well, but he’s out until he will be able to play on the top level, through the end of December or the beginning of January, said Arsene Wenger, Arsenal’s head coach, to Sky Sports.
With his 16 hits, Giroud was Arsenal’s best scorer in the last season, so the loss is tangible.
However, Wenger says he won’t necessarily get anyone to replace Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger had a fresh acquisition, Alexis Sanchez, play in the up front on Wednesday in the Champions League final qualifying match against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 with Sanchez’s goal.
Nude pictures of Hollywood celebrities are circulating the web - hacking suspected
Images, which were allegedly nude photos of several public personalities, were circulating social media on Sunday.
In the pictures there were for example Oscar winning actress Jennifer Lawrence and pop star Rihanna.
According to a US media source, the photos are suspected to have ended up as target of a wide hacking case.
The media source says the photos would have been stolen from Apple’s iCloud accounts.
“It's so weird and hard how people take your privacy away from you,” Lawrence tweeted.
According to the media source, in the photos there were also for example actress and model Jenny McCarthy, reality TV performer Kim Kardashian, as well as singer and actress Avril Lavigne.
Singer and pop star Ariana Grande’s publicist says the photos in which she allegedly is, are fake.
Singer Victoria Justice said the same.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who has been acting in horror films, said the intimate photos of her are years old.

Thousand Finnish persons replied to Tietoykkönen’s survey in August.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and the screenwriter of the series “The Bridge” will do a crime series together
Jens Lapidus, one of the Sweden’s most famous crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, the screenwriter who has been doing the popular series “The Bridge”, are preparing a new TV series together.
The shooting of the series “Advokaten”, which will have 10 episodes, is going to start next year.
Swedish production company Tre Vänner told about the project in a statement on Monday.
The series has been purchased by Sweden’s TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
“Advokaten” is set up in Stockholm, and it tells about a young lawyer called Frank who, working on a case, finds grim connections between his own family and notorious crime organisations.
Crime writer Lapidus’s, who rose to fame with his novel “Easy Money”, main profession is defence lawyer.
