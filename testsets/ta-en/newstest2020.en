The police department has arrested only a few people in connection with this incident.
The business community, various political parties, activists and citizens have heavily condemned this incident. A protest condemning this incident was announced on 9th of last month by the Secular Progressive alliance of Tirupur.
With the permission denied, a complaint was given to the District Collector and Tirupur District Police commissioner.
In a discussion that followed, a protest was announced by the Secular Progressive alliance again on September 17.
Since the police department denied permission for this also, a protest “Condemning the violent approach of Hindu Munnani and urging speedy action from the police” was conducted defying the ban.

Condemning this event, we have asked for proper permission to conduct a protest democratically, but the police department denied it. Regarding this, we made a complaint to the Collector, and Police Commissioner. The police denied us permission, considering the importance of the demands we are conducting, to protest democratically in a non-violent way defying the ban.
Also the police department has arrested only a few people in connection with the attack on the knitwear company.
They urged the police to take speedy action to arrest Hindu Munnani agitators in connection with this incident.
Since more than 500 people particularly women, participated together in the agitation, and raised their voice against violence, the police retreated without arresting those who defied the ban.
In the agitation, voices were raised against the attack on the knitwear company by Hindu Munnai and against various forms of communal violence unleashed by Hindu Munnani.
That the protest was conducted democratically, and with control by the Secular Progressive Alliance, creating awareness against violence among the people of Tirupur, is not an overstatement!

With so many people complaining about this, it does not seem that they thought of an alternative way, or realised that the solution lies with them.
The proper solution to this is, only if I do what I believe, people will be ready to follow.
So my wife and I walk 10 kms once a week to purchase vegetables.
Since this has continued for six months, we are now used to it.
"Now I am mentally very satisfied” he says.
“Many said that it would be tough to walk, carrying large amounts of vegetables. I recommended them to carry a bamboo basket with them to fight against the plastic threat."
But they laughed at this.
So my wife and I went to the market carrying a bamboo basket.
Only then did I realise that it would be helpful in many ways.
Many youths are not physically healthy nowadays.
I think they should start walking and control their diet.
I deeply believe that only traditional methods can provide the best solutions for new challenges that are brought up by the modern world.
If a person follows traditional methods, he could be “fully fit” says an excited Ram Singh IAS.

The disqualification period of the Sikkim Chief Minister Premsingh who was convicted in corruption case has been reduced to one month from six years.
So the stalemate has been removed for Damang to contest in the by-election.
Sikkim assembly elections were held along with Loksabha elections.
Sikkim Granthikari Morcha registered an overwhelming victory in this election.
The leader of that party Premsingh Damang took charge as the Chief Minister of the state.
But Damang was sentenced to prison in 2016 by a lower court in a corruption case.
Since this was confirmed by the Supreme Court also, he was imprisoned.
Since a person sentenced to prison in a corruption case cannot contest in elections for 6 years, there was a controversy even while he assumed office.
In this scenario Damang is contesting in the Sikkim by-election.
Damang is ruling in Sikkim with the support of BJP.
Meanwhile, Damang has sent a letter to the Election commission requesting to remove the 6 year ban imposed on him to contest in elections, quoting various sections of law.
The election commission has announced that it has reduced the ban period to one year and a month, after considering his letter.
Thus there is no ban for Damang to contest in the Assembly by-election.
Using the concession given to Damang the BJP may start its political game in other states including Tamilnadu.
Statements may also be released from Election commission fulfilling the wishes of the BJP in entirety.

There were revolutionary movements before and after Bagat Singh.
But it is not just an appreciation that Bagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to revolutionary movements and through that to Indian politics.
Today we can sense a feeling among people that revolutionists are blindfolded and don’t care for the lives of the people.
The period of Bagat Singh shows us their humanity and clear thoughts and capacity.
The name of Bagat Singh became popular in India after the incident of bombing assembly in April 1929.
But in Tamilnadu he became popular among the public after some time in 1930.
But within a year of introduction his fame spread so quickly even in the nook and corners of Tamilnadu.
This is something amazing in history, none of the North Indian born leaders including Gandhi gained fame in a very short time in Tamilnadu.
Periyar is the reason behind this.
An editorial titled Bagat Singh was published in Kudiyarasu weekly just after a week of killing of Bagat Singh.
The editorial appreciated many characters of Bagat Sngh and also put forth few ideas about the political situation during that period.
Excerpts of that editorial:-
“If Bagat Singh was determined that his objectives and the path chosen by him to achieve them is correct, we are sure that he was supposed to act accordingly and if he had not acted so, then we can not call him as a great personality.
So we can now call him as a real man.
It is our strong opinion that India is really in need of the policies of Bagat Singh.
Bagat Singh would not have gained such fame if he was not executed.
Also we would further say that if Bagat Singh had not been executed that would have aided the principles of Gandhi further.
Bagat Singh, who would have burnt to ashes after dying due to a disease uselessly got a chance to die usefully showing a path of real equality and peace not only to the people of India but also to the people of the whole world.
We appreciate Bagat Singh generously that this immortality not easily endowed on everyone.
Thus Periyar has mentioned in the editorial of the Magazine Kudiyarasu.

In this scenario, without giving any importance to Government education institutions in the new education policy, it has introduced various rules making the education institutions to function using the fund provided by private institutions.
Through these steps it is involved in making only rich people be able to get education from primary level to higher education and making India an illiterate country in the future taking India back to many centuries.

The chief guest of the event Karpura Sundarapandiyan in his speech said:-
Late cartoonist Ranu alias Ramanujam was a legend among cartoonists.
Ranu has created many students through Cartoon research and the education foundation.
Generally, a person who is celebrated throughout the world may not be a celebrity in his own family.
In contrary, it is a proud thing that the family of Ranu has released his book after his death.
Though Ranu is dead, he will live for a long time through his creations and through this book.
In his speech, Keezhambur Sankara Subramaniam said, S.K.Ramanujam was a leading cartoonist in India.
He travelled throughout the world and trained students in drawing cartoons.
He was an innovative artist in creating cartoons.
Ranu was not only an expert at drawing but also with cartoons and in the field of animation.
He researched the art of cartoon, according to the Indian environment for the past 30 years.
He will live long through the students he has created and through his letters and cartoons.

How many check dams were constructed in the 8 year ADMK rule, DMK has questioned the Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy.
In a statement released by the party`s treasurer Duraimurugan regarding this, he has criticized that the Chief Minister is blabbering without any knowledge about the Public works department.
In his statement the DMK President Duraimurugan has stated, the water released in Cauvery is reaching the sea without uselessly due to the negligence and ineffective administration.
As a leader of the opponent party in the legislative assembly, our leader M.K.Stalin has voiced his concern with responsibility that the ADMK government has no proper plans to save the water of Cauvery on its way.
Edappadi Palanisamy, thinking of answering this question asked, “Has the DMK party, who is criticizing us, built at least one check dam during their rule?”
“What I want to tell him is, during the rule of our party we have constructed a check dam across Cauvery at Mayanur.
Can a Chief Minister, who has Public works department also with him, give wrong details without even knowing this detail.?
That check dam built in Mayanur has improved the ground water level in that area.
So Agriculture prospered.
So you can see that thousands of people belonging to farmer community from that area who are the beneficiaries even today are grateful to DMK forever.
The check dam was built in Mayanur according to the need that arisen during at that time.
There was no need to build more check dams then.
Had there been any need, the then Chief Minister would have given permission immediately, allotted money and initiated the works.
So Edappadi is in no way qualified to criticize the party in caring about Cauvery.
I am asking; during the past eight year ADMK rule, how many check dams have you built across Cauvery?
Another question; During DMK ruling periods, we have constructed more than 40 check dams in Tamilnadu.
Can you refer to at least one dam as built during the previous ADMK regimes?
Don’t lie.
If you have any answer to the accusation of the Opponent leader, show us with evidences about the places of construction or about the proposed plans.
Leaving all these details and putting forth an unreal accusation that no check dams were built across Cauvery during the DMK regime may be fine for Edappadi personally but neither good nor a civilized act for the post that is being held by him, and it is my duty to remind him about this, said Duraimurugan.

DMK leader M.K. Stalin today visited the Keezhadi excavation sites that revealed the Tamil culture in the banks of river Vaigai.
The results of the Keezhadi excavation revealed that the lifestyle told in ancient Tamil literature is the life of the real Tamils, and is not just fiction.
The urban civilisation in the banks of the river Ganges started during 6th century BC.
But the Tamils of the banks of the river Vaigai in the south were at the peak of urban civilisation during 6th century BC; Tamils led a wealthy life with very high literacy and knowledge, and this was scientifically proven by evidence from the excavation.
The results of the Keezhadi excavation have prompted a rewriting of the history of the Indian sub-continent.
The public is visiting the Keezhadi excavation sites, which is a symbol of pride to every Tamilian.
Recently, the chief coordinator of Naam Tamilar Katchi Seeman visited the Keezhadi excavation sites.
Following him, today the DMK leader, M.K.Stalin visited the Keezhadi excavation sites.
The CPM MP S.Venkatesan and many leading executives of DMK accompanied him.
In connection with this, Stalin has uploaded a video of his visit to his Twitter page under the title “While visiting the Keezhadi sites that reminded the world about the Tamil civilisation.”
Trump wants the Ukraine President to be investigated!
The White House has confirmed the information released about Donald Trump’s telephone request to conduct an investigation of the former Vice-President Joe Biden, a probable presidential candidate of the Democratic party.
An impeachment resolution is being proposed against Trump by Democrats in the House of Representatives, citing such an action to initiate an inquiry against an American leader by pressuring another country is wrong.
Regarding this, upon the order of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, 6 committees have been formed and an investigation is being initiated.
Trump contacted the Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky via phone on July 25. During that conversation Trump asked him to conduct an investigation.
Yesterday, the White House officially released a report regarding the conversation between the presidents of the two countries.
Hence it is accepted that such a conversation is true.
Meanwhile, during his interaction with the reporters after leaving a United Nations meeting, Trump said this was a friendly request.
There was no pressure on the Ukrainian President.
But one notable issue in this is the sudden stopping of aid worth around 400 million dollars that is being given to Ukraine by the American government.
That aid was later allocated.
The cadres of the Democratic Party see a connection between this and the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.
Hence, this incident is creating a storm in the American politics.
Hunter, the son of Joe Biden was appointed as a paid board member of Burisma Holdings of Ukraine in April, 2014.
It is notable that this company is involved in natural gas exploration activities in Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia.

The Republic party alleges that Joe Biden is behind this.
Despite this, Hunter Biden continues to deny this charge of using his family connection to further his own professional benefit.
A government official trying to attack a journalist in the presence of School Education Minister Sengottaiyan, has created a stir.

Historical evidence to establish the fame of Keezhadi was found out in the 5th phase of excavation, said Minister Pandiyarajan.
During his speech, after visiting in the presence of Jayakanthan, the minister of Khadi and village industries G.Baskaran, the Minister of Tamil official language and Tamil culture told the press:
The 5th phase of archaeological excavation is proving to be a turning point in the historical analysis of ancient Tamil Nadu.
The prosperity of Keezhadi dates from 6 BC to 1 AD.
The evidence obtained in this study now shows urbanisation in the banks of the river Vaigai.
The scientific estimation in the Keezhadi excavation has dated the Tamil-Brami back a further 100 years. This study has revealed that the Tamil society was a literate community in 6 BC.
Also the samples of 70 pieces of bone that were excavated in this study were sent for scientific analysis to Deccan College, the Masters and Research institution.
These pieces of bone on classification during analysis were identified as oxen, buffalo, goat, wild boar, antelope and peacock.
This study shows that animals such as cow, buffalo, and goat were used in agriculture, and the scars found in the bone samples of antelope, goat and wild boar shows that these animals were used for eating.
The results of this analysis show that the ancient community which was primarily engaged in agriculture, also engaged in livestock farming.
The samples of roofing made of brick and limestone, and the coating of sheath wells, were being sent for analysis to Velur Technical University.
During the study, minerals such as silica sand, limestone, iron, aluminium and magnesium were found in each of these.
Work is in progress to construct a museum in the prime location to preserve such rare findings and to make Keezhadi to be useful for Tamil scholars, students and the public.
Furthermore, the 5th phase of excavation will be extended for two more weeks, and the works will be continued.
Similarly, the state government will combine with the central government to carry out the 6th phase of archaeological excavation at four places during the next year, said the Minister for Tamil official language and Tamil culture.

A 17 year old girl from Rajasthan awarded with “Change maker” award by Bill Gates Foundation, for fighting against child marriage and child labor.
Payal Jankit (17) hails from Hinsla village, 100 Kms from Jaipur in Rajasthan district.

Is BJP indulging in caste politics to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu?
Being unable to make its Lotus blossom in Tamil Nadu after so many unsuccessful attempts, it is said that BJP is finally indulging in caste politics.
During the first tenure of Modi as Prime Minister, Lotus was in a position to be searched in Tamil Nadu.
Twice during the just-concluded MP election, Amit Shah said sternly “I won’t care about what you may do. Lotus must blossom in Tamil Nadu.”
But it lost in all 5 constituencies it had contested.
Although the whole nation supported BJP, there is still an anti-BJP wave in Tamil Nadu.
Triple talaq, the Kashmir problem, enforcing Hindi, and one nation one language problems were above all these.
All these problems have added to the woes of the party.
Hence it is said that BJP high command is very angry with the Tamil Nadu BJP executives, and there is a problem with even the state president not being nominated.
However, BJP is planning to gain a stronghold in Tamil Nadu at any cost, before the upcoming elections.
From direct field reports, it seems that the BJP high command has almost reached a decision.
Accordingly there is a thought among the people of Nadar, Vanniyar and Devendra kula velalar communities, that these people are not given required importance by both ADMK and DMK.
So they are upset with the Dravidian parties, it is said.
BJP has cleverly started playing this card.
It is said that it has decided to honour each community by granting a post.
The appointment of Tamilisai Soundararajan as the Telengana Governor is such a move.
Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is giving importance to nadars in higher posts in ISRO.
It is true that this action of BJP to honour each community will make the people of that community feel proud and happy.
Also, this caste politics will reward BJP with what it cannot achieve by other means.
At the same time, with Tamil Nadu already being spoiled by caste politics, it is not known if these activities of BJP will further fan the flames.
Incase the caste feelings are fanned further, BJP will lose even the smallest gains it has made so far!

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t say a single word regarding the Kashmir issue during his speech at the United Nations Assembly today
The 74th session of the United Nations Assembly is currently in progress.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on behalf of India today.
During his speech he called on the nations of the world to unite against terrorism.
During his speech he quoted lines of the Tamil poet Kaniyan Poonkundranar “The world is one, all are relations.”
Modi proudly said that the contribution of India in global warming is moving towards a solution, and said that India is contributing less to global warming and giving more solutions.
The government of India is taking serious initiatives to make India free of plastics.
He also said that a large scale health insurance plan is being implemented in India.
Modi quoted the nice lines ‘World is one, all are relation’ in Tamil.
But he did not refer to Jammu Kashmir at any point during his speech.
The reason for this is the strong determination of the central government that Jammu Kashmir is an internal problem of India.
With Pakistan wishing to make it an international issue, Modi has intentionally avoided any words about Jammu Kashmir, say political observers.
This has sent a message to the countries of the world that Kashmir is an internal issue of India.
