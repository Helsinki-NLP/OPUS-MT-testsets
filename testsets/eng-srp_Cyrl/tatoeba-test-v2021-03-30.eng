The students have returned.
What did you buy?
Is there any proof?
I'll do it with pleasure.
I don't know who they are.
I saw Tom die.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Have fun while you can.
I'm not going to say anything.

He came.
We talked about it all night.

I'm sorry, the line is still busy.
What's wrong with you?
What should you do?
"You talk too much," he said.
I got off the train.
You promised you would help me.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
I don't know why my head hurts.

I'm just kidding.
Pardon me, do you speak English?
Move quietly.
Everyone was young once.
Good-bye!

There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.

The house is made of brick.

Man has many wishes that he does not really wish to fulfil, and it would be a misunderstanding to suppose the contrary. He wants them to remain wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfilment would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally, and yearn for death.
