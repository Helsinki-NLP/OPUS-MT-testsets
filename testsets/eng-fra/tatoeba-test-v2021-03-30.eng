Stop goading your little brother! 
I'll get over it one way or another.

While the Kabyle people were fighting French colonialism in the 1940s and 1950s, the Algerians said: "What is the Kabyle problem with France?" Then, after the independence of Algeria, the roles were reversed by the fake Algerian media. The Kabyles have become "Zouaves" and the Algerian Arabs heroes who liberated Algeria.

We moved away from each other. 
I'll try to solve the problem by myself.

What's Ido? 
Can you be here within five minutes? 
Freedom is always the freedom of those who think differently. 
I'm talking in French so that Tom doesn't understand me. 
The community was organized and close-knit. 
I heard that you're looking for a job. 
He's minted, but he's not happy. 
Check everything once more. 
Where will Tom spend Christmas? 
My dog was barking and showing its fangs. 
Kabylia covers several provinces: Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia, part of Bouira and parts of the city of Boumerdes, Jijel, Setif and Bordj Bou Arreridj. Gouraya National Park and Djurdjura National Park are also located in Kabylia. 
I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
