He's my son.
I'll start swimming very soon.
How are you coming?
The baby cried.
What did you talk about?
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Lalita called.
My father often falls asleep while watching television.
She's not at home now.
He has two pencils. One is long and the other one is short.
Old people walk slowly.
Ah! How beautiful the Taj Mahal is!
We haven't slept in days.
Ramudu went to school.
He touched me.
He is Ramudu.
Tom washed his hands and face.
Oh no! He fell down!
Definitely!
Are you guys doing well?
I remembered that you were my brother.
Is it really true?!
When will Sita go to Eluru?
That wasn't easy, you know.
What's in the box?
Is there water there?
This plant has some burnt leaves.
Are you for real?!
The station is nearby.
Tom washed the lenses of his glasses with warm, soapy water and dried them on a cloth.
Do you usually eat breakfast before seven?
Did all this really happen?
That kid is a little demon.
It was apparent that there was no way out.
Sita smiled pleasantly.
Have you completed your homework?
Some of the dogs are alive.
There are islands in the sea.
Have you finished your meal?
He is teaching Spanish to the children.
At what time should we go to the station?
Happy International Women's Day!
Where did you put my book?
She taught music for thirty years.
He made her a bookshelf.
Mary freaked out when she heard what Tom had done.
There's no reason to be afraid.
The day is not over yet.
She refuses to say more about it.
We want to hear it.
Are you still afraid something might happen?
This made me very sad.
I should've been able to do that by myself.
Can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is?
None of them are present.
What's your room number?
When will you next visit?
As far as I know, she's not yet married.
We don't understand French.
The baby cried loudly.
Have you ever been to Paris?
She has no children.
We should get rid of her.
My bag was nowhere to be found.
They will sing a song.
You seem very happy.
We need to hire people we can trust.
Why aren't you ready?
Show me where it hurts you.
Give this book to Ramu.
The baby is crying for milk.
I know you're going to say no.
These pencils are the same color.
I'll be very careful.
I ran home.
Have you done your homework?
This is a pretty stupid question.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Which color do you prefer, blue or green?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
She sat on the bench.
My sister is crazy about tennis.
I don't trust that guy.
I dislike coffee.
How about going out to eat tonight?
Ramudu came.
It's hard to blame them.
What did you talk about?
Are you guys OK?
Aw, has he fallen!
You must stay where you are.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
What are you and Tom doing tomorrow?
We played basketball yesterday.
Give this to Ramu.
Sita smiled.
I've never been to Japan.
They're animals.
How many mangoes do you want?
What's the time now?
I don't know where they are.
He hung up.
Is everything going well with everyone?
Thank you for greeting me.
It's difficult to speak English well.
I'm really sorry about last night.
I wouldn't go there today if I were you.
We did that deliberately.
Oh! Raju has fallen down the stairs!
These socks don't stretch when you wash them.
She's not a doctor.
Why are you still not sleeping?
He dressed up as a woman.
How did you draw this picture?
There was nothing left.
Children are fond of cake.
What he says makes no sense at all.
You've arrived very early.
Bananas are delicious.
Let's take that chance.
Bring tea.
What is the price of that book?
Come, I'll serve some for you.
I can't keep you here any longer.
You must speak in a loud voice.
I'll let it go this time.
I don't need anything.
How many mangoes do you want?
How tall is she?
I've thought of that.
What will you have?
This is me eating a banana.
This is not a sentence.
Mary could've lied to you, but she didn't.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
She was pale with fear.
Sitting down all day is bad for you.
Let him stay there.
Is your homework finished?
How are you?
Which is your pen?
Oh! Marvelous!
She scared the cat away.
The movie's about to start.
Oh! Is it true?
Why did you call me?
Has the rose blossomed?
When will uncle come from Vijayawada?
Yes, you can.
People believe that god exists.
I've made a mistake, though I didn't intend to.
I'm learning the Burmese language.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.
It's high time you left for school, isn't it?
It's not all your fault.
I'm hungry again.
My dad is not at home for the moment.
Ramudu came to school.
Has Lata come?
I do make mistakes.
Mary's boyfriend threatened to leave her.
That's a party.
Tom was very scared.
Is your homework done?
My head hurts.
Where words fail, music speaks.
Is the work done?
What! Is this true?
What time is it?
I don't know who won.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I think that won't help.
I'm getting off at the next bus stop.
Was it really that bad?
I'm not allowed to do that here.
What is the time now?
Are you feeling OK?
I began to speak.
Mary bought a fake Gucci handbag.
She was on her way to school.
Mike is coming to dinner this evening.
Not only you but I also was to blame.
Do you know the reason why she is so angry?
That sounds really interesting.
"Is this Chinese or Japanese?" "It's Korean."
We'd better leave her alone.
Help came too late.
Oh! Is what you said true?
You have no need to be ashamed.
Go there.
What are you saying?
I asked you, "is the work done?"
Don't interfere with my work.
Killing two birds with one stone
Read this.
Do you have anything further to say?
Wrong.
She breathed in the cold air.
It's very valuable.
Did you do yesterday's homework?
What else I can lose?
Are you mad?
When you're a father, you'll understand.
He was a great poet as well as a doctor.
Tell me about your daily life.
You may go swimming or fishing.
My computer is expensive.
Where is Mary?
He earns three times as much as I.
I never actually saw him.
Are you prepared to do this?
How's everyone doing?
How are you?
Go there tomorrow!
I'm usually the one who does that.
Has Lata come from school?
Why can't giraffes sing?
Ah! How serene is this temple!
I'm sure he will come.
It wasn't my fault.
The work is almost done.
I heard you were sick.
Why did you lie to her?
It actually isn't that simple.
You are chubby.
A cat came out from under the desk.
Bring tea immediately!
I don't have time to talk right now.
I don't speak Japanese.
Brush your teeth every day.
When did you quit smoking?
Her arms and legs are long.
Read this in the evening.
She asked me how many languages I spoke.
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
He washed the blood off his hands.
You have to come at once.
Can you see that?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
We need money to do anything.
I don't accept it.
Who are we?
I heard the bell ring.
Can I make a phone call?
The picture is nice, well done!
Where was your son?
Only animal products contain cholesterol.
More coffee, please.
I suggest you do that.
Read this in the evening!
He didn't keep his word.
Has the red rose blossomed?
Have you finished your homework?
With her heart pounding, she opened the door.
Yes?
Lalita called us to the wedding.
It's going to take all afternoon and maybe more.
He took revenge.
Well done! You have drawn this picture nicely.
I drank coffee.
