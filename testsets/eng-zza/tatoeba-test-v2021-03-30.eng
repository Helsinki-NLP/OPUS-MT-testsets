Mary is screaming.
I don't work today.
"Do you understand?" "No, I don't."
That's true too, isn't it?
Tom told me you were here.
Take him out of here.
He is afraid of the dog.
Tom isn't like you.
Why don't you talk to us now?
Analyn sold the cow.
I wash my hands before lunch.
Nobody can stop him.
Why did they do it?
I told him what you did.
Yes, I'm Tom's sister, but I'm not like him!
Ask her yourself.
My brother Jacques is fourteen years old.
It wasn't good.
He kissed the back of her hand.
I didn't forget about you, Tom.
It will grow old.
I want to go home and sleep.
Is that enough?
I forgot it.
Why did you say that?
They're expecting you.
Tom ran out of water.
I remember seeing you somewhere.
Who is it?
I haven't told Tom.
Go to Tom's house.
We'll find one.
Tom arrived.
I was at home.
Don't swim here.
We'll finish later.
Have you ever milked a cow?
Who did this first?
Get it out of here.
Go talk to her.
We aren't alone.
Tom likes singing.
Never tell a lie again.
Where did you take your shoes off?
You look tired.
You had a cat.
Is it true? Paul kissed Lily on the lips?
I ate with my parents.
Mary has a headache.
We don't know any songs.
Tell me that was a joke!
No one will come.
The village was silent.
Tusnelda was Arminio's wife.
Let's get them out of there.
Tom's married.
Tom will soon be a father.
What do you do here?
I think we can catch him.
How hot it is today!
Ken has two cats.
I don't want to go near him.
Sleep well, Timmy.
Don't worry. I'll look after your dog for you.
The wolves are near us.
Let somebody else do this.
I didn't sleep.
What's your wife's job?
We're waiting, Tom.
I want her behind bars.
We'll see them later.
Please drive slowly.
We never talk.
Don't be frightened.
We don't know what Tom said.
Did you see it?
She asked me: "Who arrived first?"
I didn't understand the joke.
We'll be killed.
Nobody understood me.
Tom was hungry.
Do you think it'll rain today?
I am too short.
Tom wanted to sell it.
I've worked with them.
I'm here, too.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
I want to come back here.
What? You can't do it? You coward! Chicken!
I've done this.
Do you like fish?
Tusnelda was the wife of Arminio.
I will stop you.
I bought it from her.
We missed you.
Take either of the apples.
Tell them I'll be back.
I never saw her again.
I can go there by foot.
Have we forgotten anything?
You can't stop them.
No one laughed.
I own one cat.
Tom saw it.
You're not my father.
There is snow on the mountains.
They're not jealous.
Dan is my new friend.
This game is not bad.
Let's take Tom with us.
We're buying.
I don't want to talk to you today.
She looks well. She looks good.
My father is so old that he can't work.
I've never seen her.
I saw her just the other day.
Thanks to all of you.
What are we here for?
How many people still speak your language?
Last night, I didn't sleep.
I'm taking it to him.
Ask again later.
I like all languages.
Few people speak my language.
Tom and I will help you.
I don't like Tom at all.
Wait for them.
The children will be happy.
You are taller than I.
This old house is made of wood.
The road goes north from here.
They just taught me to swear.
I think I'm going to get fired.
He will not come today.
Wait for me, I am coming.
Who kissed her?
I'll never forget what you did.
Tom says he's not hungry.
Are all of them your friends?
We'll find her.
Who is this woman?
He's taller than me.
He will come tomorrow.
What are they saying?
One day, we will understand.
We'll leave now.
Stay away from this.
I'm taking you with me.
What are we looking for?
I hope you don't get lost.
Mary scared us.
Tom will protect you.
What's this dog's name?
She is not jealous.
Get me up at eight.
Two brothers went to travel together.
This is a man.
We saw you come in.
It's a game for children.
The cat which you found is mine.
If you don't do that, you will be a dead man.
We'll be together.
I am not hungry.
"Where are you?" "I'm here!"
They could not swim.
You can go to sleep now.
You can sit here.
Stop, I say.
Now I don't know what to do.
The cat is not mine.
This door won't shut.
The horse is white.
I didn't go with her.
I want him to be arrested.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
This reminds me of her.
We'll go out.
Is somebody there?
You look tired. You must have been working too hard.
We stole it.
Why did Tom leave Boston?
These are people.
There is an apple in the boy's pocket.
I can't do any more than this.
Tom smelled it.
She has green eyes.
I can't be friends with him.
The day was hot.
I sent Tom back home.
He looked at me and laughed.
We are both her girlfriends.
He told me to speak more slowly.
Will you come back tomorrow?
He will bring Tom.
Close the door!
I know this.
Who is your mother?
The best mirror is an old friend.
He taught me everything I know.
I was late for work.
We can protect you.
Tom said Mary was his daughter.
I want you to come with us tonight.
Tom stayed there for three days.
We'll catch Tom.
I will find you, Charley.
I know you're in here.
I didn't recognize him.
Are you gonna kill me?
That's his house.
I told him we were friends.
He blinked.
You're a beauty.
They are eating their apples.
Wait. I want to show you something.
You missed me, didn't you?
Do you like your brother?
Can you come back on Monday?
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
We heard.
I wanted to go there.
She seems OK now.
I caught a fish!
Tom's right.
Where does he want to go?
She saved us all.
That reminded me of you.
I'm taking this to him.
We want you here.
I heard his voice in my sleep.
Show me what you have got in your hand.
I was on the road.
Don't move till I get back.
I want to know why you're doing this.
We want to speak with Tom.
Is your wife home?
You tricked me.
He has green eyes.
We'll ask Tom.
Don't yell.
What the heart thinks, the mouth speaks.
Come and sit over here.
Do not speak for others.
That's not Tom.
We're finished.
I miss you too!
Tom's not fat.
Are you going to stay with us?
What's going to happen today?
Don't lie to yourself.
Owls are active at night.
I'm not fat.
Look! She's coming!
Tom was full.
I couldn't make it stop.
He threw a stone at the big dog.
Hanni and Nanni are twins.
They'll know what to do.
Tom will never give up.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
Who sings in the summer, works in the winter.
It is just noon.
Tell her I'm hungry.
The girl walked slowly.
Tom works nights.
The dog is yours.
If I want, they will kill you.
She has husband and two daughters.
How did you break it?
Tom took some food home.
Dick says, "I can swim."
Your father is tall.
Tomorrow I'll turn 28.
We can do this.
Everybody laughed at Tom.
Tom is as tall as Jack.
What do you think Tom will do?
Who did you get this from?
Go tell him yourself.
Tom! How nice to see you again!
I'm ashamed to go out dressed like this.
His son died last year.
We heard the door closing.
It's expensive.
They were scared.
Yesterday was the first day of autumn.
Keep your hands off me.
The house was silent.
What does it say?
I forgot you don't like carrots.
Can any of you tell me where Tom is?
I'm taking this to her.
Let him talk.
I can't see you.
Nobody wants to come.
I think Tom is crazy.
I want to bring her here.
Didn't you hear him?
He is about to leave.
This is a nice place.
This one is on me.
Emily's home.
Who will sing tonight?
Come get it.
Do you want me to tell you why?
Has Tom returned?
What did you say yesterday?
Did they ever find them?
Tom is your son, not mine.
Are you doing anything?
I'm hungry. How about you?
I didn't kill those guys.
I am talking with Tom.
I am not fat!
Tom looked inside.
I don't speak to Tom.
I closed my eyes and turned my head.
Why don't you be quiet and listen?
Good evening!
Mary is my wife.
Wait for me next to that tree.
We'll be neighbors.
Tom loves to fish.
I'm going out today.
Do you have dinner plans?
His dream came true.
Tom isn't hungry.
You're in the right place.
I like to swim.
Tom, I'm doing this for you.
Tom didn't laugh, did he?
You don't remember?
Here comes Tom now.
I saw his daughter was crying.
She's on her way home.
I didn't want to kill him.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
This is the house.
He will soon come back.
How did you come to hear of it?
I'm not dead, am I?
Right - clear, left - clear..., OK, all clear.
Who are you people?
I can hear Tom.
I don't want you to stay.
I can count to a hundred.
Tom will stop you.
We're going.
Tom went first.
I don't want to do anything tonight.
Did you do this all yourself?
Do you want to do this?
I want to try riding a horse.
Tom is short and fat.
Tom is a friend of my friend's.
Take her out of here.
She is sick.
The sky is getting dark.
No one has heard about this.
Tom knocked him down.
You'll die out there.
He wants to eat both of them.
Our grandfather is ill.
I heard her voice in my sleep.
Tom's asleep.
I want to grow old with Mary.
No one's here.
She can't love you.
I gave Tom a hug.
They didn't say that.
We can't all be like you.
She said to me, "Who arrived first?"
I will give you anything you want.
Do you study or work?
I hope you'll get well soon.
I came here with him.
No one can stop me now.
Come back and see us again.
Where did you see the boy?
They want it back.
Nothing can stop him.
He has holes in his clothes.
I can't be friends with her.
He saw nobody.
Tom is taller than me.
Nobody knew where he went.
I'll tell you what I want to do.
Don't go out because it is cold.
What did you say? I can't hear you.
Mary knows that.
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
My grandmother cannot see.
No one suspected him.
Do you like my clothes?
Tom only saw Mary once.
How old is your dog?
I'm older than your brother.
I saw them crying.
My father is two years younger than my mother is.
Don't you remember?
We'll find it.
Tom does not have friends.
He didn't tell me his name.
I'm twelve years old.
The next day he went away.
My mommy went outside.
I bought them for you.
Why is your mouth open?
Which house is his?
I don't feel at all tired.
"Me?" "Yes, you!"
Do I know Tom?
I'm only joking.
I'm going to do it.
You or I?
Where does your wife work?
I told her we were friends.
I did it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
Stay and watch.
Where is it that Tom wants to go?
We all know you.
She held my arm firmly.
I love you.
Hey, don't stop now.
Could you show me the way?
It's been ten years since my father died.
What were you eating?
Tom played with his kids.
Let's end this.
I have one thousand and five hundred cows.
I like children.
Don't walk on other people's land.
We can end it.
What did you say?
I talked to him again.
Mom, I'm hungry.
According to me we can do that.
Go to sleep now.
They went inside.
My parents don't know.
We'll be late.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Mary's shoes are dirty.
I have no kids.
If it doesn't rain, let's go out.
The sun sets.
I drink.
My knife is broken.
No one asked you.
They found Mary.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I'll bring it to you.
We'll come back.
I can't lie to you.
Do I look tired?
We'll speak to him later.
This is a woman.
Tom was a nice man.
We'll catch up.
The boy and the man are drinking water.
I'm taking it to her.
Did I hurt you?
Keep still.
Tom killed himself three months ago.
Do you remember what she said?
Where does he work?
Do you know whether Tom is married or single?
Nobody said that.
I love this language.
Did you buy him a dog?
I want her.
I'll be seventeen next year.
We will rescue them.
We're going out.
We'll work.
Tom, don't listen to them!
Tom didn't buy anything.
It's very cheap.
This is a boy.
I can't do anything like that.
I don't have any debt.
Tom didn't see you.
She went home and cried.
That was them.
Stay home.
You saw a mouse, didn't you?
Tom will be home soon.
Is Tom hungry?
I brought some friends with me.
How did you know Tom was sick?
Someone has died.
Tom, where are you? Everyone's looking for you!
I'm twenty-seven years old.
I don't want to go near her.
Go talk to them.
How old is your uncle?
I'm so hungry that I could eat a horse.
He will go in your place.
There was no one home.
Tom has gone away.
I knew you'd come back.
If I want, they will kill her.
Has anything changed?
Tom was sitting there.
The tree throws a shadow on the grass.
My name is Maria Sara.
He was alone there.
Miriam wanted to marry Thomas.
Are you lying right now?
Who came here?
I can't wait until tomorrow.
Are they big?
We're still here.
I want to find him.
He left this.
Tom said he'd be here.
We're eating dinner right now.
She likes these cats.
The cat got through the hedge.
I never saw her before today.
Will you go with her?
What's your wife's job? 
We're going out. 
Tom says he's not hungry. 
How did you come to hear of it? 
Who will sing tonight? 
Tom will soon be a father. 
Is somebody there? 
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother. 
I heard that you bought a new car. 
She was dying from boredom.
