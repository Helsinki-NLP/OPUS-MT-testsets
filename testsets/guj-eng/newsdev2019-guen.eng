Thousands in Central Park panic after barrier collapse
The collapse of a police barrier sent thousands of people fleeing in a panic in Central Park, afraid of possible gunshots at a politically-charged show.
Big-name personalities from Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake to Janet Jackson and John Legend urged spectators to get involved in the nation's troubled politics.
Authorities quickly assured the crowd they were safe after the barrier fell Saturday evening.
Burning social justice issues dominated the event that started on a sunny afternoon.
About 60,000 people filled the park's Great Lawn for the Global Citizen Festival, also awaiting Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars.
Some speakers asked the audience to call their Congress members to react to this week's Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Anna Hazare will go on hunger strike from 2nd October. He wrote a letter to PM Modi.
Maharashtra: The social activist Anna Hazare has announced hunger strike from 2nd October.
Anna Hazare has heavily criticized the Prime minister mentioning that BJP-led government has come to the power in the centre due to the Lokpal movement.
Four years have passed but the government is avoiding electing Lokpal and Lokayukt for some reason or other.
He added that regarding the Lokpal election, he will go on hunger strike from 2nd October and he remains firm in his decision.
Anna Hazare wrote a letter to PM Modi on Thursday alleging that in four years the government has just given excuses and has not appointed the Lokpal.
Anna wrote that on 16th August 2011, for the election of the Lokpal and Lokayukt, the whole country was marching on the roads.
Your government has come to power due to this movement.
Earlier Anna had also announced that on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, he will start fasting from 2nd October in Ralegan Siddhi.
He told the news agency on Friday that farmers are not getting the right prices for their produce.
Because of which they are killing themselves.

We shall not risk the sovereignty of Pakistan.
On the cancellation of talks between the foreign ministers' talk, Quereshi said that Pakistan wanted to discuss all the issues with India. But India gave priority to domestic politics. Hence they cancelled it.
In the United Nations forum, Pakistan has not forgotten to talk about the Kashmir issue again.
Qureshi added in his speech that "we want to resolve disputes through a serious and comprehensive discussion.
Which includes all the issues of concern.
We should not forget that in the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Sushma Swaraj had condemned Pakistan on Saturday.
Not only that, she also referred to the 9/11 mastermind Osama-Bin-Laden and mastermind of Mumbai attacks Hafiz Saeed in her UN address.
Sushma Swaraj mentioned that Pakistan is a neighbouring country that has mastered the art of spreading terrorism as well as refusing to take responsibility for their actions.

He was killed but the one behind the 26/11 Mumbai attack; mastermind Hafiz Saeed is still alive in Pakistan.
He is carrying out rallies, nominating candidates in the elections and threatening India.
Sushma said that Pakistan considers a terrorist as a freedom fighter, and if Pakistan doesn't stop such behaviour, the whole world will be burnt in the fire of terrorism.

When will we open the doors to our temples for the women having periods?
My newly wedded friend told me almost two weeks ago that she was preparing for the first Trij festival of her life.
Trij is basically a festival celebrated in North India where a woman prays for happy married life.
For Trij festival, the married woman fasts the whole day and worships at night.
While talking to me, my friend was quite eager and happy.
She had also bought a new sari to wear on Trij and even put mehendi on both her hands.
Even I was very glad to see her. But in the morning of the Trij festival, she got her period.
After that her mother and mother-in-law both forbade her from fasting and worship.
The other women of the household also advised my friend to stay away from the worship room, telling her she should not touch anything used in prayers.
Other women keeping the fast of Trij were advised to stay away from my friend.
Periods and entry to the home temple
After the incident, when my friend called me and talked as she cried, I felt as if someone had stabbed me in the heart.
I thought about her eagerness and the preparation for the Trij festival.
I looked at the picture of her mehendi on WhatsApp once more and even my eyes were wet.
I angrily told her that along with the Trij festival she should have also left that religion which instead of awakening the feelings of love and kindness, deciding on whether she should enter the temple during periods or not.
When the news of the Supreme Court's order dismissing the restriction on entry of women in Sabrimala temple was being flashed on numerous TV screens, I remembered this incident of my friend and her Trij festival in Bhopal.
What was the Sabrimala issue?
Until now 10 to 50 year old women were not allowed to enter the temple of Sabrimala in Kerala.
The temple, which is considered one of the main pilgrimage centres of India has had this ban for hundreds of years.
The reason behind this discrimination was the temple's logic that Lord Ayappa had remained unmarried throughout their life.
Hence women who could get their period cannot go and worship there.
The Indian Young Lawyers Association challenged the ban of the temple by registering a petition in the public interest in 2006 in the supreme court.
After hearing the arguments from both the parties for 12 years, the five member constitutional benches of the supreme court gave its verdict on 28th September, 2018.
What did the Supreme court say?
Chief Justice Deepal Mishra, Justice R.
Nariamn, Justice A.M.
Khanwilkar and Justice Chandrachud of the constitutional bench of supreme court said that the ban on women's entry into the temple was a violation of Article 14 of the constitution.
The bench mentioned, "without discrimination, anyone should be allowed to worship in the temple."
The fifth and the only woman in this constitutional bench, Justice Indu Malhotra expressed dissatisfaction with the decision of the other four judges and the court gave the above verdict at 4-1.
Irrational blind faith
While reading about the court's verdict, I was thinking of my niece.
My teenage niece started getting her periods about two days ago.
Once in a panic, she told me that when she had her periods, her grandmother had forbidden her from entering the room where they kept the temple.
Apart from that, she was also forbidden from entering the kitchen and touching the pickle jars.
My niece said, "that day her mum had made her favourite curry."
She was so hungry that she forgot about her periods.
And ran to the kitchen to get the curry.
"Later the grandmother scolded my mum." With this my niece questioned me why such rituals?
I didn't have any answer to her question.
Like my niece, many teenagers growing up in Indian households are asking for the answer from us.
The question is that the supreme court has lifted the ban on women's entry into Sabrimala but when will we remove the irrational faith from our minds?
When will we open the gates of our house temple, kitchen and heart for the women with their monthly?
Periods are a normal process associated with reproduction.
How can the process that has created the world and is the reason behind our existence be impure?
If a woman is unclean for these five days of the month, we must end such a measure of purity.
The Supreme court has stood with us going against the whole world, but the question is, that as a society, when will we stand with the other half of our population?
Tribal Sardar of Kerala is not leaving the forest despite floods.

Alastair Seeley continues British Supersport winning run at Assen
Alastair Seeley has continued his winning form in British Supersports
Alastair Seeley took his third win in five British Supersport races by taking victory in Saturday's 12-lap sprint race at Assen in the Netherlands.
The Carrickfergus rider took the chequered flag by 0.05 seconds from fellow Yamaha rider Jack Kennedy.
The 38-year-old also won races at Silverstone and Oulton Park this month.
Seeley is competing for the Northern Ireland-based EHA Racing outfit for whom he won a race at the North West 200 international road races in May.
The former British champion and Kennedy were involved in a race-long scrap and despite the Dubliner's last-ditch attempts he was unable to squeeze past the Northern Irishman.
Seeley's team-mate David Allingham was seventh in Saturday's Supersport race.
Scott Swann was eighth in the British Talent Cup race.
Glenn Irwin was fourth quickest in qualifying for Sunday's two British Superbike races on his Be Wiser Ducati as he aims to improve on his current fourth place in the championship standings.
It was revealed earlier this week that Irwin would switch to the JG Speedfit Kawasaki team for the 2019 season.
Toomebridge pilot Michael Laverty was 13th on his Tyco BMW and Andrew Irwin 14th on the second of the PBM Ducatis.

Doughnut seller Lina Ognissanti to be honoured by Bedford mayor
Image caption Lina Ognissanti sells ice creams in warmer months and doughnuts during the winter
A woman who has sold doughnuts and ice creams in a town centre for more than 40 years is to be honoured with a private mayoral reception.
Lina Ognissanti, who runs Dinky Donuts and an ice cream stall on Midland Road, Bedford, has been invited to afternoon tea, along with her family.
Almost 3,000 people signed an online petition to get her an award or recognition.
Mrs Ognissanti said it was an "honour" to be thought of so highly.
The Mayor of Bedford, Dave Hodgson, said Mrs Ognissanti, along with her children and grandchildren, had been invited to his parlour to view the civic regalia and historical artefacts and to have afternoon tea.
"Lina has a special status in Bedford, and her stand is an institution in the town centre," he said.
"I'm delighted that Lina has accepted my invitation and I look forward to welcoming her to the parlour in order that we can show our appreciation for her contribution to the town."
Mrs Ognissanti thanked the "lovely" people of Bedford for thinking of her, and said: "It is a great honour, and really nice."
Sarkab Mahmood, who started the petition, said he had not expected such a huge response.
On hearing about the reception, which is set to take place by the end of the year, he said: "I am really happy for her, it is all down to Lina being such a great person."
Rolling with the Ulster Lambretta Club
Lambrettas were an essential accessory in the mod scene of the 1960s.
The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts of the Italian motor scooter.
Around 100 scooters from all over the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh this weekend, 70 years after the first Ulster Lambretta Club was formed.
Chris Wilson, one of two members of the original club, bought his first Lambretta for around £40 in 1966.
"A scooter was just to me a form of transport, but then there was the option to use it for other things.
It was a bit of sport.
I never did get into the mod scene and I'm probably far too old now for it," he said.
"Basically it was relatively cheap, relatively reliable and they were available for the right amount of money and once you had one there were other things you could do with it other than just riding from A to B."
He used to race Lambrettas in time trials around the TT circuit on the Isle of Man.
The first Ulster Lambretta Club wound up in the early 1970s but it was reformed 12 years ago.
"It started to die out around 1971, the interest in scooters, other forms of transport and the Troubles didn't help with clubs in general, so I thought, 'No that's it, finished'," Chris said.
"And then sometime back there were showings of the interest in it and it seems to have grown and grown."
Philip Steele is the membership secretary of the Ulster Lambretta Club which currently has 97 members.
"Everyone's got their own take.
Obviously there'll be guys influenced from the whole mod scene, that's where a lot of it started.
Other guys are into the racing scene, rockers, there's a mixture of everyone in it here.
Some people are just into the vintage thing.
Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same.
You can either keep them original and potter along at 35 or 40 mph they were originally designed to go around the small streets in Italy, but some of the guys have tuned these things.
Some of these bikes here probably could do upwards of 100 mph, the super tuned ones. "
There were a few breakdowns and push starts over the weekend.
And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as the Lambretta's Italian home, the sun was shining as the scooters toured around County Fermanagh.
Ruth Davidson calls for Tory Brexit 'silence'
Ruth Davidson has called for a "period of silence" among her Conservative colleagues to allow the prime minister to get a Brexit deal "over the line."
The Scottish Tory leader said the two years following the EU referendum had provided enough time for debate.
Her comments follow Boris Johnson's description of the Chequers plan as "deranged and entirely preposterous."
She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland it was now time to get behind the prime minister.
As Tory activists assembled in Birmingham for their party conference, she said: "There's been time over the last two years for debate.
The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year.
Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country.
In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one."
Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.
Theresa May later insisted she did believe in Brexit, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union.
Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 "the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event."
Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: "In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want.
I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for."
M8 fully reopens after police incident
The M8 motorway in Glasgow has been fully reopened after being shut by a police incident.
Police said the route was closed in both directions at junction 15 Townhead shortly before 07:00 amid concern for the wellbeing of a pedestrian.
The closure resulted in the route being at a standstill for three hours and traffic disruption in the city, which is hosting the Great Scottish Run.
A 20-year-old man was later taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for checks.
Christine Blasey Ford's friend clarifies statement about alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh
Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while they were both teenagers, has written a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee to clarify that although she does not remember the house party where the misconduct allegedly occurred, she believes Ford's account.
Keyser had previously released a statement through her attorney saying that she did not remember the party in question, and that she does not remember ever meeting Kavanaugh.
In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee Thursday, Kavanaugh often brought up Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, although he omitted that Keyser said that she believed Ford.
President Trump instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation within one week on Friday, after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and other moderate senators called for a weeklong delay on a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation to give time for an investigation.
On Saturday, Keyser said through her lawyer in a letter to the committee that she was willing to "cooperate fully with the FBI's supplemental investigation" into Kavanaugh.
"However, as my client has already made clear, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford," the letter from Howard Walsh, Keyser's attorney, said.
It continued that Keyser "does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account."
"However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question," the letter continued.
Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh's who was allegedly present during the assault, has also said that he will cooperate with the FBI investigation.
Wrongfully convicted Chicago residents recall life under corrupt cop and his "gang"
The top prosecutor in Illinois is trying to turn the page from a dark period in Chicago police history.
It's believed that one bad cop preyed on innocent residents of a housing project, rounding up dozens of people on bogus charges.
So far, 42 wrongly convicted people have been exonerated.
An empty lot is now all that's left of the Ida B. Wells housing project where a group of corrupt Chicago cops preyed almost risk-free on residents for most of a decade.
Sergeant Ronald Watts was their ringleader.
Residents have accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, filing false police reports, planting evidence and assault.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those exonerated so far by Cook County state attorney Kim Foxx.
"If you didn't cooperate with him, you was going down.
You was against him.
You was against his operation and his way of getting money," Cleon Glover said of Watts.
"I was terrified.
I was trying to get away, get out of that neighborhood.
I had nowhere to go," Willie Martin said.
Lawyers from Foxx's conviction integrity unit are reviewing 30 to 40 additional cases connected to Watts.
Ida B. Wells housing resident Landon Allen said a lot of people spoke up about Watts.
"Everybody spoke up," he said.
"But it didn't matter."
As Clarissa Baker, another former resident, pointed out, it was their word against a sergeant with a badge.
"He has his own gang.
So who would believe us?"
Baker said.
Joshua Tepfer of the University of Chicago's exoneration project says the answer until recently was no one.
"They let it go on because they viewed these people as disposable and they didn't care because they're black people in the housing projects who in their minds were guilty of something anyway," Tepfer said.
"Sgt. Watts went to prison in 2013 and served 22 months for trying to steal from an FBI informant.
Martez Wise went to prison too - because of Watts.
During that time I had just had my son.
I was away from him for four years.
He barely even know who I was because he was just born, so I had to re-bond with him," Wise said.
"Four years taken away for nothing."
72-year-old Fidelity bets on the future with blockchain, virtual reality and AI
Fidelity recognized the potential in blockchain before it became the corporate buzzword of 2018.
CEO Abby Johnson led the charge into cryptocurrency, one of the riskiest and most volatile asset classes of the past year.
"A few plus years ago, myself and a few other senior executives here were just curious about what was going on, particularly with bitcoin," Johnson said.
We started getting together to say 'we're got to understand this.'
The curiosity led them to start bitcoin "mining," at a location in New Hampshire when the crypto's price was around $180.
Flash forward to December of last year when bitcoin rose to almost $20,000, "behold - the price goes up and all the sudden we're making money, which was never the intent," Johnson said.
She did not specify how much bitcoin has been mined, or how much money Fidelity made.
There's clear interest in the topic by Fidelity employees.
Its blockchain club for employees called "bits and blocks," hosts seminars, office hours and meet ups, now has roughly 2,600 members.
The company has an arrangement with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, it started facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin.
Many other potential uses for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been scrapped by now or "put on the shelf," Johnson said.
We're trying to listen to the marketplace.
In the meantime, Katie Chase, the head of strategy for Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and head of the Blockchain Incubator (which is a part of FCAT), is exploring uses for both public blockchain and enterprise blockchain.
Chase could not comment specifically on the projects but said she's seen massive interest from clients and partners, as well as their own employees.
"It's still very nascent.
All of the stuff that you're reading about, if you dig under the covers is still in the proof of concept stage," Chase said.
We tried to apply blockchain to some use cases where we learned a lot but the technology isn't mature enough to solve these problems."
For now, the group is more focused on what some of those barriers are, she said.
They're looking at how to "tokenize" physical items, like a piece of art for example, or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space.
"Those are on the shelf, but we think they'll eventually come off," Chase said.
"Fidelity will be well-equipped when they do."
She used the example of Pebble watch, a failure by retail standards but something that paid off for Fidelity.
Her group had created an app for the smartwatch, which shut down three years after raising millions through a crowdfunded kickstarter campaign.
When the Apple Watch finally came to market, Fidelity was ready.
It used the app developed for Pebble to quickly go live on Apple's new product.
"We were not betting that the Pebble watch is the next big thing - but in case we have people wearing these things on their wrist, we wanted to be there too," she said.
"It gave us the learning for when the smart watch did go to mass market, and we were able to be there."
Earthquake, tsunami strike island of Sulawesi
A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, September 29, triggering a tsunami and leaving nearly 400 people dead.
Hundreds were also injured, and the death toll was expected to rise.
Electricity and communications have been cut off, making it difficult to assess the damage in the city of Palu and nearby fishing community of Donggala, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency says.
California HS students spell racial slur on lettered T-shirts
The Escondido Union High School District this week confirmed that about 10 students at a senior event "made a poor decision" by participating in the stunt involving the racial slur, CNN affiliate KGTV reported.
"We are a campus that prides itself on inclusion and embraces diversity," Principal Adriana Lepe-Ramirez said in a statement.
"We will not tolerate actions that send messages of racism and promote divisiveness."
The statement said Escondido High School, district officials and local police were investigating the incident, the station reported.
"Parents and guardians of the students involved are being contacted by school administrators, and appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken," the statement said.
During the senior picnic, students at the school north of San Diego wear lettered shirts and are photographed spelling out words while standing side by side, the station reported.
The words are usually approved ahead of time but some students spell out their own words after the official photo is taken.
The district statement said the activity was "not aligned with Escondido High School's culture, values or history."
"We all need to understand the power of our words and actions, and we must take responsibility for the decisions we make each and every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"At Escondido High School we will continue to work every day to build a culture of family and unity across our community."
Cade Pannell, a former student who saw the offensive photo on social media, told KGTV the image made him angry.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
"Whether they thought it was a joke, it's not.
And if you do think it's a joke, I think that's very ignorant of you."
Shaquille O'Neal's Son Shareef to Undergo Heart Surgery, Miss 1st Season at UCLA
Shareef O'Neal, son of Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, will miss his freshman season at UCLA because of a heart problem.
Per TMZ Sports, O'Neal will have surgery to correct the issue that was discovered when UCLA doctors were conducting a routine checkup.
"Thank God the UCLA medical staff caught it early," O'Neal told TMZ.
"During rehab, I'll be attending my classes and being a normal student.
I'll be back in no time."
O'Neal officially signed a letter of intent to play at UCLA in August, adding another marquee name to one of the nation's best freshman classes for the 2018-19 season.
"Shareef has made great strides throughout his high school career," Bruins head coach Steve Alford told reporters last month.
"He's an outstanding addition to our incoming class and brings a terrific combination of size, skill and athleticism.

Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with beating up his father
Track Palin, 28, was arrested on three charges, including assault
Sunday's incident is not his first arrest related to domestic violence
The incident happened at the Palin home in Wasilla, Alaska, where Track Palin bloodied his father, Todd, in a dispute over a truck, according to court records.
The 28-year-old was arrested on three charges, including assault, after the incident Saturday.
The dispute began when he called to say he wanted to come get the truck, and his father refused, according to court documents.
Track Palin was arrested on charges of first-degree burglary, fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal mischief, and his father suffered injuries to his face and head, the court filing shows.
Track Palin called the officers on the scene "peasants" and told them to abandon their weapons when they attempted to communicate with him, the documents say.
At one point, he got onto the garage roof before eventually being detained, the court filing says.
Sarah Palin said her son was "freaking out" and "was on some type of medication," according to the court documents.
Track Palin also told the police he had consumed a few beers earlier, the documents say.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence assault involving a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," the former Republican vice presidential candidate and governor of Alaska said at the time.
"And it makes me realize, more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America's finest that we have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them."
Elizabeth Warren says she think about presidential run after the midterms
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," the Democratic senator told a town hall crowd in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"So here's what I promise: After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."
Warren, who is defending her seat this year against a challenge from Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, had previously downplayed expectations of a run saying she is focused on her work in the Senate.
"It is really important that we focus on midterm elections and stop acting like the only important shiny object in the room is 2020," she told reporters during her speech at the National Press Club in August.
"The important fight coming up right now is midterm election, and that's true in Massachusetts, It's true all across this country."
Warren has long been considered a potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee to take on President Donald Trump.
However, she would likely face a highly contested primary race, as several other high-profile Democrats are mulling runs for the highest office, including former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.
Third mystery death is linked to celebrity mental health clinic in less than a year
An exclusive private psychiatric hospital is believed to have suffered a third suicide in less than a year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.
Shaquelle Vidal, 23, the daughter of a TV comedian, died on April 7 after spending almost a month as a "voluntary" patient at the Nightingale Hospital in Marylebone, West London.
She was the girlfriend of James Lyle, 57, a millionaire hedge fund boss and former Conservative Party donor, who met the five-figure cost for her care.
The trainee chef's death came almost exactly six months after that of socialite and artist Daisy Boyd, 28, the granddaughter of River Cafe co-founder Rose Gray.
Miss Boyd, who had struggled to deal with her split from publishing heir Dan Macmillan, 43, died on October 5 under the influence of cocaine smuggled in by a visitor.
Two months earlier, Alan MacDonald, 61, a film set designer, took his life four days after being discharged from the hospital.
In May, the Care Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale for doing too little to combat "illicit substances" being brought on to the premises.
Shaquelle, the daughter of BBC's Mock The Week panellist Ava Vidal, went into the hospital on March 11.
Katie Gollop QC told a pre-inquest hearing at Westminster Coroner's Court last week that she had gone "AWOL" on March 29 and when she returned a week later, her mental state had deteriorated.
Ms Gollop, acting for Ava Vidal, said: "My client would like to piece together what was happening to Shaquelle... to understand who it was she was in contact with, and what she was doing."
She referred to Mr Lyle as Shaquelle's "boyfriend."
Comedy director John Gordillo, 52, who was described as Shaquelle's "unofficial stepfather," said: "I know Shaquelle was still in contact with James Lyle, and he was based in New York at the time."
Mr Gordillo told the hearing that on April 4 he called the hospital "more than a dozen times" in 20 minutes after Shaquelle rang him to claim she wanted to buy and take cyanide, but that no one answered.
"It seems to me that, had someone picked up during that period, what followed could have been avoided," he added.
On April 5, a doctor at the hospital assessed Shaquelle as being "acutely psychiatrically unwell."
Less than 48 hours later, she hanged herself using a laptop cable.
A Nightingale spokesman extended sympathy to her family and friends and said: "Our hospital is committed to providing high standards of care in a safe and therapeutic environment."

Led Zeppelin face new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff for song Stairway To Heaven
Led Zeppelin facing a new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff from their hit 1971 classic Stairway To Heaven
The British band are accused a plagarising part of their hit song from 1971
Appeals court overruled 2016 verdict group did not copy from band called Spirit
Michael Skidmore, trustee for songs of Spirit guitarist, filed suit back in 2015
The song goes on a bit - and it looks like the plagiarism case surrounding Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven is going to be another long-player.
The band are facing a new trial over claims they stole a guitar riff for their 1971 ballad.
A US appeals court has overruled a 2016 verdict that the group did not copy the opening of their hit from music by the band Spirit.
It was said the judge in the trial had made errors, including misleading jurors about copyright law.
The case was sent back to court.
Michael Skidmore, trustee for the songs of Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, originally filed the suit in 2015.
Police chase ends when Michigan cop runs down murder suspect as he shoots at officers
A Michigan man suspected of murdering his girlfriend has been arrested after leading police on a chase that ended when he was mowed down by a police car.
Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected of shooting dead his girlfriend Tia Mae Randall, 27, Thursday in Wyoming, Michigan.
He was arraigned Friday in a hospital where he is being treated after an officer ran him down with a police SUV as Nolin shot at them while trying to flee on a busy highway.
Nolin has been charged with five felony counts including assault with intent to murder and fleeing police.
'Arraigning at the hospital certainly isn't the norm, but it's not unheard of either,' Wyoming Police Capt. James Maguffee said.
'He is getting the treatment he needs, but we need the wheels of justice to turn.
Judges will often make the accommodations to make that happen.'
The body of Nolin's girlfriend was found Thursday morning at Creekside Estates mobile home.
The mother-of-two was killed by a single gunshot and police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
Police then released an alert for the public to be on lookout for Nolin, giving a broad physical description of him and his 1996 black Dodge pickup truck.
He was spotted in his trick and as police tried to pull him over Nolin hopped onto US 131.
Nolin crashed his truck into a concrete median then got out and ran on foot down the highway.
As he ran, Nolin shot at the officers chasing him.
One cop took the police SUV and ran Nolin down from behind.
The event was captured on video by an onlooker.
He was transported to the hospital where he is in serious but stable condition and will remain until he is discharged and transferred to Kent County Jail.
'It shows the willingness of our police officers in West Michigan to put themselves in harm's way to protect this community,' Maguffee said.
'They got the guy in custody in an appropriate time frame and in an appropriate way and we're very proud of them.'
In all, Nolin is charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder, fleeing police, carrying a concealed weapon and felony use of a firearm.
He has yet to be charged in the death of his girlfriend as the homicide investigation remains active.
'There's absolutely an underlying homicide investigation that continues and we'll be close to wrapping that up and we'll present that to the Kent County prosecutor at the appropriate time,' Maguffee said.
Judge heaps praise on brave homeowner who knocked burglar's teeth out during break-in at his home
A judge has praised a householder who confronted two thugs trying to break into his home - giving him "full marks" for bravery.
Despite one offender swinging a plank of wood at him, 63-year-old David Oldham refused to be cowed.
Instead, the university estates manager fought back, punching both offenders and knocking one of the men's teeth out.
The criminals fled but blood left on Mr Oldham from the scuffle led to one of them, Craig Ford, being identified and arrested four months later.
Sentencing Ford, who lost a tooth after being hit by Mr Oldham outside his £400,000 detached home in Ormskirk, Lancashire, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, told him: "Mr Oldham gave you more than you bargained for because when he confronted you at the side of his house, disguised so only your eyes and nose were visible, he punched you.
And not only did he punch you but when your accomplice, who had been breaking in upstairs, jumped down from the roof he punched him as well.
Jailing Ford for three years and four months on Friday, the judge said: "You've learnt two lessons, I hope.
One is you do not mess with David Oldham, and two, you don't mess with the police.
For your pains in committing these offences you now have one tooth less than you had before and you got bitten by a dog.
It is the least you deserve."
He added: "Full marks to Mr Oldham for the way in which he responded to what you did."
Derek Jones, prosecuting, said that at the time of the burglary, Ford was on licence from a three-year sentence imposed in 2016, also for burglary.
Liverpool Crown Court heard Mr Oldham sprang into action when he heard noises outside his home at about 7pm on April 5.
Mr Jones said: "Mr Oldham, a man of some substance, bravely went out to the side of the property and was confronted by the defendant who moved towards him.
Fearing for his safety he punched him once to the face which knocked him to the floor and also knocked a tooth out.
The other intruder then jumped down from the roof landing in front of Mr Oldham who instinctively punched him to the face."
Mr Jones said the accomplice picked up a plank of wood and swung it at Mr Oldham, and Ford said: "Shoot him, he's knocked my teeth out."
The accomplice said to Mr Oldham: "We'll just leave it now if you let us go," and he and Ford fled the scene.
Police caught up with Ford when they raided a house in Wavertree on August 2.
Ford kicked out at a police dog, which then bit his shoulder.
The second burglar is believed to be still at large.
Ford, 25, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to burglary, assault by beating, and driving dangerously while disqualified and without a licence.
Blow for Boris as Tory activists CLAP attack on him in conference hall
Boris Johnson suffered a blow today as Tory activists clapped a vicious attack on him as 'irrelevant and offensive'.
Despite Mr Johnson wooing the grass roots with his hardline approach to Brexit, the brutal assessment from former trade minister Digby Jones went down well with members at conference in Birmingham this afternoon.
Meanwhile, David Davis swiped that Mr Johnson was focused on 'headlines' rather than sound policies.
And a Cabinet ally of Mrs May added to the woes by telling MailOnline that he was only making so much 'noise' because he did not have the 'numbers' for an all-out leadership bid.
The backlash came after the former foreign secretary launched another vicious attack on the PM's Chequers plan for Brexit - branding it 'deranged' and 'preposterous'.
Mr Johnson upped the ante by pointing out that she was a Remainer during the referendum two years ago - whereas he is a true believer in the project.
And he urged the government to back ambitious projects like building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
But a defiant Mrs May shot back that her critics were 'playing politics' and insisted she is 'not bluffing' about driving a hard bargain with the EU.
Speaking during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show to kick off Tory conference, Mrs May said: 'I do believe in Brexit.'
Lord Jones, a former Labour trade minister who now sits as an independent, pleased the crowd by praising the opportunities of Brexit.
But he prompted applause by referring to alleged remarks by Mr Johnson when he responded 'f*** business' in response to questions about the concerns they have raised.
Without naming Mr Johnson, Lord Jones took aim at the 'irrelevant and offensive person he really is'.
'Business is so important that when I heard a former foreign secretary say "f*** business," it showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is,' he said.
'I take great exception to that.'
Lord Jones also hailed the response by Mrs May - who watched the speech from the hall - to 'bullying' by EU leaders over her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit.
Earlier, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also took aim at Mr Johnson, pointing out that he had stayed as a senior member of the government during the Brexit negotiations.
A Cabinet ally of Mrs May played down the intervention, telling MailOnline that Mr Johnson does not have enough support among Tory MPs to oust the PM.
They said: "It is not that damaging to have stories like this in the papers today.
He is making a lot of noise, but Boris does not have the numbers in the parliamentary party, and he knows that is the case.
There is a big contrast between the respectful stance David Davis has taken, arguing his case, and the way Boris has pursued his own personal ambitions.
Business Secretary Greg Clark lashed Mr Johnson for attacking business for being sceptical about Brexit.
Speaking on the fringes of the Tory conference in Birmingham, Mr Clark said Mr Johnson's jibe was "totally the wrong thing to say."
He said: "I was surprised that anyone could even think like that.
There is no successful economy anywhere in the world that does not have successful and flourishing businesses.
In an interview with Sky News' Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis admitted that the next couple of months would be 'really scary' as the EU tried to force deep concessions from the UK.
But he said the government had to hold its nerve and push for a Canada-style agreement rather than Chequers.
He also delivered a stinging barb when asked about Mr Johnson's attractions as a Tory leader.
Ridiculing Mr Johnson's proposal of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said 'one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas'.
He added: 'We have a very knockabout friendships, but quite a lot of his ideas are good headlines but not good policies.'
Bulgaria spends £80million of European taxpayers' cash on bungled restoration
Bulgaria spends £80million of European taxpayers' cash on making ancient castles look like 'cheese and cardboard' in bungled restoration
The Balkan nation has spent £80million of the EU's Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning to former glory, construction work has made a mockery.
Local government near the Krakra fortress have vowed to undo shoddy work.
The Bulgarian government has spent tens of millions of EU money on botched restoration job on medieval castles.
The Balkan nation has spent £80million of the EU's Regional Development Fund to fix ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of returning them to their former glory, construction work has left them as laughing stocks.
The expensive reconstruction work has left the relics looking like they are made of 'cheese and cardboard' and this has turned tourists off the site.
The medieval for of Krakra in Pernik, western Bulgaria and the Roman fort of Trayanovi Vrata near Ihtiman among others have drawn the ire of conservationists after they were rebuilt with polymer concrete, often used to make pavements.
The Telegraph reported that both the EU and the government have privately admitted that lessons should be learnt from the debacle, according to a report.
'It's weeping - a weeping fortress,' Stella Duleva, a conservation architect, said of the Trayanovi Vrata.
'It had survived 16 centuries, and now it's ruined.'
Such was the backlash of the restoration of the Krakra fort in Pernik that local authorities have said they will dismantle the additions in 2019.
The Pernik fortress has been dubbed 'cardboard castle' because of shoddy moderations.
The Byzantine fort of Yailata has been dubbed 'cheese fortress' after it was rebuilt with smooth white blocks that clash with its weather-worn facade.
The strange debacle comes as the European Union faces fresh scrutiny as to how its development funds are spent.

Hammer thrower, 24, hits out after stranger on a train platform 'body shamed'
A British female athlete has today hit out after being 'body-shamed' by a stranger on a train platform.
Jessica Mayho, who won silver in hammer throwing at this year's British Athletic Championships, says she was abused at Leeds Station on Friday afternoon.
Miss Mayho, aged 24 and standing five feet 11 inches tall, said a man pushed and verbally abused her while she waited for a train.
The attacker then made comments about her 'big body' on the platform just before 5pm.
But the rising athletics star, who is aiming to compete for Team GB at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, confronted the man.
Miss Mayho, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: 'I stood up for myself whilst the rest of the busy platform avoided eye contact.
People like this can scare you and also knock self-confidence but this is MY body and MY machine.'
The young athlete received an outcry of support on social media after posting about her ordeal on Twitter.
Andy Lewis MBE wrote: 'Big body!!!!
Was he drunk or visually impaired?
What a fool, nothing wrong with you Jess.
Don't let one small minded idiot have any of your time.'
Gavin Gray added: 'Find it disgusting.
Not just him but the bystanders who ignored what went on.
Glad you're ok.
You are an inspiration to the next generation.
This says 'Be proud of who you are and if you have a problem with me eff off!.''
Miss Mayho, who works at the University of Leeds, was introduced to the hammer throw as a teenager by one of her older sister's coaches.
She has since claimed second place at the Muller Senior British Athletic Championships held in Birmingham in July this year.
This British silver medal came just a month after she was crowned North of England champion.
She has been approached for further comment but declined.
Facebook faces a fine of up to £1.25billion after at least 50million of its users were hacked
Criminals exploited security flaw to access at least 50million Facebook accounts
But the huge breach was only announced on Friday, three days after it happened
Facebook now bracing itself for a massive fine under new European data laws
Facebook could face a fine of up to £1.25 billion after at least 50million of its accounts were hacked.
Criminals exploited a security flaw to access the accounts, putting huge amounts of sensitive, personal information at risk.
But Facebook only announced the breach on Friday, three days after it happened -and was last night still unable to say how many British accounts had been affected.
As the hunt for the hackers continued, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner - which regulates the web giant's European data compliance as it is headquartered in Dublin - criticised the company, saying: "The notification lacks detail."
Facebook is now bracing itself for a massive fine under new European Union data laws that can require firms to pay out up to four per cent of its global turnover.
Facebook generated £31.2 billion in revenue last year.
The crooks gained access to accounts through Facebook's "view as" feature which allows users to see what their profiles look like when others view them.

An innocent girl was suffering from an eye disease in the hospital hall, and this father was lying drunk on the ground.
Gondal: a father had brought a three-year-old girl from the rural area to the Gondal's government hospital for eye treatment.
Instead of the girl's eye being treated; he fell down in a drunken stupor at the crossroad. As the word spread, some kind-hearted person informed the police, but the police did not take notice. Eventually, taking the help of a rickshaw, the drunkard was sent to his village.
He had brought the child for eye treatment.
Shiv Sena Public trusts serves poor patients. According to the details, President Dineshbhai Madhad stated that this morning, a father had brought a three-year-old girl from the rural area for eye treatment, but he was too drunk. The child was in a lot of pain.
But he didn't know, in order to avoid any mishap to the child, we informed the city police by telephone but the police didn't take any responsibility. Finally, we hired an auto rickshaw and had them sent to their village.
In recent times, children are treated very badly. Many times their parents are responsible in such cases. This drunkard father would not have realised if someone had grabbed his child and the police irresponsibly replied that they were helpless in such a case.

One lion is missing in Mota Baraman area, Forest Department was informed.
Suspicious of the lion being ill, lion lovers are concerned.
Rabarika round of the TulsiShyam Range, means a round without any protection.
In the Revenue region, known as the Mota Baramana Salwava, below the Raydi Pati Beat, a pair of 2 lions have stayed there a long time.
Both lions live together permanently and even hunted their prey together.
However, since one lion disappeared two days ago, the forest department has been informed by local farmers.
One lion has disappeared from the Raydi Pati Beat, avenue area, which falls below the Rabarika round of Tulsi Shyam range.
More than 15 lions are living here in this range.
In pairs of two lions, these lions, living in the Salva dhar area, are adults.
Just four days before, these two lions had enjoyed a banquet of lamb near the substation of Mota Baraman village.
The leftover lamb was moved to the protected place, not by the forest department but by the local people.
The two lions were then seen here for 2 days.
But in the last 48 hours, from the pair, one lion has not been seen.
So people of this area are concerned.
While reporting to the forest department, they are just sitting in the forest department doing the survey.
The possibility of one of the lions likely to have a loose bowel motion is being discussed amongst local farmers
It is necessary to take the stool samples of more than 15 lions of this area, and send it to the forensic lab.
Otherwise, there is any wonder if like the Dalkhiniyana range where the lions are dying like dogs, the event might repeat itself here too?
Need to send samples to the laboratory.
An employee of the forest department on condition of remaining anonymous said that more than 15 lions are living in the Rabarika round of the Tulsi Shyam range.
Their stools should be thick. Instead it is very thin.
When the lions get diarrhoea and their body become impaired, as soon as possible, it is necessary to move the location of these lions and send these samples to the forensic lab to know why their stools are not thick

Inquiry in office
Tulsi Shyam Range's RFO Parimal Patel avoided answering the phone when asked to comment on the incident.
And as if nothing had happened, sitting in the office, he was searching for the lion.
According to the forest sources.
Reported as the lion looked ill - Sudanese
In a telephonic conversation with Shivlal Sudanani, who had informed the forest department of Mota Baraman, he said that both of these lions and are a pair.
For last two days, one of these lions has not been seen and because I thought that lion was looking ill, I informed the forest department.

The possibility of the forest department and their relatives being responsible for the lion's death.
To cover this incident, when Delhi and Dehradun teams came to the spot for investigation, the truck load of the bones of dead animals, near Pavna Chakki, was removed from here.
Hetendra Singh Rathod, Khambha: The loss of 23 lions one after another at Sarsiya Vidi Dulkhaniya range of the Gir East region has disturbed the entire state.
Although this incident took place more than two weeks ago, the forest department has no solid information.
Following that, other healthy lions are being banned in the name of the virus and the incident is being diversified.
According to the data, there is a possibility that the forest department and their relatives are responsible for the lions' death.
According to the sources, at Sarsiya Vidi near Pavna Chakki, due to eating 14 sick goats, two cows and one dead buffalo infected with rabies, the lions are likely to have died due to serious viruses.
Forest Department officials want to suppress the case.
The corrupt officials of the forest department may try to cover this incident, even though there are some dutiful officers and employees too, who want to bring open the responsible forest department in this incident.
However, these officers are kept away from the case.
A virus entered the lions due to eating dead animals: forest officials
A forest official on the condition of anonymity said that 7 lions' deaths are being shown as the in-fighting, while 16 others have died due to the virus.
The lions who died due to the virus had consumed dead animals at Sarsiya Vidi.
By the time the forest department was informed of this incident, the lions had already caught this virus.
However, it is difficult to determine how many lions ate this meat.
Know more about the details of how the virus spread and how the bones of dead animals were removed.
To save the lions, CDV antiviral vaccine was sent to the Rajkot from the US, it was then sent to Junagadh.
Until the CBI or CID investigate, the truth won't be exposed.
When the team from Delhi came, the bones of the dead animals were removed.
At present, 30 lions have been caught and kept at Jasadhar Animal Care, and this incident is being diversified.
The official further said that when the team of Delhi and Dehradun came to the spot, to cover the incident, a truck load of the bones of dead animals, near Pavna Chakki, was removed from the area.
This work was done by the interstate laborers so that no one can knew about it. The fact is that the forest department is responsible somewhere behind this lions' deaths.
We won't know the truth till the CBI or the CID investigation is done. A division official on condition of anonymity said that 28 days ago, at Pawanchalkki in Sarsiya Vidi, 14 dead diseased goats from Virpur village, 2 diseased cows of Govindpur and 1 buffalo infected with rabies from some village was placed here.
In the dead lions, the virus was ingested by eating dead cattle in n Sarsiya Vidi.
After eating dogs or other carnivorous animals, the virus spreads.
It is true that this virus has spread after eating dog or other carnivorous animals, but in the sunlight, the saliva bacteria of the animal disappears only in seconds in the meat consumed by dogs or other animals.
If a rogue dog has eaten a dead animal and a lion or a wild animal eat the same animal, this virus enters the lion or wild animal's body directly.
Ajab-Gajab Desk:- A couple in the Philippines was shocked when they saw their new born child, because the baby was born without a face.
This is due to a rare type of physical disorder, which occurs to approximately one in 20,000.
The child's parents say that this has happened due to the side effects of a drug.
Knowing about the child, the father was in trauma, while the mother had lost consciousness.
Doctors did not expect that the child would live longer, although after all the problems, the child is still alive and recently they celebrated his first birthday.
This is a story of Matthew Gillado, the one-year-old son of Raven and his wife Isabel, who live in the Philippines.
He was born last year without a face.
It was due to a rare type of physical disorder.
Due to this illness, during pregnancy, the cranial vault bone lying in the skull did not form and his face could not form.
After that, his face looks as if a bomb has exploded within his head.
In July last year, when the child's mother, Isabel Gilado, went for the first ultrasound, after seeing the report, doctors thought that the unborn baby was less likely to survive.
However, despite all the problems and the doubts of the doctors, he was born on 3rd October last year.
According to the couple, Isabel had a fever in the first month of pregnancy.
After that, she took a medicine called Bioflu for a week.
Which is made up of phenylphrine HCI, chlorphaminamine and paracetamol.
The parents think that this drug might have spoiled the face of the child.
Because the face is not in a proper shape, there are a lot of problems in feeding the baby..
He has to be fed drops of milk.
Also, it is necessary to give vitamin supplements to keep him healthy.
The father was frightened after seeing the face of the child.
Matthew was born in a Santiago hospital through an operation.
The child's father says, "When I first saw our baby, I was frightened, I began to feel weak and almost fell in the delivery room."
He did not have any face.
Even after being born in this situation, Matthew was discharged from the hospital the next day while his mother Isabel had to stay in ICU for two weeks.
Raven says that we physically wanted to touch our baby, we wanted to kiss and hug it, so we named it Matthew.
Which means "A gift received from God".
The financial condition of the child's father is not very good.
He works in a clothing factory in Quezon City and earns about 9 thousand rupees a month.
Because of low earnings, Raven has to seek help from relatives and others to meet Matthew's needs.
In May this year, Matthew was taken to a better hospital in Manila, where he remained admitted for approximately 3 weeks.
During this time, after many tests, the doctors refused to do the surgery.
They said that because of his weight being only 4.9 kg, his delicate constitution would not tolerate such major surgical operation.
Doctors might have said anything, but the child's mother Isabel has not given up.
She is confident that one day Matthew will be okay.
Isabel says, "He is fighting for his life and we have also not lost hope."
We are fighting and we are confident that one day, with God's grace and advanced medical assistance, I will see him with a good face.

Lions living in Gir forest
When we are discussing the untimely deaths of the Gir lions,
I remember this poetry of Shree Zaverchand Meghani...
Vanravan no savaj garje, gir kanthano kesri garje, mon fadi matelo garje jane ko jogander garje but it seems that these words have competely changed...
Whose self-interest?
Yes, whose selfish need was behind all this?
Tourists need selfies, guides want rupees, government officials need their jobs and the hunters want the goats..whole government looked after each other's interest. How ever will the lion ever roar in this?
Whose needs?
(Whose needs were met? Can you think....)
Due to the cost of office expenses, the budget in books, a party in picnics, pompous leaders, and their egos, these lions turned to show-pieces...
(Meghani sir's poetry talked about who were afraid of lions...but here?)
Scared of sickness, scared of unknown diseases, scared of virus, the lions get scared! ***
Ankh jhabuke...!
(In the original poetry how lion's eyes shine that is described. But here it is different...)
Camera's eyes shine, flashlight's eyes shine, as the news breaks, the media's eyes shine and what about the sleeping editor?
Ankh jhabuke...!
Woke up suddenly?
(Now the game of blaming each-other starts!
And the song changes...)

Antonin Scalia 'wouldn't be terribly surprised' by 'Mad Libs protesting' on Kavanaugh, son says
The son of late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father wouldn't have been shocked by the partisan conflagration surrounding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, owing to what he called the improperly outsized power of the Supreme Court in modern life.
"On a general level, he wouldn't be terribly surprised about the intensity surrounding this Supreme Court nomination, because so much of it comes down to Roe v. Wade -- at least, that's how the left is presenting it," Christopher Scalia said, referring to the landmark 1973 case holding that women have a constitutional right to an abortion within certain trimesters.
In one fell swoop, Roe effectively prevented states from deciding on their own how to regulate abortion, and several states immediately took steps to try to restrict abortion rights in response.
"My father often said, with Roe v. Wade in particular but other cases as well, the court was really trying to come in and settle a cultural issue that should have been resolved in elections, and the legislative process," he added during his appearance on "Fox & Friends."
"By trying to short-circuit that process, the Supreme Court caused more damage and, as a result, Supreme Court nominations and confirmation battles have become more heated, because justices have taken on the role that properly belongs to legislators."
Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse made a similar point during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings earlier this month, when he reiterated that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies and improperly leaves the resulting bureaucratic uncertainties to the Supreme Court to resolve -- effectively making the justices supplemental legislators doing a job abdicated by senators.
Hundreds of protesters were arrested and charged by Capitol Hill police for improperly interfering with those confirmation proceedings.
Asked whether Kavanaugh had any chance of avoiding that kind of backlash -- which now centers primarily on uncorroborated allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct decades ago -- Scalia said there was likely no avoiding the uproar.
Responding to claims that Kavanaugh shouldn't serve on the Supreme Court because of his fiery and, at times, defiant behavior during questioning about the lurid allegations against him by senators on Thursday, Scalia suggested justices don't always have calm temperaments.
"It's really not all that rare for justices to get angry," Scalia said, referencing sometimes-heated dissents in hot-button cases.
"It's true that judge Kavanaugh was perhaps more aggressive, but that's because the circumstances were a lot different.
He was defending his good name from uncorroborated accusations."
Kavanaugh on Thursday received the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by a party-line 11-10 vote, to advance to a full Senate floor vote.
In a dramatic moment, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he would provide his crucial swing vote in favor of Kavanaugh only if the FBI were given a one-week period in which to investigate current and credible misconduct claims against Kavanaugh.
That investigation is ongoing, and President Trump has said the agency has broad authority in the probe to interview "whoever" it wants.
In Gujarat and other states, during the seventh phase of the voting, a case is filed against Modi on displaying the lotus mark.
After the incident, congress has spoken of taking the case further.

On Wednesday in Gujarat, after voting, Narendra Modi had addressed the media by showing the party's election symbol.
Congress had complained to the Election Commission regarding this matter.
After considering the matter, the commission considered the complaint as genuine.
However, Modi addressed a rally recently and said "if I have shown the symbol, what is wrong with that?
The truth is that congress is scared and hence attacking me.

Air India's worry increased, pilots threatened to strike.
Facing the cash issue, Air India's trouble is not going to diminish soon.
According to the news, the company's Regional Pilot Unit has threatened to go on strike.
The Unit said that if the wages were delayed, they would stop co-operating with the management.
It has created a bad impact on the staff's daily life.
In a letter to the Central Executive Committee of Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ISPA), the Regional Executive (REC) said that until the payrolls are on time, non-cooperation will continue.
Let us not forget that the company has delayed eleven thousand employees’ salaries for the third month in a row.
The letter mentions that the REC meeting in Delhi was held on June 6.
Late payment has badly impacted the day-to-day life of the entire staff.
Those who have taken loans are under pressure as the financial institutions demand installment.
They have to wait until 15th June for the salary.
Air India employees will have to wait until 15th June for the salary of May.
Air India officially stated that they are late in the payment of May month and there is a possibility to make the payment by June 15.
This is the third consecutive month when the airline is late in paying salaries.
Earlier, the salary of March and April was not given on time.
Air India employees usually get salaries on the 30th and the 31st of every month.
Fantastical frocks rule in off-the-peg Schiaparelli range
Can you make surrealism real?
That is the question for the house of Schiaparelli.
The Paris couture house founded by Elsa Schiaparelli almost a century ago has launched its first collection of ready-to-wear clothes and handbags.
For a label that has always celebrated the fantastical rather than the wearable, it is a concept almost as far fetched as Elsa Schiaparelli's famous hat in the shape of an upturned shoe.
Yet despite its long history of eccentricity, there is something very modern about this fashion house.
The aesthetic is emoji-like, all lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli designed the first jumpsuit, in 1930, and was the first designer to set a catwalk show to music.
It was Schiaparelli and her friend Salvador Dalí who invented the art-fashion collaboration, as currently espoused at Calvin Klein and Raf Simons with US artist Sterling Ruby.
Legend has it that Dali wanted the lobster-embroidered evening gown he and Schiaparelli created to be displayed in the salon with a dressing of real mayonnaise, but he was overruled.

"We wanted to revisit this idea of collaboration, which is such a part of Schiaparelli history" said Bertrand Guyon, creative director for the past three years, speaking at the house's salon in Place Vendôme.
For the ready-to-wear collection, he took as a starting point Schiaparelli's friendship with Man Ray and created clothes based on iconic artworks, in partnership with the Man Ray Foundation.
Glass Tears, the artist's famous close up of a pair of eyes, appears on a white T-shirt studded with Perspex teardrops, while the floating red lips from Observatory Time: The Lovers appear on a collaged, silk-screen shift dress.
Man Ray's Glass Tears appears on a T-shirt from the collection.
One of Elsa's quirks was a superstitious devotion to the letter S. Shocking pink, her signature colour, inspired her perfume, Shocking.
The first Schiaparelli handbag, designed by Guyon with a keyhole design on the clasp, is called Secret.
It will retail at the fantastical price of £5,000.
The surreal side of Paris fashion week was also on display yesterday at a pop-up shop in a warehouse on the left bank of the Seine, selling €100 rugs from Virgil Abloh's soon-to-be released collection for Ikea.
Half an hour before the opening time, a 500-strong queue of Abloh's young fans stretched along the quai, excited by the prospect of buying one of his designs without the price tags that come with his Louis Vuitton menswear.
For Abloh, the project keeps communication channels open with a broader audience than can afford luxury fashion or designer furniture.
"No one owns anything any more, but if you have knowledge of a certain chair, then it is part of your dinner conversation.
That is the millennials" train of thought," he said recently.
By the time models began zooming past the audience on skateboards in a garage in the Marais, it was clear that this was not a day for ordinary catwalk shows.
Andreas Kronthaler, Vivienne Westwood's husband and a designer in his own right, took Jessica Fulford-Dobson's portraits of female skateboarders in Kabul as a starting point for a collection that saw men and women in colourful loose robes.
Some women - and a few men - skated in heeled mule sandals, although those in vertiginous platform boots stayed on foot.
Westwood, who watched from the front row in a horse-print dress from the collection and an orange cardigan tied around her waist, joined her husband on the catwalk for his final bow, where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers.
The powerful connections of twins - in pictures
Detroit-born, London-based photographer Peter Zelewski built a career in street photography before turning his attention to twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and as a human being, I've always been fascinated by twins, by that incredible bond we hear about," he says.
It was never intended as a full project, but "once I took my portrait of the first set of twins it was a massive addiction and there was no going back."
Zelewski's forthcoming book, Twins, features the images and stories of 44 sets of identical twins.
The project is primarily a visual one, he says: "It's not a documentary or scientific project - my main goal was to make powerful, emotive portraits of people."
Nurses pass vote of no confidence in union over pay deal handling
Royal College of Nursing members angry with their union's handling of changes to the NHS pay deal have voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the organisation in a unprecedented move amid accusations it had misrepresented expected pay increases.
It came after a protracted saga within the RCN after its former general secretary Janet Davies admitted it had wrongly told members they would all be in line for an immediate 3% pay increase this year following the end of the 1% pay cap.
Members were frustrated after many did not receive expected rises in pay, forcing Davies to step down amid pressure from members, which led to the no-confidence vote in the college's council at an emergency general meeting in Birmingham on Friday following a petition.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has cleared the air and the college will emerge stronger as a result," the RCN chair, Maria Trewern, said.
"This vote is clear and the council and management of the RCN have received the message.
Council has already driven change within the organisation in recent weeks - to listen more closely to members and involve them thoroughly - and this will continue."
A meeting will take place next week and it is expected that members of the RCN council will step down.
"Nursing is based on trust," an NHS nurse told the Guardian.
"The actions of the RCN council have destroyed the trust that we had in them and they must go.
I hope they will do the honourable thing and comply with request.
I await with interest to see if the members of other unions seek the same redress."
Rachel Harrison, the GMB national officer for the NHS, told the Guardian in August: "Up and down the country, NHS staff have opened their pay cheques and realised it's not the pay rise they thought they were going to get.
And they are angry."
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the RCN conceded that it made a number of mistakes in its processes around the 2018 pay deal and its communication.
However, it stated that the RCN's "Scrap the Cap" campaign forced the government to end the pay cap with a phased pay rise worth 6.5% now set to be introduced over three years.
The vote came after an independent report found that the RCN's presentation of the deal was biased towards its acceptance, while Davies was accused of "closing down" scrutiny of the deal.
It is claimed that the RCN presented "factually incorrect" information, meaning that members were not able to make an informed judgment on the deal, while alternative options were not explored.
The RCN published contradictory information on whether the 3% rise would apply for all members.
In a separate briefing before the RCN's congress, representatives were incorrectly told there would be a "3% increase, plus an increase from incremental reform."
In fact, the 3% increase included the incremental rises and, in any case, only certain workers at the top of their pay band would receive that rise immediately.
"The majority of information conveyed to members about the implementation of the deal after congress was inaccurate (probably a result of an attempt to simplify the message)," a spokesperson from the Electoral Reform Services, who conducted the report, said.
"ERS believes that failure to inform decision makers of information that compared the current system with the proposed deal in a clear succinct manner, hindered informed balanced judgment as it failed to provide clear context to the headline gains, including the 6.5% and 29% figures used in during the campaign."
The motion of no confidence passed with 78% in favour on a turnout of 3.74% of RCN members.
Lindsay Lohan disturbs Instagram Live viewers as she tries to 'kidnap' family's children on the street
Lindsay Lohan is facing criticism after posting a live video on Instagram in which she follows a homeless family down the street, trying to separate the sons from their parents.
Possibly shot in Moscow (based on previous Instagram Story updates from Lohan) the Live video starts with the actor offering to put a roof over the family's head for the night, but the situation soon becomes fraught.
"Hey everyone, I just want to show you a family that I met," she tells viewers, "a Syrian refugee family that I'm really worried about.
They really need help.
You want to come with me?
Come with me, I'll take care of you guys," she says to the family, before turning to one of the children: "Do you want to stay in a hotel tonight?
Do you want to watch movies?
It would be so cool to watch a movie on a TV or a computer."
When the parents refuse, Lohan becomes confrontational.
"You should not have them your sons on the floor, you should be a hard-working woman and you should be doing what you can for your children, so they have a better life," she says.
"If someone is offering them a home and a bed, which is me at the moment, give it to them.
They will come back to you.
I won't leave until I take you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't f*** with me."
When the family attempt to evade Lohan by walking off down the street, she follows them, still broadcasting on Instagram Live.
"Look what's happening, they're trafficking children. You're ruining Arabic culture by doing this."
"You're taking these children, they want to go.
I'm with you boys, don't worry, the whole world is seeing this right now."
The situation gets physical towards the end of the video, with the mother appearing to strike Lohan.
Clips from the video have begun circulating on social media, with several users suggesting that the incident amounts to an attempted kidnapping.
The Independent has contacted a representative for Lohan for comment.
Third of Britons believe they will never clear their debts
Almost a third of British people believe they will never clear their debts in their lifetimes and more than one in 10 say they won't even be able to reduce their debt levels.
Research by Equifax and Gorkana, seen exclusively by The Independent, reveals that people aged between 18 and 24, in particular, believe they face a lifetime of debt, with just half saying they expect to ever be able get back into the black.
Students graduate with an average debt of £46,000, according to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report out last year, and students from the poorest backgrounds graduate with debts of more than £57,000.
In fact, the vast majority of graduates - 81 per cent - will never clear their debt in full, which means they'll spend the first 30 years of their working lives with a debt hanging over them.
Debt levels across society are rising; figures from the Office for National Statistics show that household debt in the UK is at a record high, with Britons spending an average of £900 more than they earn each year.
But just how worried should we be about this flurry of depression-inducing stats?
Is a lifelong relationship with debt simply the new normal - not just for younger adults, but for the entire population?
Take cars, for example - often the biggest purchase we'll make after buying (if we're lucky) a home.
This week, Auto Trader predicted that within a decade all new cars will be bought on finance as the way we expect to pay for our motoring changes.
Jeannie Boyle, director and chartered financial planner at EQ Investors, certainly believes there has been a shift in expectation.
"Debt is definitely more normal now - credit cards are more prevalent, and so are zero per cent balance transfers, student loans and pay day lenders," she says.
"For our grandparents' generation it was shameful to be in debt."
In recent times, student debt and house prices have normalised debt.
Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, agrees and says the result could be worrying.
"If you're having to borrow four to five times your income to buy a property, an enormous sum in itself, adding some more debt to that may not seem like such a big deal," she explains.
And that is where people are going to get into trouble.
Interest rates have been very low for many years and people with big mortgages or other debts should be aware that they need to factor in a cushion for when rates rise.
Perhaps understandably, commentators from the finance industry seem confident.
Brian Brodie, chief executive of the loans agency Freedom Finance, says: "Debt isn't a dirty word."
Whether financing home improvements or purchasing a new car, taking out a loan is no longer seen as the "last resort."
Low interest rates have driven many people to lock their savings away in fixed-term accounts that offer higher returns, but reduced access to savings.
As a result, "middle class" borrowing is on the rise.
In the last six months, around half of our new loans were taken out by customers with an "excellent" credit rating.
For Richard Haymes, head of financial difficulties at Equifax company TDX Group, this expectation of a lifetime of debt is a clear concern.
He says: "With inflation hitting a six-month high in August (2.7 per cent), a recent interest rate rise and limited wage growth, it's disconcerting that a large proportion of people are taking on debt without a realistic expectation of being able to pay it back."
According to our analysis, personal insolvencies are set to grow by 17 per cent this year, and the main contributing factor is record levels of consumer borrowing.
Debt might be manageable while people work and earn but there's concern about what a lifetime in debt might mean for our old-age wellbeing.
Research carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with equity release specialist More 2 Life shows that unsecured debt among 55- to 74-year-olds has risen by more than a third over the last four years, more than twice as fast as the national average.
And the most common form of debt for this age group is credit cards, with 30 per cent spending more than they pay off each month.
Boyle adds: "We're increasingly seeing people using pension freedoms to pay off debt when they turn 55, which has an impact on their wellbeing in retirement.
This is often the only savings they've effectively been "forced" to make.
People also think they will use equity in their property to pay it off later - but this is problematic as downsizing does not always release as much money as expected.
Any future drop in property process will exacerbate this.
Serena Williams sings 'I Touch Myself' topless to raise breast cancer awareness
Serena Williams has released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" while covering her bare chest with her hands.
The tennis pro shared the clip on her Instagram page, explaining that she created the video to encourage women to self-check their breasts.
"This Breast Cancer Awareness Month I've recorded a version of The Divinyls global hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to self-check regularly," Williams wrote.
"Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it's an issue that affects all women of all colours, all around the world.
Early detection is key - it saves so many lives.
I just hope this helps to remind women of that."
Williams continued: "The music video is part of the "I Touch Myself Project" which was created in honour of celebrated diva, Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer, and who gave us her hit song to remind women to put their health first."
The project, which is supported by lingerie brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), first launched in 2014 following the passing of Amphlett at the age of 53.
Since posting the video on her Instagram account, it has been viewed more than 1.5 million times with legions of fans praising the tennis superstar for performing the song.
"So much love for this and what you did, putting yourself out there.
Thank you Serena," one person wrote.
Another added: "I LOVE this, Serena.
I'm a breast cancer survivor of 20 years and I found the lump myself on self-exam even after mammograms showed nothing.
Exams are so so important.
Thank you for putting yourself out of your comfort zone - you are a goddess!"
As part of the "I Touch Myself Project," Berlei is also releasing a new snakeskin print, rock star inspired bra called The Chrissy.
100 per cent of the profits from the bra will be donated to BCNA.
When self-checking, it is important to know the signs and symptoms you should be looking for.
As well as lumps, other signs of breast cancer include a change in breast size or shape, a rash or skin sores, nipple discharge, skin indentation, constant pain or a change in skin texture.
Similarly, swelling around the armpit or collarbone could be an indicator, as can a growing vein or inverted nipple.
Women are advised to check their breasts each month.
If you notice any symptoms of breast cancer, the NHS advises that you see your GP as soon as possible.
After examination, your GP will then refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic if they feel your symptoms need further assessment.
Adam Driver is so good in this SNL skit that the cast can't keep a straight face
Adam Driver was the guest host of Saturday Night Live this week, and he really gave 110%.
The show's funniest sketches always tend to be the ones that aren't pegged to a specific current event, and so was the case with new skit "Career Day."
It centres on a "bring your father to work" day at an American high school, where teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees to let his elderly oil baron father, Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), give a talk.
Hobbling in on a cane, Parnassus proceeds to deliver a blistering account of his domination of the oil industry, a megalomaniac likely inspired in part by the Daniel Day-Lewis "There Will Be Blood" character Daniel Plainview.
"I was born seven months too early," Parnassus tells the students.
"Incubation technology was still in its infancy, so they placed me in a cast iron pot inside a pizza oven until I was ripe enough to walk.
My bones never hardened but my spirit did.
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson, along with fellow SNL cast member Aidy Bryant who plays the schoolteacher, struggle to keep straight faces and are largely unable to look Driver in the eye.
The Star Wars actor is in full force however, growing increasingly belligerent as he recalls his personal war with oil baron rival HR Pickins.
"I married your granddaughter!" he spits.
"Filled her belly with my festering seed and soiled your boy, he is my final revenge HR!"
In under five minutes, Parnassus became as enthralling an Adam Driver character as Kylo Ren did in two feature films.
"Curse you, HR!"
Kendrick Lamar leak: Eight unheard songs surface online
Kendrick Lamar appears to have been the victim of a sizeable leak of unreleased songs.
Eight never-before-heard tracks hit the internet overnight on Saturday, featuring guest verses from SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul.
It is unclear where they stem from, and neither the nickname the collection is being circulated under, "Bad Kid Chill City EP," nor the artwork (which seems to have been created by a fan) are official.
The tracks, which may be demos and only half-finished, sound as though they were recorded during different parts of Lamar's career.
"Gang Member" would seem to be of Good Kid Maad City era, while "Heroin" featuring SZA sounds closer to DAMN./Black Panther soundtrack.
The tracks being passed around as a collection are as follows:
Gang Member
The Only Nigga
Want In Life
Loved Ones (featuring SZA)
Own This City
Heroin (featuring SZA, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad, & Ab Soul
Look Over Your Shoulders (featuring Busta Rhymes & Michael Jackson)
Swimming Pools Alternate
The Independent has contacted a representative for Kendrick Lamar for comment.
Three People Missing After Crash in Lituya Bay, North of Juneau
A search was underway on Saturday for three people missing after a helicopter crash north of Juneau, Alaska.
One person was rescued after the crash on Friday, but three others were unaccounted for.
The helicopter crashed near Lituya Bay, northwest of Juneau.
The helicopter was identified as an Airbus H125, on a long distance trip out of Grand Prairie, Texas.
Debris from the aircraft was found 100 feet from the shore on Friday.
The one person rescued was identified as a 14-year-old, the Associated Press reported.
The survivor was reported to have mild hypothermia but was otherwise okay.
There were two adults and two adolescents on the helicopter when it went down.
The missing were identified as David King, 53; Josh Pepperd, 42; and Andrew Pepperd, 11, according to KTVA.
The elder Pepperd was identified as the president of Alaska based construction firm Davis Constructors & Engineers.
It was not clear what caused the crash.
The National Transportation Safety Board said it an investigation was underway.
"Two adults and two adolescents were aboard the crashed helicopter that was reported to be brand new out of the factory," Coast Guard officials said in a statement, according to KTVA.
The pilot is reported to have 40 years flying experiencing including Alaska flight time in both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.
Family friend Jeff Brodsky said loved ones were "holding onto hope that a miracle will happen," according to the Anchorage Daily News.
Rescuers resume a search with help from a Coastguard helicopter for two experienced climbers missing on Ben Nevis on February 17, 2016, in Fort William, Scotland.
A search was underway on Saturday for three people missing after a helicopter crash in Alaska.
'I'm A Victim of Sexual Assault'
Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said Sunday morning that she is a victim of sexual assault.
Conway responded to the intense exchanges during the past week's testimonies from Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
In response, Conway emotionally declared she herself is a victim of sexual assault in the past and defended Kavanaugh to host Jake Tapper, saying she believes sexual assault accusations against him were "cherry-picked."
"I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.
I'm a victim of sexual assault," Conway told CNN's "State of the Union" program Sunday.
"I'm a victim of sexual assault, I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh or Take Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to be held responsible for that.
You have to be responsible for your own conduct."
Conway blasted the network as a "disgrace" for comparing the accusations made against Kavanaugh to those directed at Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in Pennsylvania state prison last week.
Conway also railed against the Senate Judiciary Committee's inability to remove former President Bill Clinton from office despite having oral sex in the Oval Office and "lying about it" directly to the American people.
Kavanaugh And Ford Testimonies Have Divided America, Poll Shows
Americas are at odds over the testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who claims the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers.
And the number of people who believed Ford or Kavanaugh were lying was similar, with 38 percent saying they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while a smaller 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both parties after Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein detailing her allegation against the judge.
When the letter was made publi,c both Ford and Kavanaugh said they would be prepared to speak before the committee.
During her testimony, Ford said she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was the person who had attempted to assault her at a house party in the early 1980s dismissing the idea that there could be a case of mistaken identity.
In an emotional opening statement the 51-year-old said she had felt it was her civic duty to come forward.
"I am terrified," she said.
"I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."
Kavanaugh, who denied the allegations made by Ford, as well as by two other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, said he had "never sexually assaulted anyone - not in high school, not in college, not ever."
"There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything - no matter how far-fetched or odious, that will block a vote of my nomination," he said.
"These are last minute smears, pure and simple."
Unsurprisingly, the results of the YouGov poll, which surveyed 2,607 people from 27-28 September were split on party lines, with Democrats far more likely to believe Ford (73 percent) and Republicans more likely to believe Kavanaugh (74 percent,) although more Republicans believed Ford than Democrats did Kavanaugh (14 percent compared with 11 percent.)
Body Worlds Founder, Known As "Dr Death," Wants To Be Cut Up And Put In His Own Show
The German scientist who invented plastination wants to be a permanent part of his Body Worlds exhibition after he dies.
Gunther von Hagens came up with the pioneering technique, which allowed the display of cadavers, skulls and organs in exhibitions that have gone around the world and sparked amazement as well as controversy.
Now terminally ill with cancer, the 73-year-old has instructed his wife to plastinate him after his death so that he become a permanent fixture in the Body Worlds exhibition which opens to the public this week in London.
It's somehow finalising his life's work.
I understand now that it's more an appreciation and an expression of love for me to do it," Angelina Whalley told The Observer.
She said that her husband has issued strict instructions on what to do with his corpse in a process that takes about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries need to be unwound, the body will be injected with silicone and then put in a pose.
"He said to me: "Angelina, you are entitled to freeze me down to -25 Celsius for one year, but after that time you really need to put your hands on me because otherwise I will get freeze burn.""
So I have one year for mourning and then I will have to do it."
Then, ideally wearing his trademark fedora hat, he will join the exhibition in the London Pavilion, with other bodies frozen in time and erected in poses like riding a horse or playing cards.
Von Hagens rose to fame in the UK when he performed a live autopsy on British television, the first public autopsy for 170 years.
More than 47 million people have visited versions of Body Worlds around the world since 1995.
Founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernal, told The Guardian that the 28,000 square foot exhibition space was based on 100% donations from people who "have given consent in order to help and educate the living, to help people see what can go wrong.
We see and read so many horrible things that it makes us scared of death.
We are all going there, that's what we have in common, we are all going to die and I think Body Worlds shows us that you don't have to be afraid," Tabernal said.
Ronaldo's Lawyers Threaten Lawsuit Over Rape Accusation
Lawyers for the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said Friday that they would sue a German magazine after it had published what they called "blatantly illegal" accusations by an American woman who says she was raped by Ronaldo in 2009.
One of Ronaldo's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the report in the magazine, Der Spiegel, was "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy" and that he would seek legal redress for his client from the magazine.
The statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo's agent, the firm Gestifute, in response to a request for comment on Der Spiegel's article, which was published online Friday.
Gestifute did not answer any specific questions about the content of Der Spiegel's report, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.
Der Spiegel first reported on the allegation in April 2017.
Ronaldo, one of the biggest names in world sports, is a five-time world player of the year.
He transferred to Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid this summer; the Italian club declined to comment on Der Spiegel's report.
The magazine said the suspected rape took place in June 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas, according to Leslie Mark Stovall, the lawyer for the woman who made the accusation, Kathryn Mayorga.
Ronaldo and Mayorga then reached an out-of-court settlement, according to Stovall and the magazine.
In it, Mayorga agreed to a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a $375,000 payment from Ronaldo.
Stovall did not immediately respond to email requests from Reuters for comment on the article, and Mayorga did not answer telephone calls to her home.
Stovall told Der Spiegel, however, that he had filed a civil complaint seeking to declare the nondisclosure agreement void.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel she no longer felt bound by the agreement as she suffers from the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I've had like these serious breakdowns," she told Der Spiegel.
"And again, blaming of the rape.
And I blame him, and I blame myself for signing that thing."
Independence Through Sustainable Author Businesses
Are you ready for self-publishing 3.0?
In a new white paper released today on #selfpub3.0, the Alliance of Independent Authors details how, for the first time, authors can now join the ranks of other creative entrepreneurs in growing their independence and building sustainable author businesses.
Orna Ross, founder of the Alliance of Independent Authors and repeatedly named "One of the 100 Most Influential People in Publishing," will explain why and how authors should embrace self-publishing 3.0 at Digital Book World 2018.
"Consumer trends like the rise of personal branding, mindful consumption and mobile phone reading are combining with digital publishing tech to create more favorable conditions than ever before for author-businesses," says Ross.
But only authors who have developed an independent, creative and empowered mindset, who understand the value of their intellectual property, can benefit from these opportunities.
#selfpub3.0 encourages authors to ensure we have a diversity of earning streams through our own websites, which become the hub of our successful publishing and media enterprises.
Income streams might include direct sales, subscription models, crowdsourced patronage, wide distribution models and other income streams like online teaching and affiliate income.
#selfpub3.0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books as widely as possible, in as many formats as possible.
Mostly, #selfpub3.0 is about the shift in mindset needed to take control of your author business rather than unthinkingly assigning all your intellectual property, your most valuable creative asset, to a business owned by another, whether that is a trade-publisher or self-publishing service.
These are the steps that maximize income, impact, and influence for authors and should be of interest to every author and publisher working in the digital age, Ross says, pointing out that true independence, for authors as for anyone, must be rooted in commercial as well as creative independence.
This is the future, now.
And it has never been so bright for independent authors.
Self-Publishing 1.0 was desktop publishing and print on demand.
Self-Publishing 2.0 was selling e-books for e-readers and phones via online bookstores.
Now we're entering the era of self-publishing 3.0: self-publishers building viable and sustainable author enterprises.
The Alliance of Independent Authors is the only global, non-profit association for self-publishing writers.

Italy president, central banker warn government over deficit plan
Italy's president and its central bank governor on Saturday warned that the country's debt must remain sustainable after the populist government unveiled plans to significantly raise deficit spending next year.
Late on Thursday, the ruling parties - made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - proposed a 2019 deficit that is, at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), three times the previous administration's target.
The announcement rattled markets on Friday, prompting a sell-off of bonds and a rout of banking stocks.
It also set up a clash with the European Commission, which monitors and enforces EU fiscal rules.
President Sergio Mattarella, addressing a group at the presidential palace that had marked the 70th anniversary of the constitution, noted that the state's founding law requires "balanced budgets and the sustainability of debt."
"This is to protect the savings of our fellow citizens," he said.
A little later at a conference in central Italy, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said the country's debt, the largest among big European Union economies at 131 percent of GDP, must not be allowed to increase.
"Italy needs to favor public and private investment and to contain and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to Ansa state news agency.
"The debt must be "put on downward path," he added.
Matteo Salvini, leader of the League and also a deputy prime minister, responded to Mattarella by saying that years of Brussels-imposed austerity had driven up debt.
"Be calm Mr. President," Salvini said in a statement.
"Years of budgets imposed by Europe have made our public debt explode. Finally we are changing course and betting on the future and on growth."
Earlier, before either Mattarella or Visco spoke, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the budget would "repay the people for the thieving of the past," though he added the government's intention was not to challenge the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pushed Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is an economist unaffiliated with either group, to sign off on their plans to hike deficit spending.
Italian media said Mattarella had supported Tria's failed effort to keep the deficit target below 2 percent of GDP.
The president and the central banker have no direct role in making economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject a law and send it back to parliament, but he can do so only once.
Parliament can then pass it again, unchanged, and he must sign it into law.
Indonesia tsunami sensors missed huge waves: official
Indonesia's geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning 34 minutes after it was first issued following a major earthquake that sent huge waves crashing into the northeastern coast of Sulawesi island, killing hundreds and leaving thousands more homeless.
The ruins of cars as seen after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.
The 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami, which hit the city of Palu about 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta and further along the coastline, killed at least 384 people.
Officials said on Saturday the death toll was likely to rise.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their death.
The geophysics agency (BMKG) faced criticism on Saturday on social media, with many questioning if the tsunami warning was lifted too soon.
The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to "end" the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
"We have no observation data at Palu.
So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that," said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami center at BMKG.
He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in sea level, only recorded an "insignificant," six-centimeter (2.5 inches) wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu.
"If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better.
This is something we must evaluate for the future," said Triyono.
It was not clear whether the tsunami, which officials say hammered Palu and the surrounding area at extremely high speeds measuring in the hundreds of kilometers per hour, occurred before or after the warning had been lifted.
Resident checks dead bodies to find their family at a street after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.
"Based on the videos circulating on social media, we estimate the tsunami happened before the warning officially ended," Triyono said.
The most devastating came on Boxing Day in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including over 126,000 in Indonesia.
The scenic town of Palu sits at the mouth of a narrow bay in northeastern Sulawesi and is home to around 380,000 people.
It was hit by a tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB).
Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at University of Oxford, said it was "surprising" the quake had generated a tsunami.
Friday's quake was recorded as a "strike-slip" event where neighboring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami.
"There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami," he said, adding the narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster agency, told reporters his team had been "preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand" when the tsunami warning was "suddenly ended."
The communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Nugroho said the quake had brought down the area's power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast.
Indonesians took to social media to question the BMKG's move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner.
"So upset.. the warning was lifted.. although a tsunami happened..." said one Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: 'Mollywood' duo on course to smash box office records
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood won their foursomes on Saturday to become the first European duo to sweep all four pairs matches and are on course for even more history as Europe take a 10-6 lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
After thumping Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau 5&4 they became the first-ever European pairing to win all four of their matches.
Only Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins, in 1979, have ever managed it for the Americans.
The crushing winning margins - 3&1, 5&4, 4&3 and 5&4 - tell only half the story.
Left in their dust was a battered Woods, the 14-times major winner being drubbed three times, with Patrick Reed brushed aside twice.
The other win came against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the form pairing of the U.S. team this week who won their other three games.
Molinari and Fleetwood go into Sunday's singles with the chance to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five.
Fleetwood has already claimed the most points in a single Ryder Cup by a European rookie.
Dubbed "Mollywood" by their newly-acquired army of fans, at first glance the pair might have looked unlikely contenders to lead the European charge.
Ryder Cup first-timers such as Fleetwood are not supposed to perform like this, while Molinari had failed to win any of his six previous matches, losing four of them.
However, a more positive view was that Fleetwood was European number one last year, knows the Le Golf National course inside out having won the French Open here in 2017, and showed his big-match temperament by finishing second in this year's U.S. Open.
Molinari is the freshly-minted British Open champion and widely regarded as the most consistent ball-striker on the European Tour - an attribute that has paid huge dividends on the tight course where finding the rough, as the Americans all-too-often did, was a recipe for disaster.
Those pedigrees, combined with what looked like a great on-course chemistry, proved an irresistible force.
"I feel a little bit emotional now and we're only on Saturday," said the famously laid-back Fleetwood, who has played all weekend with a huge smile on his face.
We were really good this afternoon, really solid and played really well.
To have your own piece of history together is really special.
I'm just glad we've done our job for the team."
Molinari was equally delighted.
"Playing alongside Tommy, it's been amazing," he said.
"But we've come to do a job, not to go in the record books, those 4-1/2 points we'll need tomorrow for the overall victory we will have to fight hard for; it's not going to be easy."
Knight fever!
Irish village transformed into medieval battlefield
Once the chief fortress of a powerful 15th century family descended from an English knight, the west of Ireland castle of Claregalway went back to its roots on Saturday.
Knights duel with swords during a medieval combat festival at Claregalway castle in Galway, Ireland September 29, 2018.
The grounds of the fully restored Anglo-Norman era tower house were transformed into a medieval battlefield as hundreds of enthusiastic visitors, many from around the world, re-enacted full contact combat and games from centuries ago.
Karl Dornan in costume as a Knight and Donna Dornan in costume as a Celtic warrior patrol the great hall of Claregalway Castle during a medieval combat festival in Galway, Ireland September 29, 2018.
"It's a nice weekend away and it's something different," said Denise Fitzgerald from County Kerry, who as the tavern owner for the weekend prepared food for the competitors by frying vegetables off in lard on a campfire.
"For me it's like getting back to basics.
I've been trying to do everything properly," said the theater worker, who was taking part in her first armored combat festival.
On the field, fighters dressed head to toe in authentic chain-mail armor battled it out and while their swords may have been blunt, some left with dented helmets and one, a cut lip.
Others on horseback showed off their skills by slicing cabbages and aubergines in half while on the move.
Nearby, metal smelters hammered weapons into shape, spice merchants prepared remedies and tradeswomen spun and dyed wool.
Deadly serious and exquisitely dressed, few dared to break character.
"Anyone can get dressed up but staying in character is an art form, I think," said Helena Stackpoole, who as "Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald" was putting her fashion design background to unique use.
"All the costumes are hand stitched.
I have a belt here that I'm embroidering and it's taken two years so far and the dress that I'm working on at the moment, the sleeves alone have 800 pearls hand sewn into them.
I'm a bit serious about this," she said.
Death toll from Indonesian quake, tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from an earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi rose to 832 on Sunday, the national disaster mitigation agency said, adding it assessed the affected area to be bigger than initially thought.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake which struck on Friday and triggered tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet), agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
FBI contact second accuser of court nominee Kavanaugh
FBI agents investigating U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have contacted the second woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct, her attorney said on Saturday.
The announcement by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer John Clune indicates that the FBI probe of Kavanaugh will look beyond separate allegations of attempted rape leveled against the conservative federal appeals court judge by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University dormitory when they were undergraduates.
U.S. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI investigation after Thursday's Senate hearing, during which Ford, a California university professor, detailed her claims that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when the two were still high school teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had constrained the FBI investigation by limiting its parameters.
Trump denied that story, tweeting that "Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion."
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate had set the "scope and duration" of the FBI probe, which is supposed to be wrapped up in a week.
"The White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do," Shah said.
UK will not give up environmental or animal standards after Brexit
The United Kingdom will not give up its high environmental or animal protection standards protections to win trade deals after Brexit, environment minister Michael Gove said on Sunday.
Britain's Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove arrives in Downing Street, London, September 24, 2018.
Speaking at an event on the fringes of the annual Conservative Party conference, Gove said it was an advantage for the United Kingdom to be known for quality food products and the government would announce a food strategy later this year.
Europe regain Ryder Cup with dominant singles display
Francesco Molinari fittingly took the glory as Europe regained the Ryder Cup in dominant style on Sunday, the Italian beating Phil Mickelson on the 16th to post the point needed to reach the magic tally of 14.5.
Mickelson conceded the hole after firing his tee shot into the water with Molinari on the green to leave the Italian as the first European to win all five matches in a week - having not won any of his previous six.
Europe were effectively already assured of victory when he teed off as the Italian, Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were all dormie and guaranteed at least half a point from their games - with Europe at that stage needing one.
They had started the day 10-6 up, needing to secure four and a half of the 12 points available to win back the trophy and extend their stranglehold on home soil that dates back to 1993.
Only twice before had a team come from four down going into the singles to win - the US doing so at Brookline in 1999 and Europe in 2012 in the "Miracle of Medinah," but another stunning comeback never really looked on the cards.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk's team a glimmer of hope with early wins but then the European points started pouring in from all over the course.
Thorbjorn Olesen hammered Jordan Spieth and fellow rookie Jon Rahm beat Tiger Woods - leaving the 14-times major champion with a stunning four defeats out of four.
Ian Poulter, "Mr Ryder Cup," then produced probably the loudest cheer of the week when world number one Dustin Johnson conceded on the 18th green to leave Europe on the verge.
It was then just a question of which match out on the course would finish next and it proved to be Molinari's - sparking amazing scenes of celebration watched by the biggest galleries in the event's history.
Neo-Nazi name used by German cops as codeword while guarding Erdogan on Berlin visit - RT World News
A pair of police officers in eastern Germany used the name of a notorious neo-Nazi extremist to work undercover during an operation to protect Turkish President Erdogan who visited Berlin this week, local media reveal.
Criminal police in the eastern German state of Saxony are inquiring into two members of elite counter-terrorism unit SEK, the regional interior ministry said.
The men were deployed to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his much-anticipated trip to Germany.
As the officers had to work undercover, protocol required that they use a codename.
Their choice was Uwe Boehnhardt, a notorious member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) - a neo-Nazi extremist group that slaughtered eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek citizen, and a German police officer in the 2000s.
The bizarre codename surfaced when the two signed up to access internal documents they needed for the deployment, local media report.
Officers in charge of the operation reacted swiftly, and the policemen were immediately recalled.
Petric Kleine, the head of Saxony criminal police, was first to react to the news.
He said the use of Boehnhardt's name was "hardly to be beaten in stupidity" and represented "blatant disregard of [his] victims and their relatives."
Roland Woller, Saxony's interior minister, echoed the words, calling it "disgusting, horrible and absolutely unacceptable."
Erdogan's Friday visit to Berlin has stirred considerable controversy in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for hosting a leader which some accuse of being increasingly authoritarian.
Merkel said the visit was very important "because when there are differences a personal meeting is vital to resolve them."
The NSU first came to light in 2011 when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were found inside a burnt-out motorhome in eastern Germany.
The two are believed to have died in an apparent murder-suicide after a failed bank robbery in a town of Eisenach.
Beate Zschaepe, the neo-Nazi gang's third and last surviving member, was detained shortly afterwards.
In July of this year, a German court sentenced her to life in prison, finding her guilty on 10 counts of murder.
She denied participating in the murders, although her lawyer said that she felt morally guilty for not trying to prevent the killings.
The scandal surrounding the NSU has led to widespread criticism of German security agencies.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of the victims believe that the group had far more accomplices.
It also came out that the BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, had placed numerous informants within the NSU and systematically thwarted and made impossible the investigation of murders, attempted murders, and robberies attributed to the group.
Musk to step down as Tesla chairman, pay $20mn fine as settlement with SEC
Elon Musk has settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which had sued him for fraud over his tweets about taking Tesla private.
Musk will have to step down as chairman, but gets to keep his CEO status.
According to the settlement filing, Musk has 45 days to step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, and is banned from holding the position for three years.
He will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
And since the whole affair started over a tweet, either careless or intentionally misleading, Musk is required to receive pre-approval for anything he says or posts about Tesla, "in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g., Twitter), the Company's website (e.g., the Company's blog), press releases, and investor calls."
Another $20mn will be paid by Tesla to settle claims it had failed to vet Musk's initial tweet.
The SEC complaint accused Musk of misleading investors with his August 7 tweet which said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, boosting the company's stock by more than 10 percent.
Musk soon recanted, saying he would keep Tesla private and triggering investors' fury.
The SEC ruled Musk's initial words "were false and misleading because they lacked any basis in fact."
Musk himself claimed it was an honest mistake, writing in a blog post that he was under the impression that he had secured the money in a meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.
Musk and the SEC had reportedly been close to a less punishing settlement, which would only have barred Musk from being chairman for two years and would not have required him to admit any guilt, but Musk backed out on Thursday.
Then on Friday, Tesla stock tanked, apparently causing him to change his mind again and accept the harsher conditions.
However, like the old deal, the new one does not require Musk to admit to being guilty of misleading investors.
Patriarch of Alexandria pledges support to canonical Ukrainian Church, urges Orthodox unity
Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has shown support for the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is part of the Moscow Patriarchate.
It comes amid a rift between the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.
Theodore II arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on Thursday, meeting high church representatives and the Orthodox faithful.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected hierarchs of the Orthodoxy, second only to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I have come here to tell you: Stay with the Orthodox faith and with the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
Ahead of the visit to Odessa, he met with the head of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Savva, who backed the canonical Ukrainian church as well.
The two also called for conflicts stemming from giving autocephality to the Ukrainian church to be avoided.
"We will always be with those who seeks the Orthodox unity," Theodore II pledged.
The Orthodox Church has faced a major crisis recently, following the Constantinople Patriarchy's move towards recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter is a constituent part of the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople has decided to send its exarchs to Kiev, effectively violating the rule in which one Orthodox Church is forbidden to interfere in the internal affairs of another.
Exarchs are special representatives of a patriarch, who technically have a higher position in the church hierarchy than Metropolitan Onufriy, the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to Constantinople's move, suspending the joint performance of church services and membership in all the structures led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
The decision, however, was said to be a "warning" to Constantinople against further hostile steps and does not constitute a complete break of inter-church ties.
Ukraine hosts three Orthodox Churches, yet only one of them - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate - is recognized by other Churches.
Most Ukrainian clerics recognize its authority, but the government has been openly courting one of the schismatic churches - the so-called Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.
The religious movement even has its own self-proclaimed "Patriarch" Filaret, who seeks to gain the official status of an Orthodox Church, fully independent and "equal" to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus reopens main Syria-Jordan trade crossing for 1st time in 3 years
The Syrian government said it will reopen its main Nasib border crossing with neighboring Jordan, which remained closed during three years of hostilities in the area, state news agency SANA reports.
The opening became possible after Syria's side of the crossing was cleared of militants holding swathes of land around the city of Daraa.
Nasib is a key point connecting trade routes between the neighboring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Major takeaways from Lavrov's UN speech
At the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lashed out at the West's "political blackmail and brute force," saying diplomacy should not give way to diktats and unilateral sanctions.
Trying to preserve their "self-proclaimed status as world leaders," some Western powers have no qualms about putting pressure on others, Foreign Minister Lavrov told the UN General Assembly on Friday.
He didn't name the countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force."
The world has to pay a high price for these selfish ambitions by a tiny group of countries.
Lavrov, who was once Russia's envoy to the UN for a decade, told the gathering that the culture of diplomacy and negotiating is being replaced by diktats and one-sided sanctions put in place without UN approval.
Such restrictions that extend to dozens of countries "are either unlawful or inefficient," the minister noted, citing the US" decades-long blockade of Cuba.
"But history didn't teach us anything," Lavrov said, adding that allegations "based on the notorious "highly likely" thing are sufficient for some Western counterparts to pin the blame on anyone."
We do remember how often these unfounded claims were used to justify interventions and ignite wars, such the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, 2003 invasion of Iraq and 2011 intervention in Libya.
The list of Western-led invasions was obviously not exhaustive, as Lavrov referred to the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest instances.
A failed attempt to topple the regime in Damascus - which was conducted by engaging extremists - could have seen the whole country collapse and give way to a "terrorist caliphate."
Lavrov praised the Astana Peace Process, launched jointly by Russia, Turkey, and Iran, which he said helped prevent Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and other groups from claiming all of Syria.
Top priority now is to rebuild war-ridden places in the country and help refugees safely return to their homes.
Jumping back to the great powers competition, Lavrov stated that the UN was in fact created "on the lessons learnt from the Second World War."
The Russian foreign minister noted that 2018 marks 80 years since the "disgraceful" 1938 Munich Agreement, in which France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazi annexation of the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia in a bid to appease Hitler.
Though Neville Chamberlain, then British prime minister, claimed the Munich Agreement meant "peace for our time," the war started one year later.
"The Munich betrayal" shows us how far "national egoism and neglect of international law" can go, Lavrov said.
"Colonial-era diktat and coercion should be sent into the archive or the dustbin of history."
Moscow believes constructive dialogue can meet any challenges that arise in world affairs, according to Lavrov.
"If you have any questions or claims to anyone, then sit down and talk, show facts, listen to your counterpart's arguments, try to balance your interests."
Mote in the eye?
What we know about Israel's murky "nukes" as Bibi points finger at Iran - RT World News
During his UN General Assembly (UNGA) speech, the Israeli PM was adamant that Tehran has secret nuclear sites.
As Israel keeps playing the blame game, let's see if they have their own radioactive skeletons in the closet.
Using his cherished "presentations," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out with his new revelations on Thursday, showing aerial photographs of Iranian sites allegedly holding nuclear-related material.
It did not take long for Tehran to fire back, saying Tel-Aviv is better to look at its own "undeclared nuclear weapons program."
While Israel has never admitted - notably, not denied as well - to possess military nukes, RT's Murad Gazdiev looks at whether Tel Aviv may really be not the right country to point its fingers at others.
Scottish Government: No complaints made against Alex Salmond before January
The Scottish Government has said there were no recorded complaints regarding Alex Salmond before January this year.
Two allegations of sexual harassment were made in January against the former first minister, who strongly denies the claims.
He was informed of an investigation in March.
Mr Salmond, who has since resigned from the SNP, is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.
The Scottish Government stressed no complaints had been recorded prior to January after claims that one of those complaints was first investigated in 2013.
A Scottish Government spokesman said: "The Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond.
These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.
No complaints were raised with the then deputy first minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.
We are confident our processes are legally sound and we will vigorously defend our position.
In the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.
However, as we have said previously, for legal reasons we can make no further comment on the issues relating to Mr Salmond at this time."
A spokesman for Alex Salmond said: "We have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session and we expect it to be called shortly.
We will do our talking in court.
Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government's complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."
Glasgow 29-13 Dragons: Lee Jones at double for Warriors
Glasgow got back to winning ways in the Guinness Pro14 with a bonus-point victory over Dragons at Scotstoun as coach Dave Rennie expressed satisfaction but felt his side could have been more clinical.
After the shock defeat by Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth the previous Saturday, Rennie had called for a response from a much-changed team and, while the maximum points were duly bagged to stay top of Conference A, it was far from emphatic in what was a disjointed encounter played in swirling wind and rain.
"I thought our defence was excellent tonight, we played at the right end of the field and our setpiece was great," said Rennie.
"We need to be a bit more clinical, there were more opportunities that had to be taken.
It was trying conditions.
We created lots of opportunities which we're happy about.
We want to be more clinical but having said that if we had put 40 or 50 points on the board tonight that wouldn't have been good for us.
We had to work for that.
A bonus-point win but we need to be better next week at home to Zebre and the week after against Saracens in Europe."
In windy conditions, Glasgow looked to have opened the scoring early but the TMO picked up the slightest of knock-ons from Huw Jones as he looked to have gathered Niko Matawalu's inside pass and gone over in the left corner.
The frustration didn't last long as in the fourth minute loosehead prop Oli Kebble burst through the middle and Adam Hastings pinged over the easy conversion.
Dragons reduced the lead with a penalty from Arwel Robson and the stand-off knocked over another just after the 20-minute mark to bring the Welsh to within a point.
A fairly tame opening half found some kind of life around the half-hour mark as Glasgow's forwards established a sustained siege of the Dragons line before South African referee Stuart Berry penalised the Welsh side for an offside tackle in the 22 on home stand-off Hastings.
Warriors opted for the scrum but surrendered possession before putting together their most fluid passage of play, left wing Matawalu not quite able to keep control of the ball after some punchy surges and a sweeping passing move out left.
The second try finally came two minutes from the interval when Hastings pierced the Dragons line and then popped a clever pass out to Lee Jones, whose momentum saw him crash over.
Hastings saw his conversion come back off the post to make it 12-6 at half-time.
Glasgow got off to the best possible start in the first minute of the second half as Alex Dunbar's delicious offload in the tackle was gleefully gobbled up by Lee Jones for his second try, Hastings adding the extras.
However, any sense that the Warriors would now run away with things received a setback just four minutes later when possession was coughed up in the midfield and a fly hack was followed up by Dragons centre Adam Warren who dribbled over to score under the posts, Josh Lewis, who had come on for Robson before the break, converting.
Warriors swiftly reasserted dominance and the bonus-point fourth try came in the 54th minute as Huw Jones surged over down the right, Hastings falling short with the conversion - his third miss from four attempts.
Glasgow remained in comfortable ascendancy and the fifth try came with a couple of minutes left as Dunbar got on the end of a sweet offload by sub scrum-half George Horne to cruise over and Hastings" boot completed the scoring.
Kebble was awarded man of the match but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously didn't want us to play and were flying up in the middle," said the coach.
"He probably needed to hold a couple of metres of depth but he's pretty slippery and managed to find some space in behind them.
He's in a good vein of form and confident."
Morton 1 - 5 Ayr United: Five star Ayr hammer hosts
Ayr stay top of the Championship table thanks to doubles from Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore and a goal from Declan McDaid.
Shankland swept Ayr into the lead from six yards after Michael Rose had headed a McDaid corner back across goal.
Morton levelled with their first effort on target on 35 minutes when Charlie Telfer robbed a dithering Robbie Crawford inside his own box and sent a low shot arrowing past Ayr keeper Ross Doohan and into the far corner.
The Greenock side were presented with a great opportunity to take the lead four minutes into the second half when Gary Oliver was sent tumbling by Doohan but Michael Tidser's penalty was weakly hit and easily gathered by the keeper.
Ayr moved in front a second time on 74 minutes when a cross from substitute Craig McGuffie was deflected high into the air and when it fell to earth fellow replacement Craig Moore prodded home.
Within a minute Moore cut the ball back for Shankland and the striker scored his 17th goal of the season.
As the visitors ran riot Moore rifled home the fourth from the edge of the box and McDaid slammed home a rebound to complete the scoring.
Alloa 0 - 2 Falkirk: Bairns earn first league win
"Delighted, relieved, happy," beamed Ray McKinnon after Falkirk finally registered their desperately-needed first league victory and points of the season.
A double from 18-year-old on-loan Rangers striker Zak Rudden either side of half-time hauled the Bairns level with hosts Alloa Athletic at the foot of the Championship and lifted a weight off the shoulders of the club.
"It was an important game for us," admitted McKinnon.
"In the last three games, we probably merited more, so it was nice to come here and pick up the three points in such a pressure situation.
I'm really pleased to get the first points on the board.
It wouldn't have been defining, but it was important we got the win."
Rudden nodded in a Patrick Brough cross in the 26th minute and then bundled in on the goal-line midway through the second-half after Deimantas Petravicius had lifted his lobbed shot over keeper Neil Parry.
"We hoped to make this place a fortress but that hasn't been the case," admitted Wasps manager Jim Goodwin.
More than 11,000 sign Hearts fan's petition against semi-final debacle
A Hearts fan's petition against the schedule of the Betfred Cup semi-finals has attracted more than 11,000 signatures.
It comes as anger continues to mount over the decision to play both semi-finals on the same day in the same stadium.
The SPFL opted last week, with the advice of Police Scotland, to schedule the Aberdeen v Rangers tie for 12pm and Hearts v Celtic for 7.45pm, provoking fury among fans of both the Jambos and the Dons.
The Evening News teamed up with the Aberdeen Evening Express on Saturday to call for a fair deal for fans.
The so-called "Super Sunday" decision was condemned by both Aberdeen and Hearts, the clubs releasing their own statements criticising the scheduling.
The petition was started on change.org on Thursday evening calling for one of the fixtures to be moved to another venue or be played on another date.

Neighbours spoke of their shock of what had happened in such a "quiet and friendly" village.

Royal archives team up with Hamilton to teach the world about King George III
When the Queen launched a project to open her enormous archive of papers from the reign of George III, it was hoped the letters, diaries and speeches would give the public an insight far beyond his reputation for madness.
Now, those papers are to reach a whole new audience, as the Royal Archives form an unlikely alliance with a hit West End musical.
The actor who plays George III in Hamilton has been invited into the library at Windsor Castle to study key documents from the reign of the Queen's great-great-great-great- grandfather, as academics hope to inspire others to learn more about the real king.
Those documents will now be made available digitally for the show's legions of fans, as researchers work to bring their "pieces of paper with old handwriting on" to a wider audience.
Members of the Royal family have already given their public approval to the musical, with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex going to see it twice despite Prince Harry's ancestor being thoroughly sent up on stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays the role in the West End, said he had been left with a lot to think about after studying the papers, which shed light on the king who is sealed in the public's imagination from his portrayal in Hamilton, The Madness of King George and the children's series Horrible Histories.
'We fell in love' after 'beautiful letters'
US President Donald Trump took his enthusiasm for his detente with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to new heights on Saturday, declaring at a rally with supporters that "we fell in love" after exchanging letters.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim have said they want to work toward denuclearising the Korean peninsula, holding an unprecedented meeting earlier this year in Singapore to discuss the idea.
Before they turned the page on decades of public acrimony, the leaders regularly traded threats and insults as North Korea pushed to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States.
"I was really being tough - and so was he.
And we would go back and forth," Mr Trump told a rally in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, okay?
No, really - he wrote me beautiful letters, and they're great letters," he said.
Juliette Lewis joins cast of 'Roseanne' spinoff 'The Conners'
A Million Little Pieces and Camping star Juliette Lewis confirmed via Twitter she has joined the cast of the Roseanne spinoff The Conners.
"Yep this is happening.
The secret is out!! #JulietteLewisisontheconners #TheConners," the actress tweeted this week, along with a photo of her holding a script with the sitcom's name emblazoned on the front of it.
Another post features a photo of Lewis with Johnny Galecki and Sara Gilbert, who play exes David and Darlene on the show.
"Guess who's stoppin by #TheConners ??!!
Reuniting with my Grizwald brother!
So exciting.
The writing is SOOOOO GOOOD. #JulietteLewisisonTheConners," Lewis wrote.
Lewis and Galecki played siblings Audrey and Rusty Griswold in the 1989 movie Christmas Vacation.
The Hollywood Reporter said Lewis will play Galecki's girlfriend Blue, but it is unclear in how many episodes they will appear.
The Conners is scheduled to debut on Oct.
It earned high ratings when it returned this spring and was renewed for another season, but the show was canceled and creator-star Roseanne Barr was fired in May after Barr tweeted a racist joke about a former Obama administration official.
Most of the original cast members from Roseanne -- including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman -- are to star in The Conners.
Showtime cancels 'I'm Dying Up Here' after two seasons
"I'm Dying Up Here," a Showtime dramedy Jim Carrey produced, has been canceled after two seasons.
Showtime has declined to order a third season of the Jim Carrey-produced dramedy I'm Dying Up Here.
Deadline.com said low viewership was to blame for the cable network's decision to cancel the show.
Starring Melissa Leo, Ari Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy and Andrew Santino, the series took place in the stand-up comedy scene of 1970s Los Angeles.
"I'm very grateful for these last three years. when people ask me about the show, i say "it's a complicated show about complicated people...but it was really fun to make." thanks for watching xox," Angarano tweeted Friday.

"A Florida police station in the middle of the night," a synopsis said.

Writer-producer Rhimes and Washington previously worked together on the ABC political drama Scandal for seven seasons.
Eva Green, Marton Csokas to star in BBC drama 'The Luminaries'
Penny Dreadful actress Eva Green, Into the Badlands actor Marton Csokas and Robin Hood alum Eve Hewson are to star in the BBC's six-part drama, The Luminaries.
The series based on Eleanor Catton's Man Booker Prize-winning novel is to begin filming in November.
The story takes place during the 1860s gold rush in New Zealand.
Eleanor has written a series of brilliant screenplays.
I loved her original novel and it's so exciting that her own screen adaptation reveals yet more exquisite material," Green said in a statement.
"I've had tremendous fun adapting this novel for the screen and feel incredibly lucky to be working with such fantastic people across different art forms," Catton added.
"Writing a novel is a solitary business, but writing for the screen is emphatically collaborative, and to see the world of The Luminaries enlarged and enriched in ways that go far beyond the scope of my own imagination has been a humbling and hugely exhilarating experience.
I couldn't be happier that the brilliant Claire McCarthy is at the helm, and I can't wait to see this incredible cast bring the story to life."
Redshirt season no longer a possibility for Alabama's Hurts
The idea of Alabama backup quarterback Jalen Hurts possibly redshirting this season came to an end Saturday.
Hurts was inserted into Saturday's matchup for the top-ranked Crimson Tide against overmatched Louisiana, marking the fifth game he has appeared in this season.
Per a new NCAA rule this season, a player can appear in as many as four games and still qualify for a redshirt season.
A report by the Athletic earlier this month suggested Hurts was planning to take that route due to his frustration over the quarterback controversy and how it was handled by the team's coaching staff.
Tua Tagovailoa supplanted Hurts as the starter this season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he still plans to take advantage of Hurts' skill set.
Hurts guided Alabama to the national championship game against Georgia last season, but he was replaced in the second half by Tagovailoa, who rallied the Crimson Tide to a 26-23 victory.
The former SEC Offensive Player of the Year, Hurts entered this season having started the previous 28 games for Alabama, posting a 26-2 record.
Entering Saturday's contest, Hurts completed 22 of 31 passes for 276 yards with four touchdowns and one interception in the Crimson Tide's first four games.
He also rushed 15 times for 54 yards.
Owens: Dez needs to act on idea of signing 'soon'
Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant predicted he will "soon" be returning to the NFL.
Hall of Famer Terrell Owens said for Bryant's sake, that time can't come soon enough.
Responding to a question on Twitter on when he plans to sign with a team, Bryant on Friday offered a one-word tweet: "Soon."
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bryant has been without a team since the Dallas Cowboys released him in mid-April in a salary dispute.
Bryant, who reportedly rejected a contract offer from the Baltimore Ravens and has continually been linked to the Cleveland Browns, said just prior to the season that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with a team.
Owens, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August and still makes noises about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant's focus should be on getting back on the field -- immediately.
"He has to get on the team and prove to everyone what he feels like he is capable of doing," Owens told the website.
"Because everybody, if you listen to all the commentators, they feel he's lost a step, he's not the guy he once was, that he feels like he is.
At this point the game, get on a roster, no matter what the money is -- if its's a one-year deal, two-year deal, whatever the case may be -- and show everybody what you're made of, what you're capable of doing."
Bryant had a team-leading 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns with Dallas in 2017.
The 29-year-old has gone a career-long 23 regular-season games without a 100-yard performance.
Since signing a five-year, $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant has failed to record a 1,000-yard season or make more than eight touchdown receptions in a season.
"From a general manager's or owner's standpoint, when they feel your skillset is declining, you're not going to warrant or garner that money you're really looking for," advised Owens,.
Warning that if Bryant doesn't find his way onto a roster in the near future, "then it's not going to happen," Owens said the idea of a reunion with the struggling Cowboys should be pursued.
"Absolutely. I dont know if that relationship is fractured," said Owens, who had 38 touchdowns in three seasons with Dallas.
"I think for Dez, if the Cowboys welcomed him back and he gets an opportunity, then that bodes well for Dez and the franchise."
