A380 makes maiden flight to US
March 19, 2007
The Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane, was set to land in the United States of America on Monday after a test flight.
One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people.
It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers, though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa.
A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday, but without passengers.
This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport.
The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number, and is due to arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 12:30 EST (16:30 UTC).
The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work.
Deliveries to Singapore Airlines, its launch customer, are not due until October - two years late.
Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion dollars.
Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come.
These monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus, called Power8, in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners.
France will lose 4,300 jobs, followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs, while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively.
The Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million € (US$ 199 million) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers.
Aer Lingus buys twelve new long-haul Airbus jets
June 9, 2007
Irish national airline Aer Lingus have purchased 12 new long-haul Airbus aircraft as a means of modernising it's long-haul fleet and improving it's transatlantic network.
Under the agreement, Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will receive six new A330-300E aircraft from 2009 to 2011, then between 2014 and 2016 it will take delivery of six new A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) aircraft, a new design currently under development by Airbus.
Aer Lingus also have options of six more A350s to exercise by 2018.
Aer Lingus already operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 30 short-haul aircraft( 24 A320s and 6 A321s) and eight long-haul A330s, and had made the purchase of new long-haul airliners a top priority since the formerly state-owned company was floated on British and Irish stock markets in September 2006.
The airline had approached Airbus rival Boeing regarding a potential deal for their new 787 aircraft, but Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion stated that he believed the Airbus aircraft were “better on fuel and better on range” than the 787.
He also said that, although the aircraft have a catalogue value of €1.78 billion (US$2.4 billion), Airbus had offered them at an "exceptional discounts” on them.
Some of the A330s will be replaced by the new aircraft.
As well as new routes to the US, Mannion stated that there was a possibility of routes elsewhere resulting from the new aircraft as well, saying, “We will prioritize the U.S. (but) we have an eye as to what's happening to the Far East and South Africa.”
The airline already offers flights to New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dubai, and recently launched 3 new U.S. routes to San Francisco, Orlando, and Washington.
Aer Lingus shares on the Irish Stock Exchange fell 2.5 percent to €2.73 ($3.68) the day the deal was announced.
It will fall through unless backed by shareholders.
Aer Lingus rival Ryanair has been attempting to take over Aer Lingus since December, and if this bid is successful, the new aircraft may become redundant as Ryanair intends to end transatlantic services.
However, the Irish government, which holds a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus, disapproves of the takeover, as do Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that hold more than 15 percent shares.
Ryanair owns a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus.
The takeover is also unlikely to receive regulatory approval from the European Union.
Mannion said of the integration of the new aircraft "The A350 XWB fits in with our ambitious plans to expand existing routes and to open up new ones from our hub in Dublin.
We already have an all Airbus fleet and the new aircraft will fit in seamlessly."
Aeroflot negotiates purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft
June 10, 2007
Russian flag carrier Aeroflot has negotiated the purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, an aircraft Boeing currently has under development.
The first jets will be delivered in 2014.
The Dreamliner will be the first commercial jet to be manufactured mainly with carbon-fiber composites instead of the aluminium previously used.
The deal was announced during a large business forum that President Vladimir Putin had set up to showcase his country's role in the international market.
The deal was the centrepiece of the event.
The sale is the result of a deal begun between Aeroflot and Chicago-based Boeing last year, but negotiations had stalled due to worsening relations between the US and Russia.
Aeroflot has suffered as a result of the delay.
If had the sale gone through last year, the aircraft would have been delivered by 2011.
The aircraft have a pre-modification catalogue value of US$3.5 billion, although neither of the companies involved would reveal the actual agreement reached between the two firms.
When asked whether the deal should be seen as a step towards a resolution of the rift between Russia and the US, Boeing Executive Vice President Scott Carson replied, "It represents a business relationship between our Company and Aeroflot, and I'm really proud of it,".
Boeing has had a policy of Russian involvement dating back to the early 1990s.
More recently, Boeing has entered into an agreement with Russian manufacturer Sukhoi for worldwide marketing and after-sales support for their regional aircraft, the Superjet, and have reached a deal with Kremlin-owned Unified Aircraft for general co-operation.
They also have a Moscow design centre that has 1,400 employees and a 30-year contract for supply of titanium parts with Russia's VSMPO-Avisma, which Boeing estimates to be worth $18 million.
It has been reported that the deal between Boeing and Aeroflot was revived after Boeing promised that technical assistance would be provided to Aeroflot for the new aircraft.
Aeroflot's current fleet of Boeing and Airbus aircraft was built during the Soviet era.
Aeroflot say that the deal does not affect plans to purchase new Airbuses at a later date for later delivery.
Airbus A380 test flight delayed after accident
September 1, 2007
A test flight of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo, the largest passenger jet in the world, was delayed today after a superficial accident at Suvarnabhumi Airport, which serves Bangkok, Thailand.
The minor accident occurred during push back, as the aircraft was leaving a parking space before it was due to fly to Chiang Mai International Airport.
As the jet was being pushed back by a Thai Airways International tug operator, the left winglet struck the side of the hangar, and was crumpled against it.
The winglets, designed to improve fuel efficiency, are non-vital parts.
After an inspection, Airbus decided to remove both winglets and continue the flight without them.
The plane left four hours after its scheduled 9:45 a.m. local time departure, carrying 150 passengers.
The flight was intended to counteract criticisms that the massive airliner, which has a 79-metre wingspan, is too big (and thus too complex for ground crews) to be practically operated at most airports.
It also demonstrates continuing problems at Suvarnabhumi airport, which has suffered various incidents since it opened last September, the most severe of which being the discovery of large cracks in airport taxiways shortly after opening.
Airbus has said they will continue with their tour of Asia demonstrating the plane.
Airbus announces job cuts of 10,000
February 28, 2007
Airbus, Europe's biggest aircraft manufacturer, has announced 10,000 job cuts over the next four years.
The news comes as its parent company, EADS starts a major restructuring programme because the company is not efficient enough.
Louis Gallois, the Airbus chief executive, said the company expects to cut approximately 4,300 jobs in France, 3,700 in Germany, 1,600 in UK and 400 in Spain.
About half of those cuts will be made among subcontractors and temporary workers.
Actual Airbus employee reduction would be about 5,000, or 9% of the total European work force of 55,000 full-time Airbus employees.
Although Gallois said he hoped to achieve this mainly through attrition, the unions were displeased.
Union officials said nearly 14,000 employees at four French sites had a two hour work stoppage Wednesday afternoon to protest the cuts.
"The response has been massive," said Julien Talavan, a spokesman for Force Ouvrière, the main Airbus union in France.
"This is just the beginning," he said, hinting at future labor action.
This move comes after well-publicized delays on its A380 super-jumbo commercial airliner.
The restructuring announcement also includes the proposed sale or closure of 3 plants.
Airbus launches world's largest passenger plane
January 18, 2005
In a ceremony attended by several European political leaders and 5,000 VIP guests, Airbus unveiled plans for the A380, a twin-deck aircraft that can carry up to 840 people in all-economy class (550 for a Boeing 747), or 555 people in typical three mixed classes layout.
The new aircraft will take the world's-largest title away from rival Boeing's 747.
Boeing's upcoming new design, the 7e7, does not attempt to compete directly with the A380 but instead is aimed at a more efficient and comfortable flight at 200-250 seats.
Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard stated that he expected sales of the aircraft to exceed the 250 required for the project to break even.
To date, 149 confirmed orders for the aircraft have been received.
Airbus has hopes that sales will exceed 700.
The company is currently in talks with China regarding possible sales there.
The first test flight of the aircraft may take place as early as March, and the first commercial flight is expected to take off in mid-2006 from Singapore's Changi Airport.
British and American airline Virgin Atlantic has purchased six of these aeroplanes and intend to fit them with gyms and bars as well as seats.
Airbus offers funding to search for black boxes from Air France disaster
July 30, 2009
Airbus have announced that they will be willing to contribute between €12 million and €20 million (about US$16 million to $28 million) to fund an extended search for the black boxes from Air France Flight 447.
The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June, killing all 228 people on board.
Chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement, "We want to know what happened, as improving air safety is our top priority.
We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution."
Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations, the required impartiality makes funding rare, with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company's move was unprecedented.
"This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation," Schaffrath explained.
France's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France.
Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA.
Investigators have already given up looking for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder using the conventional method of tracing audio 'pingers', the batteries of which would have expired after 30–40 days.
Efforts are ongoing using sensitive equipment under tow from a French naval vessel, but if this search proves fruitless then the BEA will seek money for a further three-month search.
The jet's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was able to transmit information regarding problems on board prior to the crash.
The ACARS data suggests that the plane had suffered from a loss of valuable readings including airspeed, leading suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system which supplies various measurements.
Airbus had already recommended that one component of this system, the pitot tubes, be replaced on A330s.
Air France had not done this on the accident airplane although the entire fleet now features the modified design.
Three other incidents have been identified since that may involve similar circumstances.
The United States National Transportation Safety Board is probing two over American soil while earlier this month another Air France A330 equipped with the new tubes suffered a similar series of problems enroute from Italy to France.
Airbus parent EADS wins £13 billion UK RAF airtanker contract
March 27, 2008
European Aeronautic Defence & Space NV (EADS), the parent company of European airframer Airbus, has won a £13 billion contract to supply the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF) with aerial refueling tankers to replace the nation's current ageing fleet.
AirTanker Ltd., an EADS-led consortium, have signed a 27-year contract with the Defense Ministry to supply 14 new Airbus A330-200 passenger airliner converted for the task.
They will be owned by AirTanker, who retains commercial leasing rights to five which can carry 290 passengers plus cargo, but will fly in RAF livery.
They replace existing Lockheed Tristar and Vickers VC-10 aircraft.
The first aircraft will be in service by 2011 and all by 2016.
Rolls-Royce, part of the consortium, will supply engines.
France's Thales will supply electronics, Wimborne, UK's Cobham will manufacture refueling equipment and Southampton, UK's VT Group will provide service management.
Last month, Northrop Grumman and EADS defeated Boeing to win a massive order for 179 tankers from the United States Air Force.
Airbus has also inked recent deals with the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Saudi Air Force and the UAE Air Force.
Airbus wins Qatar Airways order worth $15bn
June 13, 2005
European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, has won an order from Qatar Airways for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A350 jets.
The order, which is believed to be worth $15 billion, has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show, which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing.
Qatar Airways, which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing's 787, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion.
Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new A380's which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of London Heathrow.
In 2004, Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever, sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market.
However thus far, Boeing has received far more orders than Airbus in 2005.
Boeing 787 "Dreamliner" makes maiden flight
December 16, 2009
Boeing's newest commercial aircraft, the 787 "Dreamliner", made its first test flight Tuesday in Everett, Washington at 18:00 UTC.
Boeing claims that the new 290+ seat wide-body, twin engine jetliner is more fuel efficient than previous Boeing models.
The release of the "Dreamliner" is almost two and a half years behind schedule.
The project has been plagued by various issues, including strike action, parts shortages and design problems.
The aircraft is thought to have attracted 840 orders to date, though some have been cancelled due to the delays, making the 787 worth in the region of US$140bn (€96bn, £86bn) for Boeing.
An aerospace analyst, Richard Aboulafia, said that "[The test flight] will provide a badly needed perception that the program is on some kind of schedule again, but it's still a long way from the ultimate result."
Boeing's European rival, Airbus, is preparing to release a similar aircraft, the A350, in 2013.
Boeing allowed to bid for U.S. space launch contracts again
March 6, 2005
Boeing's Launch Systems, Launch Services and Delta Program business units are to be allowed to bid once more for U.S. space launch contracts, the USAF has announced.
Boeing had been suspended since July 24, 2003 after violating federal law.
The company was discovered to have been in possession of thousands of pages of documentation from Lockheed Martin, Boeing's rival during the 1998 evolved expendable launch vehicle source selection process.
The USAF and Boeing have signed an interim agreement to protect the Air Force's interests.
The agreement allows for the reinstating of the suspension if Boeing is indicted or convicted, or if new evidence is found.
Boeing will have to submit to outside verification of the remedial steps it has taken, and cannot charge the Air Force for associated costs.
Internal management responsibilities for ethical practice have been changed.
Lockheed Martin's Atlas V and Boeing's Delta IV are two types of expendable rocket, designed to reduce the cost of space launches.
Boeing delivers final 717 to AirTran, ending Douglas era
May 29, 2006
Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Tuesday delivered the final 717 jet built to AirTran Airways in ceremonies in Long Beach, California, bringing production of McDonnell Douglas jets to an end.
"AirTran Airways would like to thank the many Boeing employees for their hard work and dedication over the years and enabling us to build a world-class aircraft fleet that is unparalleled in the aviation industry," said Joe Leonard, Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of AirTran Airways.
The final Boeing 717 was the 15,599th plane built by the Long Beach plant, the original home of Douglas Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas.
It also marked the end of the popular DC-9 family of jets, which has sold over 2,400 units over its 41-year history.
In 1995, McDonnell Douglas introduced the MD-95, which later became the Boeing 717 when McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1996.
The 717 had suffered from slow sales throughout its history, with 155 planes ordered.
In January 2005, Boeing announced that it would cancel the 717 program after completing all outstanding orders.
The 717 program's demise leaves the C-17 military cargo jet as the only remaining jet aircraft built in California.
Some workers from the 717 program have transferred to the C-17 program.
Its future is also uncertain as Boeing's contract to produce the aircraft expires in 2008.
Boeing pushes back 737 replacement development
May 24, 2008
United States airframer Boeing has announced that development of a replacement for their 737 narrowbody airliner, begun two years ago, has been pushed back several years, Boeing saying that further advancement of technology is required.
Spokeswoman Sandy Angers said that that the team formed to look at the development had been merged into the parent product development team and would cease looking at specific designs.
Boeing say airlines demand performance improvements of 15-20% are required if a new airliner is to be commercially viable.
"We've reduced our airplane-design effort and are focusing more on the technology breakthroughs," said Angers.
"We need technology breakthroughs in engines, aerodynamics, materials and other systems.
You can't simply shrink the 787 and expect the same benefits for the narrow-body market.
We've got difficult challenges."
One important difference is that the plastic composite used for the fuselage of the 787 would not offer as significant a weight saving on a smaller aircraft.
The delivery date for the plane is now anticipated to be around 2020, and not 2015 as previously hoped.
This coincides with the expected date for Airbus to deliver their A320 replacement.
Industry analysts predict development of one to trigger development of the other.
Boeing had hoped to have their's ready for 2012.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Scott Carson said "We're continuing our research effort until we find the right solution.
It has to be a 25-year product."
Since its 1967 debut 5,700 737s have been deliverd to date, with orders for 2,200 more, keeping the jet in production until at least 2014.
It is Boeing's most popular airliner.
Boeing rolls out first 787 Dreamliner to go into service
August 8, 2011
Three years after it was first due for delivery, Boeing has rolled out the first that is to be delivered to a customer.
Japan's (ANA) were to take delivery in May 2008, but will now receive the aircraft next month.
The plane promises increased fuel efficiency as it is the first model to be built out of plastic and carbon composites, more lightweight than conventional materials.
Boeing says they have 800 orders at 200 million per aircraft.
Launch customer ANA have ordered 55.
Delayed by Boeing's outsourcing system to a variety of subcontractors, two models have been developed.
The 787-8 holds between 210 and 250 passengers; the 787-9 holds 250 to 290.
Airlines choose the seating layout they want.
After the 787, already bearing ANA's livery, arrives in Tokyo next month, the airline will use its first commercial flight for a special charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong.
"We plan to use the 787 to expand our business, particularly our international routes," says ANA senior vice president Mitsuo Morimoto.
"We plan to increase our revenue from international route significantly and the 787 will play an instrumental role in this," he adds, noting flights to Europe or the US are possibles for 787s.
"We are rolling out the first delivery airplane, the first 787," enthused Scott Fancher, 787 project manager and Boeing vice president.
"That's an amazing thing for those who have worked on the program five, six, seven years, here at Boeing and our partners around the world."
Boeing says they must increase the tempo of production from two a month to ten, if they are to meet customer demand.
"It's an extraordinary challenge, no one has ever built a wide body aircraft at the rate of 10 per month before," claims writer John Ostrower.
Boeing secures $11bn of aircraft deals
April 27, 2005
Boeing has secured two large orders for new aircraft.
Air Canada has ordered US$6 billion in new airliners, while Air India has signed a deal for a further US$7 billion.
The Air Canada deal includes firm orders for 18 777s and 14 of the new mid-size, long-range 787 Dreamliner.
Options are included for 18 more 777s and 46 more 787s.
The Air India order is worth US$6.8 billion for 50 787s.
Air India says the new fuel-efficient airliner will save US$300 million in fuel a year, while Air Canada has estimated a 30% fuel saving over their existing 767s.
Air India have also said that the 20 extra seats the 787 offers over a similarly-sized Airbus A330 was a decisive factor.
Korean Air also bought 20 Dreamliners earlier this month.
Boeing now has a total of 237 orders and commitments for the 787.
The Boeing 777 is a family of long range widebody twin engine airliners built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
It carries between 305 and 550 passengers and has a range from 5,600 to 8,870 nautical miles (10,400 to 16,400 km).
The first flight of the 777 was in 1994.
The Boeing 787, or Dreamliner, is a mid-sized passenger airliner currently under development by Boeing Commercial Airplanes and scheduled to enter service in 2008.
It will carry between 200 and 350 passengers depending on the seating configuration, and be more fuel-efficient than earlier airliners.
In addition, it will be the first major airliner to use composite material in the majority of its construction.
Boeing unveils long-range 777
February 17, 2005
Boeing has unveiled a new ultra-long range version of its 777 airliner, capable of flying from London to Sydney non-stop.
The 777-200LR can fly for 9,420 nautical miles (17,446 kilometers) with 301 passengers onboard, giving it a range greater than any other airliner in the world.
The aircraft can fly from New York to Singapore and from Los Angeles to Dubai with a full passenger and luggage load non-stop, and has been named the Worldliner by Boeing to mark the fact it can connect almost any two cities on Earth.
Although it can fly from London to Sydney non-stop, the 777-200LR will have to break its return journey to refuel due to direction of the prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere.
So far, Boeing has received five orders from two customers for the 777-200LR since it was announced in February 2000.
The first of the new airliner will be delivered to Pakistan International Airlines in January 2006.
EVA Airways is the other launch customer.
First flight is scheduled in early March.
The 777-200LR will be the basis for an all-freight version of the 777, announced last November.
Boeing's European rival Airbus, which has out-sold Boeing since 2003, believes that the future of passenger flight is in very large aircraft like its new twin-deck A380 airliner flying up to 840 people between a relatively small number of large hub airports world-wide.
Passengers would then take connecting flights to reach their final destinations.
Boeing, by contrast, believes passengers will want to fly direct between more local airports too small to handle aircraft like the A380.
Boeing unveils new 787 Dreamliner
July 9, 2007
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing have unveiled their new 787 Dreamliner at their Everett Factory near Seattle, Washington, in the United States.
Sunday was chosen as its date matches the aircraft's designation number when written in the American format, 7/8/07.
The event was attended by 15,000 people including employees, customers, suppliers and officials from government and the local community.
Scott Carson, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said, "This has been a wonderful and exciting day to celebrate this breakthrough airplane with our customers, employees, supplier partners and our communities."
The mid-sized 787 will seat between 210 and 330 passengers, and will be the first commercial airliner of a mostly carbon fibre composites construction.
Boeing claims that the resulting reduction of weight compared to the traditional aluminium will offer enhanced fuel efficiency, benefiting both operators and the environment.
According to the company, the 787 Dreamliner will use 20 percent less fuel per passenger than similarly sized aircraft.
On Saturday, Boeing announced 35 new orders from German airline Air Berlin and ALAFCO Aviation Lease & Finance of Kuwait, bringing the total to 677 orders from 47 customers.
At the list price, these orders are worth US$5.62 billion.
The first flight is expected to take place in August or September of this year, with the first customer, All Nippon Airways, due to receive their first aircraft in May 2008.
The 787 illustrates the differing strategies adopted by Boeing and Airbus whose double-decker A380 first flew in April 2005 and is expected to enter service later this year.
Whereas the Airbus A380 is aimed at flying large passenger numbers between major hubs, the Dreamliner is targeted at smaller airports where Boeing predicts will be an area of growth in the industry.
Earlier in the day, Boeing received a congratulatory letter from Airbus.
The company president and CEO Louis Gallois said, "Today is a great day in aviation history.
For, whenever such a milestone is reached in our industry, it always is a reflection of hard work by dedicated people inspired by the wonder of flight.
Even if tomorrow Airbus will get back to the business of competing vigorously, today is Boeing's day -- a day to celebrate the 787."
China Eastern Airlines to purchase twenty new Airbus A320 jets
June 18, 2009
China Eastern Airlines stated on Thursday that it had signed a contract to purchase a score of Airbus A320 passenger jets for 9.9 billion yuan (about US$1.4 billion).
The airline, which is the third largest in China, signed the agreement in Paris on June 15.
The company said that the planes would meet additional demand for domestic passenger routes.
The deal was approved unanimously by China Eastern's board of directors.
The China Daily newspaper reported that the deal is waiting for an approval by Chinese aviation authorities.
The planes are expected to start delivering in 2011 and end two years later.
The Airbus A320 is a single-aisle airplane, and Airbus' best selling jet.
It can seat up to 150 people and is used primarily for medium- and short-haul routes.
Chinese airlines agree purchase of Boeing 787 Dreamliners worth US$7.2bn
January 29, 2005
Officials from the People's Republic of China have agreed to purchase 60 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in a deal worth US$7.2bn.
In China, airliners are selected and purchased by the government, which then distributes them to different airlines.
The preliminary agreement will see Dreamliners delivered to six airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Shanghai Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.
The deliveries are scheduled to be in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
The aircraft was once named the 7E7 but was renamed at the same time the deal was announced.
Boeing will begin production in 2006 and the aircraft should enter airline service in 2008.
It will seat 200 to 300 people and will have a range of 3,500 to 8,500 nautical miles.
Through the use of the latest materials and designs it will be 20% more fuel efficient than the equivalent aircraft today.
Engine troubles delay Airbus superjumbo tour
November 5, 2005
The departure from France of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo airliner on a tour of Asia and Australia has been delayed, leading to a rearrangement of its public appearances.
Citing "a precautionary measure", Airbus announced that two of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on the prototype airliner would be replaced before the tour commenced.
Singapore will remain the airliner's first stop, where Singapore Airlines will display the aircraft they intend to launch into passenger-carrying service in November 2006.
It is expected that the Airbus 380 will wear the livery of Singapore Airlines when it arrives on November 11, three days later than originally planned.
The massive airliner will then bypass the planned stop in Malaysia, and fly directly to Sydney, then Melbourne and Brisbane as part of the leadup to Qantas' 85th birthday celebrations on November 16.
Qantas plans to commence A380 operations starting in April 2007.
The Malaysia visit will be rescheduled for November 17, occurring during the return flight to France.
It is unclear whether the originally planned Australian tour dates can be kept, and sources indicate that the airliner's first stop in Brisbane, on November 11, maybe eliminated in favour of a brief appearance on November 16.
First A380 enters commercial service
October 17, 2007
It was a milestone in aviation history: the first Airbus A380 landed at Singapore's Changi International Airport at 6:40 p.m. (GMT+8) after a 12-hour flight from Airbus' Delivery Center.
The aircraft was greeted by some 400 guests, including the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong, at the soon-to-open Terminal 3 of Changi International Airport.
In his speech, the Prime Minister applauded Singapore Airlines (SIA) - the recipient carrier - and cited its success as a source of pride for all Singaporeans.
He also said that the landing was a milestone not only for SIA, but also for Changi International Airport, the country's main airport.
All existing terminals are currently A380-ready, and the SGD1.75-billion Terminal 3 will open its doors in January next year.
The A380 will make a special charity flight on October 25 from Singapore to Sydney and will begin regular service on the Singapore-Sydney route on October 28.
First Airbus A380 delivered
October 15, 2007
The first A380 superjumbo, made by Airbus, was delivered today to Singapore Airlines (SIA) 18 months behind schedule.
After the plane was delivered in Singapore, it was flown to Toulouse, France for the ceremony of about 500 guests.
The plane is built with four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines.
The first flight will take off for a "special charity-flight" from Singapore and land in Sydney on October 25.
Special services will continue from October 28.
"This is a major milestone for the A380 programme, and I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all parties concerned.
I want to thank our teams and all those who worked hard, days, nights, and week-ends, for their dedication and commitment," said Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Enders.
Government Accountability Office requests rerun of US Air Force tanker bid
July 2, 2008
The Government Accountability Office on June 18 called for a re-run of the bidding for the U.S. Air Force $40 billion tanker contract, citing major flaws in the procurement process.
This imperils the Northrop Grumman and EADS North America plan to assemble the planes in Mobile, Alabama.
When the Air Force selected Los Angeles based Northrop Grumman on February 29 to build the aircraft, Boeing challenged the award in a formal protest before the GAO, claiming the evaluation was skewed towards Northrop.
The GAO upheld Boeing's protest, though not all of their individual claims were upheld.
"Our review of the record led us to conclude that the Air Force had made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman," said Michael R. Golden, the GAO's managing associate general counsel for procurement law.
The GAO issued a non-binding recommendation that the Air Force re-open the competition, allow the competitors to submit revised bids, and completely re-evaluate the new bids.
This process could take a year or more to complete.
The Air Force has 60 days to respond to the GAO.
Indonesia's transport minister tells airlines not to buy European aircraft due to EU ban
December 20, 2007
Jusman Syafii Djamal, minister of transport for Indonesia, has recommended that local airlines should not purchase aircraft from European manufacturers, such as Airbus.
It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union (EU) to add all 51 of Indonesia's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.
The EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country, including two major disasters this year - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which killed 102 and 21 people respectively.
"We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked," Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying, although Xinhua translated the quote as: "As long as the ban is still in place, it is better we do not buy [aircraft] from Europe."
"If aircraft are purchased and registered as Indonesian [in Europe], we are worried the planes won't be able to fly to Indonesia because Indonesian airlines' aircraft are banned from flying over Europe," he continued.
Djamal is concerned that instead new European planes would have to be flown into Indonesia prior to registration, with higher costs incurred as a result.
The announcement, which had already been issued to airlines two weeks ago, was made at a joint press conference with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla in Jakarta.
Djamal told reporters that he felt the best option was the lifting of the ban.
"The easiest way is to lift the ban, because the ban goes against the principle of open sky policy," he said.
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has already postponed a diplomatic visit to Europe, citing the ban as his reason.
Normally, the president flies on an aircraft operated by state-owned national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia.
A European Commission review was held in Brussels on November 28.
Although bans were lifted on Pakistani flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines and Surinam carrier Blue Wing Airlines, the sanctions on Indonesian airlines remained in force.
Multiple local air carriers are considering the possibility of fleet expansions, with some evaluating Airbus jets as possible options.
Airbus, in particular, charge an added cost for taking an aircraft to Indonesia for registration.
"There is an additional cost that must be paid by Indonesian airlines that buy the (Airbus) plane from Europe, US$200,000 ," said Djamal.
"Because of that we recommend not buying planes from Europe.
As long as the EU ban is still in place, there will be additional payment."
However, he went on to say that should a manufacturer be willing to pay the cost itself, he did not object to the purchase of the aircraft.
He has also confirmed that no Indonesian officers will be sent to Europe to assist with the situation.
Internal emails expose Boeing-Air Force contract discussions
November 24, 2004
Emails exchanged among United States Air Force officials regarding a USD$23 billion dollar deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing have been entered into the public record.
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) entered them into the Congressional Record during a speech last week against the now-cancelled deal to lease 100 mid-air tanker aircraft from Boeing.
Congressional lawmakers rejected the proposal in October, although industry experts say the deal had been killed by the Pentagon because of reports stating that the deal had favored Boeing.
Senator McCain has been the deal's most vocal critic.
The original negotiations with Boeing were over a no-bid contract.
Such contracts are often justified by the speed they offer, eliminating a preliminary bid and selection round that may last months.
However, no-bid contracts are only open to the company selected by the procuring agency.
This leaves no-bid contracts open to accusations of conflicts of interest among the procurement personnel.
Such accusations have previously been leveled against Vice President Dick Cheney for a no-bid contract to Halliburton, and are now being made against senior Air Force officials for choosing Boeing to replace its tanker fleet.
In the released emails, Air Force officials responsible for the awarding of contracts appear biased against Boeing's main competitor, Airbus and its CEO Ralph Crosby.
Airbus is owned by European Aeronautic Defense & Space Company (EADS).
Airbus manufacturers a number of passenger and military aircraft and has gained market share in passenger aircraft over Boeing in recent years.
The following is a sequential email exchange regarding Airbus as recorded in the Congressional Record:
:Special Asst. to the Secretary and Director of Air Force Communications Bill Bodie: "We don't have to turn the other cheek, you know.
I'm ready to tell the truth about Airbus's boom, footprint, and financial shortcoming.
But maybe we should sleep on it."
:Secretary of the Air Force James Roche: "No, Sir, save it and blow him away.
He admits that they were not technically qualified!
And, we keep their record of bribes as our trump card!
Jim."
:Civilian Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Darleen Druyun: "I read with disgust the article on Airbus tankers from the new EADS CEO of North America.
What BS . . . should not have been surprised at the slime . . . his day of reckoning will come hopefully."
:Secretary of the Air Force James Roche: "Oy.
I agree.
I had hoped you would have stayed and tortured him slowly over the next few years until EADS got rid of him!
Jim."
An email from Burkhardt & Associates to James Roche advises the Secretary to release fiscal numbers favorable to Boeing, apparently regardless of the facts: "I'd distribute a one page memo saying the per plane cost of the lease will not be greater than x and have x be less than the last lease Boeing did for some commercial entity--or that x is y dollars less than the cost of a new tanker," it said.
An additional email by Roche provides a stark contrast to his criticism of Airbus, as he talks to Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Marvin Sambur about Boeing, saying, "I love Ya, Big Guy.
Give it to the Blue Eyed Arabs of the North (the expression we used for Boeing)."
GovExec.com quotes a "Senate aide" as saying: "The House language [of the spending bill] ignores an analysis of alternatives called for in last year's authorizing language and by Pentagon Acquisition Director Michael Wynne and the DSB.
It precludes such an analysis and predetermines the outcome in favor of the Boeing 767 before the study is even initiated."
The activist organization the Project on Government Oversight has called it "a textbook case of favoritism to a single defense contractor."
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Marvin Sambur defended the Air Force's exclusive consideration of Boeing, saying, "This was not a competitive bid process.
The Air Force was ordered by Congress to work with Boeing on the new tanker program."
Boeing had previously hired Civilian Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Darleen Druyun.
This caused a controversy over conflict of interest and led to felony charges against Boeing Chief Financial Officer Michael Sears for illegally hiring her.
Former military personnel are often hired by defense contractors to lobby for contracts.
Days after Sen. McCain's remarks, the Air Force said the tanker replacement contract would be revived as an open bid.
Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz published an open-article in the Congressional Record, saying: "After we have selected an appropriate alternative, we intend to require competition."
Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent EADS defeat Boeing for $40 billion US airtanker contract
March 1, 2008
Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent company European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company EADS N.V. (EADS) have unexpectedly defeated Boeing for a US$40 billion (GB£20.1 billion) contract to supply the United States Air Force (USAF) with 179 new aerial refueling tankers at a rate of 15 a year.
It is the biggest contract of its kind since the Joint Strike Fighter program.
That contract was fought for between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Lockheed ultimately winning the contest.
JSA Research defence analysist Paul Nesbit said that Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) operations across the aircraft's fifty-year service life could push the value of the contract as high as US$100 billion.
Northrop Grumman CEO Ron Sugar said in an interview "Everyone told us we were crazy, that we had no chance.
But we took a big swing and in this case, we hit a home run."
USAF officials said that the contract had been awarded based on competence, track record and competitive pricing, with UBS analyst David Strauss saying "The key decision was the amount of fuel the bigger plane could carry.
In the armed services, you can never have too much gas in the air."
USAF also denied that creating jobs in the US was a factor; job supply had been the reason Boeing were expected to win, with the airframer promising 44,000 new positions at 300 suppliers in 40 states.
The Northrop Grumman KC-45 tankers - more often known as KC-30s - are based on the Airbus A330 MRTT.
The first four aircraft will be assembled at the main Airbus factory in Toulouse, France but by 2010-11 production of the remainder will be carried out at a facility in Mobile, Alabama.
This is thought likely to create 1,500 to 2,000 jobs and support 25,000 others.
60% of the parts will be supplied by domestic manufacturers.
EADS had previously announced plans to shift much production to the US due to the current weakness of the dollar.
General Arthur Lichte, head of USAF's Mobility Command, said it is hoped the first aircraft can be tested in 2010 and in operation three years afterwards.
USAF's chief of staff General Duncan McNab stated "The tanker is the number-one procurement priority for us right now.
It is the first step in our critical commitment to recapitalize our aging fleet to move, supply, and position assets anywhere."
There is still a possibility of Boeing challenging the decision; Boeing themselves were successfuly challenged by Lockheed and Sikorsky in 2006 over a US$10 billion contract to supply search and rescue helicopters to the Pentagon.
A statement by Boeing given by Boeing spokesman William Barksdale said “Obviously we are very disappointed...
Once we have reviewed the details behind the award, we will make a decision concerning our possible options.”
Washington senator Patty Murray, who hails from the same state where Boeing bases their commercial airliner operations, said in a critical statement "We are shocked that the Air Force tapped a European company and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our American military.
At a time when our economy is hurting, this decision to outsource our tankers is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America's military."
Washington representative Norm Dicks said he too was "shocked", releasing a statement saying "This decision is even more disappointing because the Air Force had previously favored the Boeing 767 tanker and we were prepared to move forward with the production of 100 tankers in 2003, before the process was halted due to the Boeing scandal.
I regret that it has taken so long to respond to what was—and is—an urgent need to replace these older aircraft.
And even more regrettable is the decision to award the contract to Airbus, which has consistently used unfair European government subsidies to take jobs away from American aircraft workers."
Kansas senator Sam Brownback said "It's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to Europe instead of building them in America.
I'll be calling upon the Secretary of Defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by Boeing."
Todd Tiahrt, a Kansas representative, said "We should have an American tanker built by an American company with American workers.
I cannot believe we would create French jobs in place of Kansas jobs."
A group of Washington politicians released a joint statement saying "We will be asking tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract...
At a time when our economy is hurting, this is a blow not only to our state, but more than 40 states across the country who would help build this national plane."
Alabama Governor Bob Riley said "To say this is a great day for Alabama is a monumental understatement.
This will go down in history as one of our greatest days."
Ralph Crosby, EADS's North America CEO and ex Northrop executive commented the business has "committed our full resources to support this vital program for our prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, the Air Force, and the war fighters that this system will serve for decades to come.
We already have begun the work necessary to expand our U.S. industrial footprint in support of this important program."
EADS chief executive Louis Gallois commented “This major selection is a win-win for our customers, for allied industrial cooperation and for EADS.
It signals a quantum-leap forward in our commitment to the US defence customer, reflects and supports our global strategy to increase EADS’s industrial presence in key markets and our goal to balance the company’s defence and commercial portfolios.”
General Arthur Lichte said “This will be an American tanker, flown by American airmen with an American flag on its tail and, every day, it will be saving American lives.
Boeing had initially agreed to lease 100 tankers, but in 2003 a scandal erupted when it emerged that Boeing executive Michael M. Sears arranged a job for USAF official Darleen Druyun while negotiations were still underway.
Both served jail sentences for corruption charges and a competition was opened up to award a new contract.
Ryanair exercises options on five Boeing 737s
June 13, 2005
Irish low cost airline, Ryanair, announced today that it is exercising its options with Boeing to purchase five new 737 aircraft.
This brings Ryanair's total number of outstanding orders with the US manufacturer to 230.
The new planes, which come from the 737-800 range, will be fitted with blended winglets to boost fuel efficiency by as much as 3%.
Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, justified his choice of Boeing by saying, "The Boeing 737-800 has the best technical reliability and ensures that Ryanair is the number one on-time major airline in Europe"..."In addition, it has the lowest unit operating cost.
The addition of these five aircraft will continue to enable us to develop more new routes across Europe and bring low fares to many more European consumers."
Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years.
At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 on order.
Singapore Airlines to be compensated for A380 delays
October 5, 2006
Singapore Airlines says that it will be compensated by Airbus for the additional delay in delivery of its new superjumbo A380's.
The double-deck commercial aircrafts' delivery, originally due later this year, will be delayed until October 2007.
The main fault has been found to be problems in the aircraft's 500km of wiring.
In a statement on the Airbus website, the company said that "the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital mock-up, which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation, was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve".
Airbus is currently two years behind schedule.
In a statement, SIA said that, "The delays are disappointing; all the more so because the flight test and certification programme is proceeding well, and the delays are down to production issues."
Analysts are predicting that the compensations could well run into a few hundred million US dollars.
SIA has stated that the compensation details will be kept confidential
Singapore Airlines is the first airline to fly the A380 and will be receiving the first four aircraft.
Technical problem on Airbus A400M maiden flight
January 25, 2010
Airbus has confirmed that there was a software glitch on its Airbus A400M military transplort plane's maiden flight.
The problem was relatively minor, and affected the software controlling its engines.
The glitch was not reported when the plane made its maiden flight on 11 December—four years behind schedule and $7.3 billion over budget, due to what the manufacturers call "political interference"—and only became public attention this weekend, when German magazine Der Spiegel cited confidential documents from engine maker Europrop in a report.
The steering computer and backup system failed after thirty minutes.
The issue has been resolved, according to Airbus spokesman Jaime Perez-Guerra.
Apparently, the glitch led the pilots to disengage an engine, allowing its blades to turn freely.
Since then, he says, the plane has flown for nearly thirty hours and is exceeding expectations.
However, additional costs were involved, and European aerospace contractor EADS wants this cost to be shouldered by the seven customer nations: Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
Airbus has asked that a decision on how the project is to procced be made before the end of the month.
World's largest passenger airliner makes first flight
April 27, 2005
The world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, has made its maiden flight after lifting off from Toulouse in France.
The take-off, at 08:30 UTC, was apparently normal and took place exactly on time.
The aircraft flew into clear blue skies with a flight crew of six (all wearing parachutes as a safety precaution) and twenty tonnes of test equipment on board.
Around 50,000 people watched the maiden flight, many sitting on grass banks lining the runway.
More people watched the flight on a giant screen erected in the centre of Toulouse.
The test flight lasted four hours, with the aircraft flying no higher than 10,000 nor further than 100 miles from Toulouse as it circled the Bay of Biscay.
The A380, known for many years during its development phase as the Airbus A3XX, will be the largest airliner in the world by a substantial margin when it enters service.
The first A380 prototype was unveiled during a lavish ceremony in Toulouse, France, on January 18, 2005.
Its manufacturer's serial number is 001, and it is registered F-WWOW.
The new Airbus will initially be sold in two versions: the A380-800, a full double-decker configuration, able to carry 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or up to 800 passengers in a single-class economy configuration.
Range for the A380-800 model is expected to be 8,000 nautical miles (14,800 km).
The second model, the A380-800F dedicated freighter, will carry 150 tons of cargo 5,600 miles (10,400 km).
The cost of the project so far is £8.4bn, £1bn over budget.
144 planes have already been ordered.
Singapore Airlines, which will be the first company to operate the new air giant, in July 2006, have opened a reservation site for this first regular flight.
Apple announces Mac OS X Lion, iOS 5, and iCloud
June 7, 2011
At the company's own Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote at the Moscone West center in San Francisco, Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the next generation of software products from Apple.
Apple unveiled Lion, the new version of their Mac OS X operating system for desktop and laptop computers that brings new features to the software.
They also demonstrated iOS 5, a new version of the operating system that powers iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads.
Alongside both announcements, Jobs also announced a new iCloud service to sync data among all devices.
All 5,200 participating developers will spend the rest of the week in workshops with Apple employees; developer releases of each product were made available today.
Mac OS X Lion will be shipped in July through the online Mac App Store available on Mac computers for US$29.
According to Apple, the update adds over 250 new features to the OS.
Employee Phil Schiller discussed new multitouch gestures along with a dynamic task manager named Mission Control that shows open applications.
During the keynote, Schiller said, "The Mac has outpaced the PC industry every quarter for five years running and with OS X Lion we plan to keep extending our lead."
It also adds full support for the Mac port of the popular App Store, full screen applications, iOS-style app icon lists called Launchpad, and other iOS-like features including a revamped Mail and Auto Save among others.
Mac OS X Lion was announced at a different Apple event several months ago and will replace Mac OS X Snow Leopard, which was released in 2009.
Soon after, the company also introduced the latest installment in its popular mobile operating system iOS.
The fifth version (iOS 5) introduces around 200 new features, including a revamped notification system, which combines messages and notifications from all applications installed on the user's device.
Scott Forestall, an Apple employee, also revealed that iOS devices would no longer require a computer for setup, allowing users to 'cut the cord' between their devices and PCs.
Magazines and newspapers also have a new folder interface; the Twitter social network is now integrated significantly into iOS devices.
Improvements to the mobile Safari browser were also announced; tabbed browsing and a Reader feature introduce desktop-like functionality.
Finally, new camera features are built in, including the ability to take snapshots from the lock screen, as well as iMessages, a new messaging platform for iPhones and iPads.
CEO Steve Jobs returned to the stage to reveal Apple's new cloud services offering, iCloud.
The service integrates with Lion and iOS applications and syncs data between a user's iOS devices.
For example, calendar events created on a user's laptop would be sent to their iPhone through iCloud.
Apps, books, documents, photos, and more purchased or created on one device will be shared with others.
The service is intended to launch in the fall of 2011 alongside iOS 5 and will be available with 5 gigabytes (GB) of storage for 10 devices for free.
Earlier this year, Apple opened a 500,000 square foot data center in North Carolina intended to facilitate this new service.
Jobs rounded the services off by unveiling a new iTunes feature that mirrors a user's library in the cloud, allowing them to listen and download music to authorized devices.
"We are going to demote the PC to just be a device.
We are going to move the digital hub, the center of your digital life, into the cloud,” said Steve Jobs during the keynote. 
iCloud and iOS 5 will be released in the fall of 2011; Apple announced no new hardware products.
Apple announces new iPod range
September 5, 2007
Apple have released several re-designs of their popular iPod range.
In addition to the iPod Classic, Nano and Shuffle, they have announced the brand new iPod touch, a media player which mimics the iPhone's touch-screen capabilities.
The new iPod Classic design features a larger memory space of up to 160GB or 40,000 songs, and has a new all-metal design.
The iPod nano is now smaller and squarer, adding video playback to its features for the first time.
The 4GB model is cheaper than its predecessor at $149/£99, but the 8GB is available in five colours at $199/£129.
The iPod Shuffle is identical in design to the previous model, but is now available in a new range of five colours, with the same price of $79/£49.
The iPod touch also features in-built wi-fi technology, enabling users to access the internet and download music from Apple's market-leading on line iTunes music store to their handset.
It was announced that Starbucks would offer free wi-fi access to all users of the iPod touch in its cafes.
The screen layout, similar to that of the iPhone, offers access to music, video, photos and the iTunes store.
There are currently two models, at 8GB and 16GB of memory capacity.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs also announced that the price of Apple's iPhone, currently only on sale in the US, will be cut by $200 to $399.
He described the new iPod range as 'one of the seven wonders of the world'.
Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs gives opening keynote to WWDC 2005
June 6, 2005
Apple Computer CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs gave his annual opening keynote to the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) at Moscone Center in San Francisco, California on Monday.
He announced a seamless integration of podcasting with iTunes, and, to the amazement of many, that future Apple Macintosh computers will feature Intel processors.
Jobs welcomed everyone to the event and announced that there were 3,800 attendees.
There are 500 Apple engineers at what is their largest developers conference in the past decade.
There are over 500,000 developers of Apple programs (apps).
Jobs said that Apple has 109 retail stores, with one million visitors per week, creating over $500 million yearly in revenue.
The Mac market share is up 82% from 9 months ago.
Jobs then moved on to talk about a very anticipated announcement- Podcasting.
Steve called podcasting “Wayne’s World for radio”.
He called it the “hottest thing going in radio”, and, “exciting”.
There are over 8,000 podcasts.
Steve Jobs announced that automatic podcasting subscription would be built in to iTunes and iPod seamlessly.
He also announced that QuickTime 7 would be soon available for Windows.
Moving on, Jobs announced that there have been 2 million copies of Tiger sold in the 6 weeks that it has been available.
He demoed the Wikipedia Dashboard widget.
Steve announced that Mac OS X Leopard would be released in 2007, the same time as Microsoft’s Longhorn.
In a surprising move, Steve Jobs announced that Macintosh computers would begin to be shipped with Intel processors, the same as in Windows machines, ending the eleven year partnership with IBM and Motorola.
This is said to be out of Apple's increasing frustration at IBM's inability to deliver faster and cooler processors, though it is interesting to note that Intel has recently added Digital Rights/Restrictions Management (DRM) to its latest processors.
This 'switch', he said, would happen beginning next year.
Jobs said that Mac OS X has had “a secret double life” and OS X had “been compiled [for Intel processors] for five years.”
He talked about the easiness for developers to port their Mac apps to Intel (x86) processors.
Current PowerPC programs can be run on Intel processors due to a new Apple technology.
He said that Apple is “getting ready” for the transition from PowerPC to Intel.
Apple Corps loses court case against Apple Computer
May 8, 2006
The Beatles' label Apple Corps lost its court case against Apple Computer today in the High Court.
Apple Corps argued that the iTunes Music Store was a breach of the 1991 settlement reached between the two parties.
The 1991 agreement was that Apple Computer would not sell music branded with an apple.
Mr Justice Anthony Mann agreed with Apple Computer's defence that, while the iTunes Music Store is branded, the music it sells is not - "I conclude that the use of the Apple logo ... does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work."
During the case Apple Corps showed the court just how many times the Apple Computer logo appeared during a typical download.
The song purchased during the demonstration was Le Freak by Chic.
After the case closed Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs extended an invitation to the record label, "we have always loved the Beatles, and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store".
Apple Corps have decided to take the case to the Court of Appeal.
Speaking for Apple Corps, manager Neil Aspinall said, "with great respect to the trial judge, we consider he has reached the wrong conclusion."
Apple Inc., Apple Corps resolve trademark dispute
February 6, 2007
Apple Inc. announced Monday it has settled its decades-long trademark dispute with the Beatles' record company, Apple Corps.
Under this new agreement, Apple Inc. will own all Apple trademarks and will license some to Apple Corps, and will continue to use its name and logo on its iTunes music service.
This new settlement replaces the 1991 agreement between the two companies, which defined the context in which the two companies could use the Apple trademark.
"We love the Beatles, and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks," said Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs.
"It feels great to resolve this in a positive manner, and in a way that should remove the potential of further disagreements in the future."
"The years ahead are going to be very exciting times for us," said Neil Aspinall, manager of Apple Corps.
"We wish Apple Inc. every success and look forward to many years of peaceful co-operation with them."
It was not disclosed whether the Beatles' music catalog was part of the deal.
Apple executive leaves company after iPhone 4 antenna issues
August 9, 2010
Mark Papermaster, formerly an Apple Inc. executive overseeing hardware engineering for the company's iPhone, is stepping down from his post.
The move came after Apple received criticism last month for the placement of the antenna on their most recent iPhone model, iPhone 4.
Apple confirmed that Papermaster, 49, had left the company, but did not say whether he decided to leave or was forced out.
Papermaster did not comment on the situation.
According to The New York Times, who first broke the news about Papermaster's departure, an anonymous individual "with direct knowledge of the situation" claimed that the former executive had been ousted over various hardware issues, some related to the iPod Touch.
When Apple CEO Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone 4, he praised the device's antenna design.
However, many consumers reported that, when holding the phone in a certain location, reception would decrease and sometimes lead to dropped calls.
Apple's response to the issue, dubbed "Antennagate" by the media, was first to recommend holding the phone in a different location.
They later found a related software glitch that caused the signal strength to be misreported on the device.
In a July 16 press conference, Jobs said that all iPhone 4 buyers would be eligible to receive a free case, or "bumper," which alleviates the signal problem.
Citing people familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal reported that Papermaster had been pushed out due to an incompatibility with Apple's corporate culture.
The sources claimed that Papermaster was not used to the environment or corporate politics and did not possess the creativity the company wanted to see.
They also said that it was Jobs, not Papermaster, who made the decision to proceed with iPhone 4 development even though the company had been aware of potential signal problems resulting from the antenna placement as early as a year ago.
Papermaster's post will be filled by Bob Mansfield, Apple's senior vice president for Macintosh engineering.
Mansfield was already involved in iPhone development, overseeing processor and display engineering.
Papermaster had been with Apple since November 2008, but a United States federal judge barred him from working until April 2009.
He had previously held a senior position with IBM, where he had worked for 25 years.
IBM sued Papermaster in an attempt to block him from joining Apple, but a settlement was reached after he testified that no IBM corporate secrets had been disclosed to Apple.
Apple executive Steve Jobs resigns
August 25, 2011
Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, has chosen to step down from his post as CEO of the company.
The former Chief Operating Officer, Tim Cook will be succeeding Jobs as CEO.
Jobs resigned in a letter to Apple's board of directors stating, "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know.
Unfortunately, that day has come."
In that same letter, Jobs stated that his desire was to remain as chairman of the board.
Steve Jobs has been fighting pancreatic cancer since 2004 and has been on medical leave since January of this year.
This was Jobs' third period of medical leave.
He briefly made an appearance in March and June to unveil the iPad 2 and the iCloud, an online cloud computing service.
In part of his resignation, Jobs left this farewell, "I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you."
Tim Cook was personally recommended by Jobs to take over as CEO and has been serving as interim CEO since the beginning of Jobs' medical leave.
He is known for staying out of the spotlight.
Due to an operational overhaul by Cook, he is credited with the success of the iPad and MacBook Air.
He also stood in Steve Jobs' place while the CEO underwent liver transplant surgery.
He received $59 million for his performance in the position.
Analyst Charles Golvin predicts that the resignation will not begin to affect Apple performance for 1.5 to 2 years.
Many of the new products are already under development and Jobs will continue to steer the company from his position as chairman of the board.
Art Levinson, chairman of Genentech and a member of the board, adds, "Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration".
A contrary view is offered by Charles O'Reilly, a management expert at Stanford University, who stated, "Great companies rarely go from strength to strength".
Richard Doherty attributes Steve Jobs' success as the ability to hold off on a product until it is perfect.
He states "A lot of products could have gotten to market earlier, but he wanted it better."
In light of the revelation, Apple shares (AAPL) slid $19.37 in after hours trading—a drop of over 5%.
Since market open, Apple shares rose to $373.72, a drop of only $2.46 since Wednesday's close.
Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs on medical leave
January 17, 2011
Steve Jobs, the chief executive officer of Apple Inc., announced Monday in an internal memo that he would be on medical leave for an undetermined period of time.
The statement caused a sharp decrease of Apple share prices in foreign markets, while US markets were closed in honor of Martin Luther King.
Monday's email announcement marked the third time in the past decade that Jobs, aged 55, has taken medical leave.
He fought pancreatic cancer in 2004 and took six months off in early 2009, later revealing he had undergone a liver transplant.
Jobs has not yet mentioned what prompted his decision this time around, but said he will still be the company's CEO.
He left current chief operating officer Timothy D. Cook in charge of day-to-day operations, the same move made in Jobs' last two absences.
While no additional comment has been officially made by Apple, The New York Times reported that someone familiar with the situation said Jobs's health has "ups and downs" due to problems with his immune system, problems frequently experienced by those who have had liver transplants.
The insider, who asked to remain anonymous, said that, over the past few weeks, Jobs' health appeared to be deteriorating and that he was becoming thinner.
Lewis W. Teperman, a doctor at New York University, said, "It’s very common for transplant patients to have issues that are not life-threatening."
On its website, Apple released the text of Jobs's email, which reads: Team, at my request, the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence so I can focus on my health.
I will continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company.
I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for all of Apple's day to day operations.
I have great confidence that Tim and the rest of the executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we have in place for 2011.
I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can.
In the meantime, my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy.
Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs dies aged 56
October 6, 2011
The co-founder and former chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Steve Jobs has died yesterday at the age of 56, according to the company website.
On August 24, Jobs resigned from his post as CEO.
He has been fighting pancreatic cancer since 2004.
Jobs, born in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, has built the most valuable technology company in the world, with a market value of $348.8 billion.
He started Apple in 1976, and in 1984 the first Macintosh personal computer was released to the public.
One year later he was fired from the company and he founded NeXT.
In 1986 he bought Pixar which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2005.
In 1996, following Apple Computer's purchase of NeXT, Jobs returned to Apple and soon after reassumed the role of CEO.
In 1998 Apple introduced the iMac personal computer, in 2001 the iPod music player and the following year the Mac OS X operating system was released.
2007 was the year of the iPhone smartphone, then the iPad tablet computer in 2010.
A statement on Apple's website, the homepage of which currently displays a black and white photograph and the text "Steve Jobs 1955-2011", states: “Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being.
Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor.
Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.”
United States President Barack Obama said "Steve was among the greatest of American innovators — brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it".
Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates responded to Jobs' death with a statement on his blog: "The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. ...
I will miss Steve immensely."
The current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer also expressed condolences for Jobs and described him as "one of the founders of our industry and a true visionary".
Apple Inc. doubled its profits
January 18, 2007
The American computer company Apple has reached 78 percent increase in its profits during the last quarter, which ended December 30, 2006.
This fact is explained by great demand enjoyed by Apple's iPod digital music players during the Christmas and New Year sales period.
As a result of successful Christmas sales, the very beginning of the financial year marked a double increase of the Apple's sales if compared to the $ 565 million profit reaped during the same period of the last year.
The company gained the record-breaking $ 1 billion.
The overall annual revenue of the company made up $ 7.1 billion in 2006, having boosted from $5.8 billion in 2005.
The company's revenue growth is partially explained by the fact that the laptops produced by Apple are also found among the bestsellers.
Even the Wall Street experts have not broadcasted such remarkable results for the Apple computer company.
Apple's results were way ahead of market expectations.
Its net profit has made up $1.14 per share, while Wall Street expected just 77 cents.
During the first quarter of the financial year Apple Inc. sold more than 21 million iPod players and about 1.6 million computers - it implies the respective growth of 28% and 50% again compared to the previous year.
As soon as the results were announced at the New York Stock Exchange, the shares of the American computer company increased by 5 percent.
It should be mentioned that the stock capital of Apple Inc tripled in 2004, doubled in 2005 and increased by 16 percent in 2006.
The steady growth is also due to considerable sales of its iPods and computers.
Last week the company presented the iPhone.
Apple introduces iPhone and Apple TV
January 10, 2007
Apple Inc. today has introduced the much-anticipated iPhone at the Macworld Conference in San Francisco.
The iPhone is claimed to be "a revolutionary mobile phone" as stated on the Apple website.
The device appears to be running a mobile version of the Apple operating system Mac OSX.
It is approximately the same size as a 5th generation iPod, it has a 3.5-inch LCD touchscreen display that is used to access all features of the phone including number dial, as well as making phone calls.
The iPhone plays music, movies, displays pictures and is able to connect to a wireless network.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device by walking onto the stage and taking the iPhone out of his jeans pocket.
During his 2 hour speech he stated that "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, We are going to make history today".
Today Apple also released their Media Center device - Apple TV.
It will directly compete with Microsoft's Media Center operating system.
Apple has taken a different approach to the media center market; rather than storing content (such as movies, music and photos) on the device, Apple TV connects to a computer (Mac and Windows) over a wirless network connection and plays all content stored on that computer.
This makes it substantially easier for users to organize their media content.
Apple introduces new iPod with video playback capabilities
October 13, 2005
On Wednesday, Apple introduced an iPod capable of displaying video, as well as a new video section to the iTunes music store.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs believes that this may have a large impact on the film industry, in a similar fashion to that of the impact on the music industry when the iPod first was released.
The new iPod comes in a 30GB edition and a 60GB edition for US$299 and US$399, respectively.
On the 30GB iPod, 75 hours of video at a resolution of 320x240 can be stored, and on the 60GB iPod, 150 hours can be stored.
Despite these features, people claim that the screen may be too small for people to enjoy.
However, iPod owners will be able to purchase an optional S-Video cable for playing video from their iPod on a television.
To help complement the new video section, Apple and ABC have agreed to a deal in which episodes of television programs such as Lost and Desperate Housewives will be available the day after airing for $1.99 per episode.
Other plans for the video section involve the animation company Pixar, which was founded by current Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
There are also plans to distribute content from Disney, Pixar's distributor and owner of ABC.
In addition, music videos will also be available at the on-line music store for $1.99 each.
Apple launches 3G iPhone
June 9, 2008
Apple Computer today launched a 3G version of its iPhone device.
Steve Jobs, the Apple Chief Executive Officer, announced the development at a developers' conference, where he promoted the iPhone by saying that, “just one year after launching the iPhone, we’re launching the new iPhone 3G that is twice as fast at half the price.”
Apple has claimed that the 3G iPhone will provide internet access at double the speed of the internet access provided by the previous versions.
The price for the iPhone has also been reduced to $199 in the US, with prices in other countries equal or below that of within the US.
For several months there has been speculation among Apple fans about the launch of a 3G iPhone.
Apple launches new, faster iPhone
June 9, 2009
Apple Computer today announced its latest iteration of their popular iPhone, the iPhone 3G S. 
The new hardware, revealed at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference drew attention from the media and iPhone owners alike.
Features new to the iPhone include an upgraded camera, which also allows users to record video and sound, as well as "voice control", which will allow users to control most features of the iPhone with their voice.
The new phone will also come pre-loaded with the new iPhone 3.0 software, which will be available on June 17, two days before the phone launches.
In addition to the new iPhone hardware, Apple also demonstrated some of the features of its new desktop operating system, Snow Leopard, and highlighted the new Safari 4.0 web browser.
The iPhone 3G S will be available in a 16 GB and 32 GB models, retailing for US$199 and $299 respectively.
Apple plans another special event
October 4, 2005
Within one month of the iPod nano and iTunes phone special event, Apple Computer announced today another special event to be held on October 12.
It is to be held at the California Theater in downtown San Jose, California.
The invitation reads, "One more thing...", the teasing tagline of Steve Jobs.
The words were atop a picture of closed theater curtains.
Recently Apple has been gaining rights to sell music videos from record labels.
This has increased rumors of a video iPod(vPod) along with this event.
AppleInsider is claiming that there are sources that have seen the new iPod.
Alongside this rumor, AppleInsider claims to have seen a wireless device similar to Apple's Airport Express that supports video.
Other rumors for this event include a major iTunes Music Store update and a Macintosh with a Intel processor.
Apple plans to sell movies on iTunes
June 20, 2006
Apple Computer is planning to sell full-length feature films for download via the online iTunes Music Store.
The store currently sells digital music tracks, and more recently has begun to sell TV episodes.
Apple executives are in negotiations with film studios to arrange the deal and settle on pricing structures.
It is expected that films will retail for around $9.99 US dollars, although some studios are reported to want to set a higher price.
iTunes is currently by the biggest online retailer of digital music, with its software tightly integrated with the popular iPod line of products.
Newer versions of the iPod include a colour screen capable of displaying videos, and so consumers could watch the films on the devices, but it is not yet clear how many people will want to do this.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs is also the largest single shareholder of Disney, which now owns animation studio Pixar, however he could end up playing a wider role within the film industry if iTunes becomes the dominant online distributor.
A full-length TV movie, 'High School Musical' from Disney, is already available on iTunes, suggesting that the technical infrastructure is already in place.
Apple releases iPhone SDK, announces upcoming update
March 6, 2008
During a media event held at its Cupertino headquarters, Apple released the long awaited iPhones Software Development Kit (SDK) and the associated iTunes "App Store" and iPhone Developer Program.
The SDK will allow third party software developers to create applications for the iPhone and then distribute them on the iTunes Apps Stores.
Any members of the iPhone Developer Program can add applications to the store for free; the program costs $99 (USD) to join.
Developers will be able to set the price of the applications or release them for free.
All applications will have to be approved by Apple before being allowed on the store.
Some of the disallowed categories are"porn", excessive bandwidth users and anything malicious or illegal.
VoIP applications would be allowed over Wi-Fi only.
Enterprises can setup private pages on the store to distribute internal applications.
At the event several third party developers that had been given early access to the SDK demonstrated their applications.
Among the applications demonstrated were EA's Spore, AOL's AIM instant messenger and a client for epocrates, a drug reference service.
The company also announced the iPhone 2.0 update that was released as a closed beta for developers and is scheduled for public release in June.
In the new version Apple has been focusing on enterprise features in an attempt to compete with rivals like RIM's BlackBerry and Microsoft’s Windows Mobile.
The update adds support for ActiveSync, which Apple has licensed from rival Microsoft, WPA2 and virtual private network support.
The update will also be available to iPod Touch users for what Steve Jobs described as “a nominal charge”, as Apple have done in the past with the previous iPod Touch and MacBook Wi-Fi updates.
Apple releases Macbook
May 17, 2006
Apple Computer today introduced the new MacBook line, which includes the Macbook and Macbook Pro.
It is the successor to the iBook line and contains Intel Core Duo processors and a host of features, and starting at a price of $1,099.
The Macbook features a 13.3" widescreen display, while the Pro can be purchased with either 15" or 17" displays.
It comes in two colors: Black (2 GHz model only) and White (1.83 and 2 GHz models).
This release leaves only one PowerPC processor computer that has not made the transition to Intel chips, the PowerMac G5.
Apple releases program to limit iPod volume
April 5, 2006
Apple has released an application that limits the volume produced from its iPod portable music players.
The software update, iPod Software 1.1.1, works with the iPod Nano and the Video version.
Apple released the program in response to complaints that it had not taken necessary measures to prevent hearing loss in iPod users.
In California, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple in January over claims of hearing loss from iPod use.
Apple's worldwide vice-president of marketing for the iPod, Greg Joswiak, indicated that this patch is available for people who want "an easy-to-use option to set their own personal volume limit."
It is available for free download.
The software also has the option of being used with parental controls to prevent children from modifying the volume.
iPods sold in France already have the volume limited, as the law forbids a sound louder than 100 decibels (dB).
The American Speech Language Hearing Association published a study where it appears that iPod's (and mp3 players's) power is 120 dB, comparable to a live concert.
A gunshot is 140 dB.
Apple's iTunes replaces Wal-Mart as No. 1 U.S. music seller
April 9, 2008
Five years after its launch, Apple Computer's iTunes downloadable music service in February passed Wal-Mart to become the No. 1 music seller in the United States, according to figures released April 3 by NPD Group, a market research firm.
The firm said more than 4 billion songs had been downloaded from the iTunes store since its launch in 2003 and that as of February, the iTunes store accounts for 70% of all digital music sales.
NPD said according to those figures, Apple's iTunes store passes U.S. electronics retailer Best Buy for the No. 2 U.S. music retailer in 2007.
According to an April 2nd report in Ars Technica, an internal memo at Apple showed the company passed Wal-Mart as the top U.S. music seller Wal-Mart at the beginning of the year.
Their projections showed that as of January 2008, Apple's iTunes held 19 percent of the U.S. music market with Wal-Mart at 15 percent, followed by Best Buy at 13 percent.
Rounding out the top five were Amazon.com and Target at 6 percent each.
Apple swamped by iPhone 4 pre-orders
June 16, 2010
Pre-orders of the recently announced iPhone 4 began Tuesday, overwhelming Apple and AT&T.
Many buyers experienced issues connecting to Apple's website and customer service line.
Some had difficulty finishing their orders online, while others endured long waits at Apple's retail stores due to the online issues.
Some customers reported that Apple had set a recording on their phone lines telling people to call back at a later time, and others even tweeted about their experience.
Since the original iPhone was released in 2007, web servers for both Apple and AT&T have experienced issues at every new device launch.
Today's glitches were apparently in the transaction authorization process, the point when Apple transfers information over to AT&T servers.
Other retailers, including Best Buy and Radio Shack, did not appear to be having the same problems.
Representatives at several Apple Stores in the United States said that buyers should try again tomorrow.
Neither company made any official statement about the technical issues.
The newest iPhone, iPhone 4 was introduced by Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the company's 2010 Worldwide Developer's Conference less than two weeks ago.
It is slated for a U.S. release on June 24, starting at US$199.
Ben Reitzes, with Barclays Capital, estimated that over eight million iPhones will have been sold by the end of the current financial quarter, which ends on June 26.
Shares of Apple Inc. rose US$5.41 yesterday in regular trading, continuing their trend of having risen 23 percent this year.
Apple to give free cases, refunds to iPhone 4 owners
July 17, 2010
Apple Inc. announced Friday that it will give owners of its new iPhone 4 a free case in response to mounting concerns over the device's antenna placement.
The iPhone 4 antenna is actually a metal strip that wraps around the side of the device, which has caused dropped calls when held in a certain way.
The announcement came in a rare press conference held by Apple on Friday morning.
During the event, company CEO Steve Jobs attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone's antenna.
Rather than recall the devices or offer a hardware fix, Jobs said yesterday that Apple will offer a free case to anyone who has purchased an iPhone 4.
The rubber cases, or "bumpers", wrap around the side of an iPhone and have been found to alleviate the reception issues.
Apple's bumpers were priced at US$29 before the press conference, but will be free to anyone with an iPhone 4 until September 30.
Jobs also said that those who had already purchased a bumper will receive a full refund for the accessory.
For consumers still dissatisfied with iPhone 4, Jobs said that the phones can be returned for a refund as well.
Jobs acknowledged that "a very small percentage of users" were experiencing antenna issues, but dismissed the existence of an "Antennagate," saying that similar problems plague all cellular phones and that the iPhone issue "has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible."
He showed videos demonstrating a drop in signal strength when held in a certain way for other smartphones to help make his point.
According to company statistics, about one out of every 200 iPhone 4 customers have called AppleCare to complain about the antenna.
The iPhone 4 return rate is about one-third of the iPhone 3GS return rate.
However, Jobs admitted that the percentage of calls dropped on the iPhone 4 was slightly greater than the percentage of calls dropped on the 3GS.
Jobs attributed the small increase to fewer iPhone 4 users putting cases on their devices.
In response to critics saying that Apple had not addressed the reception problem quickly enough, Jobs said that iPhone 4 had only been out for 22 days and that the company could not have resolved the issue any faster.
The press event came just days after Consumer Reports declined to give Apple's newest phone a "recommended" rating due to the antenna's placement.
The group said that Apple's move to give away free cases is a good first step, but not permanent enough to earn a higher rating.
Earlier, on June 24, Apple told customers to either hold the phone without covering the antenna, or to use a case.
The so-called "death grip", however, has not been as big an issue for other phones as it has for iPhone 4, said Mike Gikas of Consumer Reports.
On July 2, Apple associated the issue with a long-undiscovered software bug relating to the formula for calculating signal strength.
An iOS update released Thursday came with an updated, more accurate method of calculating the number of cellular signal bars to display, but did not actually prevent the signal loss that comes with covering the antenna.
Apple to lower UK iTunes prices
January 9, 2008
The European Commission has forced Apple Inc. to lower its prices for media in its United Kingdom iTunes store, Apple's online media shop.
The change in policy will occur within the next six months, Apple announced this morning.
Apple is the producer of the world's most-sold MP3 Player, the iPod and launched the iTunes Music Store, a online music store, on April 28, 2003.
The store was renamed to iTunes Store in 2006, as Apple began selling other media apart from music, such as feature-length movies.
Since its launch the store has sold more than 3 billion songs.
At the moment songs are sold for £0.79 per song and £7.99 per album which after the price cut will on average be reduced to £0.74 and £7.48 to match the EU prices of €0.99 and €9.99, according to Times Online.
The price decrease follows an investigation by the European Commission due to Apple charging customers in the UK up to 10% more than in other EU countries.
According to The Register, Apple will be demanding that the record labels lower their prices in the UK in respect to this forced price cut.
The European Commission welcomed Apple's announcement and in a reaction to the news European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes said "the Commission is very much in favour of solutions which allow consumers to benefit from a truly Single Market for music downloads."
Apple unveils iPhone 4, iOS 4 at Worldwide Developers Conference 2010
June 8, 2010
Yesterday, at this year's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), company CEO Steve Jobs unveiled iPhone 4, along with the new iOS 4 operating system for Apple mobile devices.
The announcement was long-awaited but not a very big surprise.
In April, the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online.
While introducing iPhone 4, at the annual conference, Jobs started by hinting at the incident, saying, "Stop me if you've already seen this."
The new iPhone was praised by Jobs as "the biggest leap we've taken since the original iPhone."
It is only 9.3 millimetres (0.37 inches) thick, making it "the thinnest smartphone on the planet", a 24 percent reduction from Apple's previous model, the iPhone 3GS.
Structure-wise, iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame, which acts as an antenna, supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls.
It also has a new screen, dubbed a "retina display," which displays images at 326 pixels per inch.
During the keynote, Jobs demoed the device's new internal gyroscope as well.
Even though it now uses Apple's faster A4 processor (first used in its iPad tablet), iPhone 4 has a claimed seven hours of 3G talk time, up two hours from the 3GS.
In addition to its design features, Jobs showed off iPhone 4's new video calling abilities.
This feature is called FaceTime, and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi.
The phone has two cameras: one on the front for video chats, and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos.
The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels, is capable of recording high-definition video, and has an LED flash.
The iPhone 4 will use Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 4.
Formerly "iPhone OS," iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in April, and includes multitasking capabilities.
Jobs called the new software "the most advanced mobile operating system in the world." 
iOS will support Apple's new mobile advertising service, iAd, which goes live on July 1.
iPhone 4 will be available on June 24 in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.
It comes in two colors—black and white—and two storage capacities.
The 16GB version is priced at US$199 and the 32GB version at US$299.
The iPhone 3GS's price will be reduced to US$99, and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued. 
iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices (including the 3GS) on June 21.
In the U.S., iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&T's cellular network, despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers, such as Verizon.
Competition-wise, the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right now.
Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google's Android operating system, as well as Palm's webOS.
Earlier this year, Android phones managed to outsell iPhones. 
iPhone users, however, account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications, commonly called "apps," have been purchased from Apple's App Store.
The App Store currently has around 225,000 different apps for sale.
Apple unveils iPod nano
September 7, 2005
Apple today unveiled its latest addition to the iPod line, the iPod nano.
The announcement came today at a special music event hosted by Apple, held in the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco.
The iPod Nano comes in two colors, white and black, as well as two sizes, a 2GB and a 4GB, capable of holding 500 and 1,000 songs and will cost $199 and $249 USD respectively.
The iPod nano is the second model of the iPod family to utilize flash memory, after the Shuffle was introduced in January.
The iPod nano replaces the similar iPod Mini in the iPod family.
The iPod nano's maximum capacity is 2GB smaller than that of the last version of the iPod Mini, which held 6GB for the same price of $249.
Apple also announced an iTunes-compatible cell phone, the Motorola ROKR E1, which will be available exclusively from Cingular Wireless in the United States, Virgin will be in the UK.
The ROKR has a color display for viewing album art and features built-in stereo speakers, as well as stereo headphones that also serve as a mobile headset with microphone.
Users can randomly autofill or manually fill the mobile phone with playlists of music, audiobooks and Podcasts from their iTunes library via a USB 1.1 connection.
The Motorola ROKR pauses music automatically when users take a call and offers the ability to listen to music while messaging or taking a photo.
It will cost $250 with a two-year cell service contract.
A new version of iTunes was also announced at the event, bringing it to version 5.
Along with a new look, it also features a customizable randomization, improved search for the Library and Music Store, and greater parental controls on songs with explicit lyrics in the iTunes Music Store as well as controlling content of Podcasts.
Apple unveils new Intel-based Mac
January 11, 2006
Apple Computer announced on Tuesday the first generation of their products to use Intel processors.
The iMac and the new MacBook Pro - a notebook computer replacing the PowerBook - are said to be up to four times faster than their predecessors (up to two times faster in the iMac, four times for the MacBook.)
These new lines of computers have been set up to support the newest collection of Mac software entitled iLife, which has added internet publication software to its high-end graphics, video, and sound tools.
Apple unveils new MacBook Air laptops, iLife '11 software suite
October 23, 2010
In a Wednesday media event, Apple Inc. released a new lineup of MacBook Air laptops and the 2011 version of the company's iLife software suite.
The "Back to the Mac" event also included a preview of Apple's forthcoming Mac OS X Lion operating system, to be released in mid-2011.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the new products at the Cupertino, California event, saying the company has "been inspired by the work [it has] done on the iPad, and [it wants] to bring it back to the Mac."
Apple has plans to import more features of its iOS mobile operating system to the Mac OS X operating system.
Jobs announced today that the "Lion" release to OS X, which is scheduled for release next summer, will include more support for multitouch and a desktop version of the company's App Store.
He said that the App Store will be available for Apple's current OS "Snow Leopard" within 90 days, and that applications can be submitted starting next month.
Jobs also announced that a beta version of FaceTime, Apple's IOS video calling application, would be available for OS X users immediately.
Several new applications will be added in OS X Lion, dubbed "Mission Control" and "Launchpad."
In his keynote address Wednesday, Jobs announced the release of Apple's iLife '11 software suite, which includes the iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand programs. 
iPhoto has new slide show templates, while iMovie has added audio editing capabilities.
GarageBand now includes several new piano- and guitar-playing lessons. 
iLife '11 was released on Wednesday as a US$49 upgrade, and is also available free with new Mac purchases.
In another move to bring iOS functionality to Macintosh computers, Jobs announced an updated MacBook Air series of laptops, on sale now.
The new MacBook Air uses flash memory rather than a traditional hard drive, and has no CD/DVD drive, an approach seen on the iPad tablet computer.
In addition, the laptop's battery life has been extended, even though it is only 0.68 in (1.73 cm) thick and weighs less than 3 lbs (1.36 kg).
"We think it’s the future of notebooks," said Jobs.
There are now two models of the MacBook Air: an 11.6-inch (29.46-cm) version and a 13.3-inch (33.78-cm) model.
Analyst Shawn Wu says the company "priced it really aggressively," referring to the computer's base price of US$999.
Jobs said that his company sold 13.7 million Macs last year, totaling US$22 billion.
In the last financial quarter, Mac sales increased 22 percent, comprising 24 percent of total revenue for Apple.
However, the original MacBook Air did not fare so well.
Sales and hype over the first Air decreased soon after its introduction, and the line was overshadowed by the release of Apple's 13-inch (33.02-cm) MacBook Pro.
The MacBook Air had not been significantly updated since 2008.
Beatles' Apple Corps sues Apple Computer
March 28, 2006
The Beatles' Apple Corps has filed a lawsuit against computer and electronics maker Apple Computer in a London court this week, the third such lawsuit in a long running trademark dispute between the two companies.
Apple Corps claims that Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store violates an agreement reached between the two companies in 1991, which barred Apple Computer from using the "Apple" brand in certain uses in the music business.
The trial is set to begin on Wednesday in the Royal Courts of Justice, located in central London.
Presiding Judge Martin Mann has stated that he owns an iPod portable music player, which is made by Apple Computer and marketed alongside the iTunes Music Store.
Apple Corps has twice before sued Apple Computer over its use of the "Apple" name.
The first lawsuit was settled out of court in 1981, with the young computer maker paying $80,000 and agreeing to stay out of the music business.
In the late 1980's Apple Computer added audio recording abilities to its Macintosh computers, prompting Apple Corps to file suit again in 1989.
That lawsuit was settled in 1991, also out of court, with Apple paying $26.5 million.
The settlement included a more specific agreement over the boundaries between the two brands: Apple Computer was allowed to use its name to market "goods or services...used to reproduce, run, play or otherwise deliver such [music] content," but barred from distributing music on a physical medium such as CD or cassette.
Apple Corps' latest suit, filed in September 2003, claims that the computer company violated the 1991 agreement with its iTunes Music Store, which sells digital music that can be downloaded to personal computers.
A statement from Apple Computer stated that "Apple and Apple Corps now have differing interpretations of this agreement and will need to ask a court to resolve this dispute."
Some observers have suggested that the wording of the 1991 agreement, which did not explicitly bar digital music distribution, could be to Apple Computer's advantage.
A similar suit was filed simultaneously in California, Apple Computer's home state, but on September 21, 2004 the parties agreed to have the case heard by the UK court.

Cisco sues Apple for iPhone trademark
January 12, 2007
The iPhone only made its appearance as a prototype and there have been controversies aroused.
The dispute has come up between the manufacturer of the iPhone (which was resented on Wednesday for the first time) - Apple Inc. - and a leader in network and communication systems, based in San Jose - Cisco.
The company claims to possess the trademark for iPhone, and moreover, that it sells devices under the same brand through one of its divisions.
This became the reason for Cisco to file a lawsuit against Apple Inc. so that the latter would stop selling the device.
Cisco states that it has received the trademark in 2000, when the company overtook Infogear Technology Corp., which took place in 1996.
The Vice President and general counsel of the company, Mark Chandler, explained that there was no doubt about the excitement of the new device from Apple, but they should not use a trademark, which belongs to Cisco.
The iPhone developed by Cisco is a device which allows users to make phone calls over the voice over Internet protocol (VoIP).
Reactions to Apple's OS X Tiger
May 7, 2005
In chatrooms and on bulletin boards, Macintosh users and the Macintosh-curious are buzzing about Tiger, the newest version of Apple Computer's Mac OS X, version 10.4.
The open-source kernel, or base of the system, "Darwin", plus all the features of Apple's proprietary Quartz user interface features, software, and system utilities have passed through their next phase of upgrading and scrutiny, and have been shipping for more than a week now.
Apple reports that Tiger, the code name for this release, includes over 200 new features and new versions of application software such as e-mail client Mail, web browser Safari, and multi-person audio/video/text messaging client iChat.
Entirely new features have also been rolled out in this release:
* Spotlight integrates search in the core of the OS, and utilizes meta-data in its algorithm.
* Dashboard provides a sandbox for widgets, handy mini-applicatios like a calculator, sticky notes, and a dictionary, made available at the stroke of a key.
* Automator, a graphical scripting interface that enables non-programmers to automate repetitive tasks.
One user of the new operating system made this comment:
Industry analysts have pointed to both the advances and the failures of the new version already.
Many of the bigger technology advances have gained high praise, but, they point out, Microsoft Longhorn is also expected to have many of these advantages when it is released, expected in late 2006.
And inter-operability, long a strength of Macintosh to work with other operating systems and networks, has had a few bugs—such as reports of issues with Server Message Block (SMB) and Active Directory.
Another issue for some is the fact that Cisco System's VPN does not work with Tiger.
Cisco has promised a compatible release before the end of the month.
The biggest technology breakthrough is Spotlight.
Using meta-data, searches are fast and easy and very thorough, and the results of the search can be used over and over again and will automatically update and change as you use your system.
Search queries on a user's data can be saved as "Smart folders" without ever moving files on the hard drive, so you can collect all your photos, receipts, and webpages about your summer vacation, for example, while still keeping things ordered on your hard drive.
Still, even Macintosh support sites such as Mac News suggest waiting for the first "point" release (10.4.1) before jumping in, which is expected in late May.
Apple Computer has been on a semi-regular release pattern since moving to Mac OS X, with four versions released in 5 years.
This constant development program has occasionally been accused of being aimed at forcing users to constantly pay out for expensive new software, but the returns of regular releases have been quick bug fixes and leading edge technology.
Australian government announces $52.5 million financial assistance package for Ford
May 5, 2006
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and federal industry minister Ian MacDonald today announced that the federal government would be providing Ford Australia with a AU$52.5 million (US$40.4 million) "financial assistance package".
Additional assistance will also be provided by the Victorian state government.
According to Mr Howard, the injection will secure Ford's manufacturing operations in Australia "for the long term".
From the package, AU$40 million will be used for the design and manufacture of Ford's next model Falcon and Territory vehicles, which will be built in Australia.
Despite being given a major facelift in 2002 and another in 2005, the Falcon's bodyshell dates back to 1998.
The current Falcon will need to serve the company until at least 2007 when the new model is anticipated.
In the meantime, it will face stiff competition from the completely new Holden Commodore (the Falcon's major competitor) which will be released in the second half of this year.
The additional AU$12.5 million will be spent on the development of a light commercial vehicle platform, which will be built overseas and marketed to around 80 countries.
Mr Howard said that the light commercial project would involve construction of a research and development centre, which will become the base for R&D projects in the region.
Mr MacFarlane said that the research facility was exciting for Australia and that it would put the Australian automotive in the spotlight.
“The funding has helped Ford Australia secure the largest automotive R&D project ever undertaken in Australia which is equally exciting news for local Ford employees and Australian component producers” he said.
“The project will see Ford Australia become a centre for automotive design and engineering excellence in the Asia Pacific region which will bring spin-off benefits for the broader industry,”
“This opportunity will put both Ford Australia, and the Australian automotive and components sectors on the world map as far as our automotive design and engineering capabilities are concerned.”
Mr MacFarlane said.
Mr Howard claims that the projects will create 273 jobs and secure the future of the "iconic" Ford Falcon, which has been built in Australia since 1960.
The financial package is conditional upon Ford Australia giving the Australian automotive component industry an opportunity to supply components for the vehicles produced by the two projects.
Automaker GM to cut 10,000 jobs at Opel
November 5, 2009
The US car manufacturer General Motors said that it would axe 10,000 jobs at its European division, Opel.
According to the company's vice president John Smith, the firm wanted to reduce costs at Opel by 30%.
Smith announced the company's move on Wednesday.
He didn't say where the cuts were going to take place, but wanted to present details of the plan to European governments "very soon".
A day before the announcement, GM said it was cancelling a deal to sell Opel to Magna, a Canadian automobile parts company.
Politicians in Germany expressed disappointment at GM's cancellation of the Magna deal, which the country's government had favoured.
"[GM's] behaviour towards Germany is completely unacceptable," said German economy minister Rainer Bruederle.
The premier of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia remarked that "General Motors' behaviour shows the ugly face of turbo-capitalism.
That is completely unacceptable."
The UK government, however, welcomed the firm's decision.
"It is the best decision for Britain and our plants," said the general secretary of the British union Unite, Tony Woodley.
"I am absolutely delighted that General Motors have finally done the right thing for them and for us," he told the BBC.
About 54,000 people are employed by Opel, about 25,000 of them in Germany.
Automobile manufacturer Ford posts unexpected profits
November 3, 2009
The US automobile manufacturer Ford has said that it posted a net profit of US$997 million in the third quarter of this year, and predicted that it would be "solidly profitable" by 2011.
The reports surprised most analysts, who had forecast that the auto company would lose money.
Ford's profits equate to 26 cents per share, a large difference to the 12 cent per share lost that had been anticipated by most economic analysts.
"Our third-quarter results clearly show Ford is making tremendous progress despite the prolonged economic slump," said the firm's chief executive officer, Alan Mulally.
"While we still face a challenging road ahead, our transformation is working and our underlying business continues to grow stronger."
Mulally predicted that his company would meet or even surpass all of its financial targets, and suggested that the fourth quarter of this year could see it post an operating profit.
Automobile sales in the United States down sharply
February 3, 2009
Sales of automobiles in the United States fell as much as 35% in January, compared to the same month a year ago, as manufacturers reported their January sales.
Ford Motor Company sales dropped 42% last month from the previous year.
General Motors reported a 49% decline.
Chrysler was hardest hit among the domestically owned manufacturers with a plunge of 55%.
The decline in sales has not been limited to just US manufacturers.
Japanese automaker Toyota reported a 32% drop in US sales from a year earlier, Nissan Motors dropped 30%, and Honda sales dropped 28%.
Subaru and South Korean Hyundai Motor Company were two of the few auto firms that reported an increase in sales.
They posted gains of eight and fourteen percent, respectively.
On an annual basis, sales overall have also been plummeting.
Industry-wide US car sales dropped 18% last year to 13.2 million automobiles.
GM announced today that it will offer voluntary buyouts to 22,000 employees in the US, in an effort to reduce its expenditures.
Last month, GM and Chrysler were given loans worth US$17.4 billion from the government after they warned of imminent bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy for U.S. automaker GM becomes almost certain after bondholder offers fail
May 28, 2009
The United States automobile manufacturing firm General Motors announced on Wednesday that most of its bondholders did not exchange GM's US$27 billion debt for a ten percent share in the company's stock.
The automaker, in financial straits, has a June 1 deadline to finish a government restructuring plan that includes plant closures and other debt reduction measures.
U.S. President Barack Obama's administration said it would not give more financial aid to the firm unless 90% of GM's bondholders would agree on compromises that would significantly reduce the firm's costs.
"The principal amount of notes tendered was substantially less than the amount required by GM to satisfy the debt reduction requirement," GM said in a statement.
"They said no. 
That's it.
They tried.
That's why they're going to have to file for bankruptcy," said a university professor from the University of Michigan who specializes in bankruptcy.
Barack Obama presents rescue plan after GM declaration of bankruptcy
June 1, 2009
In a televised speech from the White House at 16:00 UTC today, President of the United States Barack Obama presented a reorganization plan following the 12:00 UTC announcement by General Motors that it had filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, the largest bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturing company.
Describing the problem with the company as one that had been "decades in the making," Obama explained the rationale behind his proposed reorganization plan for General Motors.
He stated that his intent was not to "perpetuat[e] the bad business decisions of the past," and that loaning General Motors money, when debt was its problem, would have been doing exactly that.
His plan, he stated, was for the United States government, in conjunction with the governments of Canada and Ontario (which he thanked for their roles alongside the government of Germany which he thanked for its role in selling a corporate stake in GM Europe), to become shareholders in General Motors.
The United States government would hold a 60% stake.
The government will give GM a capital infusion of US$30 billion in addition to the funds it has already received.
Of the government ownership he stated that he refused "to let General Motors and Chrysler become wards of the state", and described the bankruptcy of Chrysler, and the bankruptcy of General Motors that he envisioned as being "quick, surgical, bankruptcies".
He pointed to the bankruptcy of Chrysler as an example of what he envision for General Motors, but stated that General Motors was a "more complex company" than Chrysler.
Responding to challenges voiced by political opponents, before the speech, that the federal government would actively participate in the affairs of the restructured company, he stated that he had "no interest" in running GM, and that the federal government would "refrain from exercising its rights" as a corporate shareholder for the most part.
In particular, he stated that the federal government would not exercise its rights as a shareholder to dictate "what new type of car to make."
He stated that he expected the restructured GM to make "high quality, safe, and fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow," and several times described what he anticipated as "better" and "fuel-efficient" cars, after a streamlining of GM's brands.
He said to the general public that "I will not pretend that the hard times are over."
He described the financial hardship that some — shareholders, communities based around GM plants, GM dealers, and others — would undergo as a "sacrifice for the next generation" on their parts, so that their children could live in "an America that still makes things," concluding that one day the United States might return to a time when the maxim (a widely-repeated mis-quotation of what Charles Erwin Wilson once testified before the U.S. Senate when nominated for the position of Secretary of Defense) would once more be true that "what is good for General Motors is good for the United States of America."
CEO of GM outlines plan for "New GM" after auto company declared bankruptcy
June 4, 2009
In a New York press conference at 16:15 UTC, June 1st, Fritz Henderson, the Chief Executive Officer of General Motors, which filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors earlier today, outlined a plan for what he called a "New GM".
Speaking to the press under safe harbor provisions of U.S. law, Henderson described the events of today as a "defining moment" in the history of General Motors.
Speaking to the public he said that "The GM that let you down is history," and described a "New GM" that he expected to result from the bankruptcy process.
Henderson stated that he envisioned the bankruptcy process would take between 60 and 90 days.
He stressed several times his view that the process would be one that is executed quickly, saying that not just a sense of urgency but "pure unadulterated speed" was his expectation of the process.
He emphasized that "GM remains open for business" during the bankruptcy period, continuing to sell and to support its products, and that day one motions had been filed in the bankruptcy court in order to allow this.
Regarding the bankruptcy process he said, "We will do it right.
And we will do it once."
He stated that the plan for General Motors had the support of the United Auto Workers union, the Canadian Auto Workers union, the GM VEBA, and a majority of the unsecured bondholders of GM.
He also mentioned that GM had already received €1.5 million in bridge financing from the German government.
In response to questions about the possibility of the United States federal government, a majority shareholder in the restructured company, dictating future product development and strategy, such as the sale of more fuel-efficient and green vehicles; he first observed that the federal government had already stated to him that it had "no real interest in running our business" and that he expected that still to be his job.
Of the specific hypothetical scenario where the management of GM wants to make one type of car, because it thinks that it is the right thing for the business, and the U.S. government wants to make another type of car, he stated that "I don't think it's going to happen."
Expanding on that point he stated that he expected the "New GM" to focus upon "highly fuel-efficient and green technology", and that operating both in accordance with U.S. environmental laws and in response to customer demand would naturally result in the New GM producing the types of vehicles that the U.S. government would encourage.
The "New GM" he also expected to focus on "four core brands", and will size its dealership to match that.
He stated that GM would offer a "deferred termination" package to dealers, to allow them to cease dealing in GM vehicles in a managed and gradual way.
He stated that the bankruptcy filings did not cover General Motors' businesses in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific.
Of GM's profitable ventures in China, specifically, he stated that they were "a critical part of the New GM".
In response to questions of whether the New GM would import cars from China to the U.S., he stated the formative company's core principle that "We build where we sell" applied in both directions, with GM building in China to sell in China and building in the U.S. to sell in the U.S., stating that this shortened supply chains.
He declined to predict when the New GM would return to profitability, stating that the goal was rather to lower the break-even EBIT point for the company.
He also declined to speculate upon when the U.S. government would sell its stake in the company, saying that that was a question "better addressed to the U.S. Treasury", and merely saying that he expected it to be "years, not months" when the U.S. Treasury felt it would give "the right return for taxpayers."
Chrysler files for bankruptcy, Fiat Group SpA to run company
May 1, 2009
The American auto company Chrysler filed for bankruptcy Thursday, however a deal with European auto maker Fiat went through.
The emerging Chrysler will be owned 55 percent by the United Auto Workers, eight percent by the United States Government, two percent by the Canadian Government and Fiat would begin with a 20 percent share.
Chrysler Chief Executive Robert Nardelli will step down when the bankruptcy proceedings are finalized.
Initially, the Italian company, Fiat, will appoint three members on the emerging Chrysler's new board, and the United States government will appoint six.
Fiat can assume the majority of the ownership upon repayment of American loans.
Chrysler administrators expect that the bankruptcy should take a couple of months.
"We expect this to be a very short, 30-to-60-day bankruptcy process, during which the company will function normally," a top administration official said, "People will be able to buy cars, they will have their warranties honored, and everything should go on normally."
The bankruptcy filing indicated that Chrysler was in debt to 20 creditors to a tune of more than $10 million each.
Meanwhile, the deal with Fiat did go through, and Chrysler should have cars designed by Fiat out on the market by 2011.
"It's a partnership that will give Chrysler a chance not only to survive, but to thrive in a global auto industry," said American president Obama, "Fiat has demonstrated that it can build the clean, fuel-efficient cars that are the future of the industry."
However, automotive analyst Erich Merkle has hesitations.
"History would show that alliances really don't work that well," Merkle said, "even though, no matter how good they may look on paper."
The restructuring has been managed by Steve Rattner, a former investment banker, and the U.S. Government auto task force.
Obama has set three ultimatums before Fiat.
Fiat should produce a 40 mile per gallon vehicle while managing the new Chrysler, transfer fuel efficient Fiat technology to Chrysler factories in the United States, and produce cars in Chrysler factories and distribute them in Europe.
DaimlerChrysler to sell Chrysler Group for $7.4 Billion
April 14, 2007
The DaimlerChrysler Corporation has announced that the corporation is divesting itself of the Chrysler Group by selling it to New York City-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for US$7.4 billion.
The companies' names are announced to be changed to Daimler AG and Chrysler Holding LLC.
DaimlerChrysler has sold 80.1% of its stake in Chrysler, retaining the other 19.9%, for joint ventures and other agreements and partnerships.
Cerberus has agreed to take on billions of dollars in pension and retiree health care costs at Chrysler.
Cerberus also led a consortium that acquired the majority stake in April of last year in GMAC, the financing arm of GM, and is said to planning to invest in auto parts giant Delphi.
Buzz Hargrove, the president of Canadian Auto Workers said he had been assured that the collective bargaining agreement with Chrysler would remain and that jobs would not be eliminated.
The name change of the German company DaimlerChrysler to Daimler AG is pending shareholder approval at the next meeting, scheduled for fall 2007.
Fiat plans to buy majority stake in Chrysler
May 29, 2011
Fiat announced on Friday that it intends to purchase the six percent of automaker Chrysler that the US government currently owns, which would give the Italian company a 52 percent majority stake in Chrysler.
According to Fiat's announcement, the company has told the US Treasury that it intends to use its option to buy the share in Chrysler held by the US government, a deal that will be finalized by June 10.
If a price is not agreed on by that time, Fiat will pay the average of the estimates of two investment banks.
In 2009, Fiat bought a twenty percent stake in Chrysler, which had just exited bankruptcy, and has since increased its holding to 46 percent, expected to increase to 57% by the end of this year.
According to analyst Maryann Keller, the deal is a good one for both companies, as "[n]either one has the ability to compete alone in the kind of global environment that they face."
Analyst Rebecca Lindland said that the move will also benefit the companies by getting "them out from underneath any hint of government ownership and any of that negativity that went along with the bailout."
Ford announces deep production cuts in response to growing losses
August 19, 2006
Ford has announced sweeping cuts of 21% (168,000 units) in its US and Canadian production, resulting in the partial closure of ten of its plants during the fourth quarter.
The measure comes on top of existing turnaround plans announced in January, in which 25,000 to 30,000 positions should be cut and 14 plants closed by 2012.
Ford is the world’s third-largest automaker and the U.S.’s second-largest.
However it has in recent years been struggling with poor profitability and shrinking market shares.
In 2005 it lost $1.6 billion and recently the company reported a second quarter loss of $254 million and a 34% year-year decline in sales for the month of July.
George Pipas, director of sales analysis at Ford, points to rising gas prices having negative impact on the sale of the companies SUV lines as well as its sales leader, the F-series pickup truck as being the direct cause of the latest initiative.
So far the following plants are thought to be affected:
Ford's stock fell 17 cents (2.1%) to $8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ford Motor Company cutting 30,000 jobs by 2012
January 23, 2006
The Ford Motor Company, the second-largest car manufacturer in America, will cut 30,000 jobs and 14 plants as part of a restructuring plan to relieve Ford after a US$1.6 billion loss last year in North American sales.
The plan, called "Way Forward", the brainchild of Ford's Chief Executive Officer, William Clay Ford Jr., is to end Ford's North American losses by 2008.
To accomplish this 30,000 jobs which make up 20 to 25 percent of Ford's North American workforce of 122,000 people will be cut and 14 plants will be closed in order to bring Ford's production capacity in line with demand.
By the end of this year, the Atlanta and St. Louis plants will be closed.
Atlanta makes the Ford Taurus sedan, which is being phased out.
The St. Louis plant is one of two plants that manufactures the Ford Explorer, whose sales had a 29% decline in 2005.
It will also close its Wixom, Michigan plant, Batavia Transmission in Ohio the Windsor Casting plant in Ontario which was previously announced by Ford that it was to be closed after contract negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union.
The plant in St. Thomas, Ontario plant will have one shift cut from it.
The plant makes the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis cars.
On this cut of the one shift, Whitey MacDonald, chairperson of Local 1520, Canadian Auto Workers union said "There is a lot of anger here today, there is no doubt about it.
Any time a plant goes to one shift, it puts them in limbo.
This car has made the company millions of dollars over the years they have invested in other products and locations - we are entitled to some new investment given our track record."
Positive news for the plant is that Ford is still committed to invest $200 million into the plant to upgrade the appearance of the two cars manufactured there.
On the contrary, according to Automotive analyst Dennis DesRosier believes that the factory is still "likely" to close.
DesRoiser said, "The St. Thomas plant is old, the product is old, it make sense it is on that list.
This may be just a short-term reprieve, it may be look at permanent closure in two to three years."
Two more plants will close in 2008, another two in 2012.
Two more plants to be closed are to be announced later this year.
Also, Ford will fire 12% of its 53 executive officers.
Due to the company's current contract with the United Auto Workers union, workers at the idled plants will still be receiving their pay and benefits until Ford negotiates a new contract with the union.
However, the workers may not earn what they earn today because they will not be eligible for overtime.
The UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Gerald Bantom called say the plan is "extremely disappointing."
The UAW issued statement saying "The impacted hourly and salaried workers find themselves facing uncertain futures because of senior management's failure to halt Ford's sliding market share.
The announcement has further left a cloud hanging over the entire work force because of pending future announcements of additional facilities to be closed at some point in the future."
Ford Motors posts US$2.7 billion annual profit
January 28, 2010
Ford Motors Co., the automobile manufacturing firm, has posted an annual profit for the last year of US$2.7 billion, the first gain for four years.
The statistics are an improvement from 2008, when the car company posted a loss of close to $15 billion.
For the final quarter of 2009, Ford says it made profits of $868 million, and expects to continue to be profitable this year.
The company had cut its costs to $118.3 billion last year, $19.8 billion than the year previous.
Ford had a $34.3 billion debt at the end of 2009.
In the fourth quarter, Ford brand sales were up thirteen percent compared to the same time in 2008 in the US, and obtained 15.3% of the automobile market in the country.
The firm's president and chief executive, Alan Mulally, commented on the profits.
"While we still face significant challenges ahead, 2009 was a pivotal year for Ford and the strongest proof yet that our One Ford plan is working and that we are forging a path toward profitable growth," he said, adding that "global economic conditions are reviving but remain fragile."
Ford offers US$78 million for Romanian auto plant
September 8, 2007
Ford Motor Company, the U.S. car maker, will reportedly pay €57 million (US$78 million) for a 72.4 percent stake in the Romanian assembly plant Automobile Craiova, a Romanian official said Friday.
"The offer of Ford Motor Company for a 72.4 percent stake is €4.1556 per share or €57 million overall," said Sebastian Vladescu, head of the State Property Agency (AVAS), after opening Ford's improved offer.
Vladescu added that the contract may be signed on September 12, during the auto show in Frankfurt.
The Romanian government bought back the Craiova-based car maker from Daewoo Motors, in late 2006 for US$51 million.
As the Korean company was bankrupt, the government had to pay another $10 million for debts stemming from past loans.
Ford is the only bidder for the purchase of the factory.
According to Washington Post, many auto-part makers have set up in the new European Union member country, attracted by cheap labor, favourable tax rates and the rising output of Renault's Dacia plant.
The vice president of Dacia, Constantin Stroe, said that the price Ford offers is not important.
"It's important to have the factory working as soon as possible", he added.
"With this production facility, Romania will become an important auto production center in Europe", concluded Stroe, cited by HotNews.
Ford Taurus to be revived
February 9, 2007
Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally has reported that Ford will rename the Ford Five Hundred to the Taurus for the 2008 model year, when a facelifted model is expected to be launched to improve the lackluster sales of the outgoing model.
Mulally says that Ford's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move, and makes their names easily forgettable.
As a result, Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates, the Taurus being one of them, and the Falcon possibly in the future.
The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in 1986, and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan, and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit, leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the "boxy" cars of the 70s and 80s.
The Taurus survived for four generations, selling over 7,500,000 units.
The Taurus was discontinued in October 2006, after a brief run of 2007 models destined for fleet customers.
"How can it go away?"
Alan Mulally remembered asking, "It's the best-selling car in America."
While it is not expected for the name change to turn the Five Hundred into a 400,000 plus units a year blockbuster like the Taurus, it is expected to make sales more solid, and to make the car well known, since the Taurus is a well known nameplate around the country.
Ford's US auto sales spike, surpassing GM
March 3, 2010
Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that its sales in the United States rose 43% in February compared to the same period last year, as the automaker outsold rivals Toyota and General Motors.
Ford said that total sales improved to 142,285 units, compared to 141,951 units sold by GM.
Additionally, Ford said that its share of the total US car market rose to 17%, up from 14% a year ago.
The increase was better than analysts had predicted, and Ford's stock rose to a five-year high in morning trading, before declining later in the day.
Ford's sales were significantly influenced by a 74% increase in fleet sales to businesses.
Rental car agencies alone accounted for around 30,000 units sold.
Sales to retail consumers increased only 28%.
The increases were led by sales of two sedans, the Fusion and Taurus, which rose 166.5 and 93.3% respectively, although sales of other models such as SUVs and pickup trucks also increased.
Both models were significantly redesigned last year, and analysts said that improved quality from such cars were driving the increases.
Other companies also reported February sales today, nearly all reporting sales gains as well, although none as large as those of Ford.
Toyota was the sole exception to the sales gains, as their sales declined 8.7%, as the company was faced with a global recall during the month that led to a temporary stoppage of production for some models.
"The strength of our new products ... are resonating with customers," said Ken Czubay, Ford’s vice president of sales and marketing.
However, he believed that traditional Toyota customers were not buying rival autos, but rather awaiting the results from the recalls.
General Motors automobile sales plunge by 45%
April 1, 2009
General Motors Corporation (GM) announced on Wednesday that it saw a 45% drop in United States vehicle sales for its cars in March.
Executives from several auto firms, however, said that there was some hope for the auto industry to stabilise, as car sales rebounded in the last week of March.
"The market is starting to show small signs of life which need to be nourished like seedlings," said the vice president and chairman of Chrysler LLC Jim Press.
"It's too early to see a trend, but spring shows signs of hope."
Other automobile manufacturers also saw their car sales slip: Chrysler and the Japanese Toyota both reported a 39% loss, whilst Ford Motor Company sales fell 41%.
Annualised sales of vehicles in the car industry in the US are predicted to have dipped below nine million in March, compared to February's 9.12 million, which was the lowest number since 1981.
"Auto makers are pulling every lever in their effort to attract buyers, as evidenced by the new programs from Ford and GM.
The typical incentive programs simply do not resonate in today's economy," Jesse Toprak, an analyst for Edmunds.
Ford shares gained 2.3% to a level of US$2.69 in early trading at US stock markets on Wednesday, while stocks for Toyota's US depository increased 5.9% to $67.
GM shares slipped 1.6% down to $1.92.
GM and Chrysler receive Canadian loans amid US restructuring ultimata
April 3, 2009
General Motors (GM) and Chrysler will receive bridge loans from the government of Canada and the provincial government of Ontario, however no more will be forthcoming from either Canadian or US governments unless the companies can reinvent themselves.
"This is a regrettable but necessary step to protect the Canadian economy.
We are doing this on the assumption that we obviously cannot afford either in the United States or Canada a catastrophic short-term collapse." said Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada.
"We cannot, we must not, and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish.
This industry is, like no other, an emblem of the American spirit; a once and future symbol of America's success," said Barack Obama, President of the United States.
"These companies - and this industry - must ultimately stand on their own, not as wards of the state."
Chrysler will receive CA$1 billion and may in fact be eligible for as much as CA$4 billion.
If Chrysler succeeds in the next 30 days with a restructuring plan it would be eligible for a US$6 billion loan.
A part of Chrysler's restructuring plan must include a partnership with Fiat within 30 days to appease the US administration.
Fiat is a supplier of smaller fuel-efficient vehicles, and the merger will help Chrysler to be viable in the North American market.
A Chrysler court bankruptcy would inevitably lead to it being sold off.
As a part of Chrysler's restructuring plans, Tom LaSorda, the president of Chrysler announced that Canadian operations would fold if it does not receive both the US commitment of $2.3 billion of aid and a new Canadian Auto Workers CAW contract to reduce all-in costs by CA$19 per hour.
As a result of this announcement Chrysler's auto sales volume in Canada dropped 23% compared to March of 2008.
GM has until the end of May to restructure its company to receive up to CA$7.5 billion.
As part of the companies restructuring, General Motor’s chief executive Rick Wagoner was replaced Sunday with Fritz Henderson, the current chief operating officer.
Henderson spoke out on Tuesday that GM has submitted a restructuring plan which would close five plants, and this may be increased to meet the requirements for financial aid.
He is in full compliance with Obama's auto task force to seek bankruptcy if GM cannot negotiate with their unions, bondholders and others.
GM recently brought forward the "GM Total Confidence" program providing consumer purchase protection for customers who lose their job for economic reasons within the first two years from purchase.
As a result of Chrysler's restructuring announcement in Canada, GM's Canadian vehicle sales volume fell only 17.3% compared to 2008, an increase from the previous month.
GM must reduce some of its legacy costs which include its pensions and union health care costs.
A part of GM's ailments arose from investing in supplying truck and SUVs during an economy of high gas prices when consumers were demanding fuel efficient vehicles.
Tony Clement, Canada's Minister of Industry, is hoping that the CAW will support the restructuring process and re-negotiate their agreement.
Whereas a United Auto Workers negotiator has said, “I don't see how the UAW will do anything until they see what the bondholders will give up."
The Obama administration is looking toward bankruptcy proceedings for the automakers, "as a mechanism to help them restructure quickly and emerge stronger.
[It will] quickly clear away old debts that are weighing them down.
What we are asking is difficult.
It will require hard choices by companies.
It will require unions and workers who have already made painful concessions to make even more.
It will require creditors to recognise that they cannot hold out for the prospect of endless government bailouts." said Obama.
The auto parts suppliers and IT software exporters in India have already been affected by the declining auto sales.
GM and Chrysler software contracts provide US$300 to 350 million a year to vendors in India.
As well these two major automakers usually award US$1 billion contracts to auto parts suppliers.
"We are worried and closely watching the developments in the US to gauge the impact.
The decline in auto sales in the US has already hit the order books of Indian suppliers," said a Delhi auto parts supplier.
"Going forward, the industry will undoubtedly be smaller, but if our efforts are successful it will be viable and it will support good jobs for Canadians," said Clements.
Betty Sutton, Ohio's Congresswoman put forward the CARS act which provides a US$3,000 to 5,000 incentive for those who trade in their vehicle for a fuel-efficient car.
"It clearly stimulates the economy, and it gets the consumer into the showroom and gets them buying again.
But importantly — and this is what I particularly like about it — it really helps the environment quite a bit in two respects." said William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford Motor Co.
Ford Motor Company has not come forward with requests for assistance.
Since December GM and Chrysler have received US$17.4 billion government loans.
GM, Chrysler offer buyouts and early retirement to workers
February 3, 2009
General Motors (GM) and Chrysler have both begun to offer layoff packages to their workforces.
The automobile manufacturers have been hard hit in the recent economic downturn and have been forced to seek federal aid from the U.S. government.
Reports say that GM's package includes a $20,000 cash payment and a $25,000 new vehicle voucher.
Chrysler will offer a $25,000 vehicle voucher and $50,000 with healthcare and $75,000 without.
Both will offer the deal to most United Auto Workers (UAW) union members - 62,000 at GM, which is seeking to cut 31,500 jobs by 2012.
The two companies have received $13.4 billion in federal loans to keep them operating, but Congress required them to produce viability plans to demonstrate they were making significant cost cuts and labor concessions in return for the money.
UAW workers in Detroit earn $28 an hour; their replacements will earn about half that.
The UAW's "jobs bank", a system where workers without duties are still paid, has stopped at both companies.
GM is also attempting to engineer a debt-for-equity swap, reducing its liabilities from $27.5 billion in unsecured debt to $9.2 billion.
It is also seeking to sell a truck manufacturer, the Delco Electronics parts group and the Hummer and Saab Automobile vehicle brands.
The entire motor manufacturing sector has suffered under the economic downturn, with the Ford Motor Company announcing a $14.6 billion annual loss, although it has not sought federal aid.
GM and Chrysler both ran out of operating funds in December, leading to the federal bailout.
GM posts first annual loss since 1992
January 27, 2006
General Motors Corporation (GM) has posted its first annual loss since 1992.
GM reported losing US$4.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a total loss of $8.6 billion for the entire year.
GM admitted Thursday night that the loss could swell further as it pays pensions and healthcare costs to thousands of former workers.
GM warned that the amount calculated for last year is preliminary and could rise before it is officially reported to the US securities and exchanges commission in March.
The loss was far greater than analysts predicted.
Ford, the second of the big three American car manufacturers, beat predictions earlier in the week.
In contrast, Toyota is expected to report that it will beat last year's profit of $11 billion.
GM's automotive division lost $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by losses in North America.
This has been attributed to GM's shrinking market share, which has been taken by Japanese manufacturers Toyota and Nissan.
A further $1.3 billion was lost in restructuring charges.
As part of the restructure, GM plans to cut 30,000 jobs and close 12 facilities by 2008.
An aide for Kirk Kerkorian, GMs largest individual investor (at 9.9%), has called on the company to halve its $1.1 billion annual dividend, cut executive pay and sell Saab.
Mary Barra appointed as General Motors chief
December 10, 2013
The United States's largest car manufacturer General Motors today named Mary Barra as its new chief executive.
Barra, 51, will be the first woman to lead a firm in the American auto industry.
She has been with General Motors for 33 years, and is currently the global head of product development.
She said in a statement: "With an amazing portfolio of cars and trucks and the strongest financial performance in our recent history, this is an exciting time at today’s GM.
I’m honored to lead the best team in the business and to keep our momentum at full speed."
She replaces Daniel Akerson, who was appointed by the government as both chief executive and chairman in 2009 during the company's bankruptcy.
Akerson plans to stand down on January 15 following his wife's advanced cancer diagnosis.
In a message to employees, he said: "I will leave with great satisfaction in what we have accomplished, great optimism over what is ahead and great pride that we are restoring General Motors as America’s standard bearer in the global auto industry."
Akerson will also relinquish his chairman role, to be replaced by current director Theodore Solso.
The company also announced head of finance Daniel Ammann as its new president.
The appointment comes just days after the US government sold the last of its shares in the company, losing around $9 billion on its initial bailout in 2008 that saw 61% of the firm coming under public ownership.
General Motors recovered from their bankruptcy a year after the appointment of Akerson, and re-entered the stock market in November 2010.
It remains the largest car manufacturer in the United States, posting sales figures of $152 billion in 2012.
It currently produces fifteen brands of vehicle in 37 countries.
Barra holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University in Flint, Michigan, and was recently listed by Forbes as the 35th most powerful woman in the world.
Penske Auto selected to buy General Motors' Saturn unit
June 5, 2009
General Motors Corporation (GM), an American automaker which has filed for bankruptcy protection, announced on Friday that the Penske Automotive Group (PAG) was selected to purchase Saturn Corporation.
The transaction should be completed in October.
The purchase includes rights to the Saturn brand, its five current models and its dealership network.
Two models would be discontinued, the Sky and Astra.
GM would continue building the Aura sedan, the SUV's, Vue and Outlook for at least two more years.
Saturn has 350 dealers across the United States.
The dealers employ more than 13,000 jobs and sell only the Saturn autos.
Canadian Saturn dealers are not included in the deal.
According to Penske future Saturn vehicles will be fuel economy focused.
An expert indicated that this would move Saturn back to its roots of a entry level car company.
PAG is in talks with several international automakers to replace GM after 2011.
Automotive News reports that Renault Samsung Motors of Korea is the most likely candidate.
Penske wants Jill Lajdziak, Saturn's general manager, and Tom LaSorda, former Chrysler President to head up the company when it is independent of GM.
Serra Automotive in Grand Blanc Township, Genesee County, Michigan, is in talks to take a partial ownership in a new Saturn lead by Penske.
US automaker bailout deal fails to pass Senate
December 12, 2008
A US$14 billion bailout package deal for the "Big Three" United States automakers — Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors — has been rejected in the United States Senate after failing a procedural vote.
The bill was rejected after bipartisan discussions on the bailout broke down when Republican Party leaders insisted that the United Auto Workers (UAW) union agree to increase wage cuts by next year in order to bring their pay into line with those of Japanese automobile companies in the United States.
The UAW refused to meet the demands.
The final vote count in the Senate was 52-35, eight short of the 60 needed to pass.
Only ten Republicans joined forty Democrats and two independents in voting for the bill.
Three Democrats voted with thirty-one Republicans against it.
Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said that he was "terribly disappointed" by the failure of the bill to pass.
"I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow.
It's not going to be a pleasant sight," Reid said.
"Millions of Americans, not only the auto workers but people who sell cars, car dealerships, people who work on cars are going to be directly impacted and affected."
Republican Senator Bob Corker was also unhappy about the rejection.
"We were about three words away from a deal.
We solved everything substantively and about three words keep us from reaching a conclusion," he said.
Some Democrats now want U.S. President Bush to reserve a portion of the $700 billion bailout package earmarked for Wall Street to assist the flagging car industry.
Stock markets worldwide fell dramatically on the news, with Japan's Nikkei average losing 484.68 points, or 5.6 percent, reaching a level of 8253.87 points.
Shares in the auto companies Toyota, Nissan and Honda all dropped by no less than 10 percent apiece.
European stocks, such as those in the United Kingdom and Germany, also lost ground, with the FTSE-100 index of leading shares falling 176.3 points to a level of 4,211 at midday.
U.S. automaker Chrysler wants to eliminate 789 dealerships
May 14, 2009
American automobile manufacturer Chrysler LLC has said that it wants to eliminate 789, or about a quarter, of its 3,200 dealers by early June.
In a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday, the firm stated its network has too many dealers competing between each other and is antiquated.
A June 3 hearing has been scheduled in the US Bankruptcy Court to determine whether the move should be approved.
"This is a difficult day for us and not a day anybody can be prepared for," said Jim Press, the Vice Chairman of Chrysler.
Company executives said the firm is trying to eliminate dealers with poor performances, and retain those who make the strongest sales.
Over 50% of the dealerships that are to be eliminated sell less than a hundred automobiles per year.
"We recognize in the short term we will see some loss of sales.
But based on the long term ... the dealer [network] is key and it's going to be very strong, powerful, with a much better financial viability," said Press.
U.S. automaker GM plans to close 1,100 dealerships
May 15, 2009
American automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM) announced plans Friday to shut down about 1,100 of its dealerships, in an effort to evade bankruptcy and lower its expenditures.
GM's move comes a day after Chrysler, another U.S. car maker, released a list of 789 dealerships that it was closing.
Unlike Chrylser, GM will not publicly announce the dealerships that it intends to shut down.
Instead, dealerships whose franchises won't be renewed after October of next year will receive a private letter telling them of the decision.
At the moment, GM has 6,246 dealers in the U.S. 
It intends to reduce that number to 3,605 by the end of 2010.
GM said the dealerships that were to be closed are "underperforming and very small sales volume U.S. dealers."
“They’re dealerships that are in most cases hurting, losing money, and in danger of going out of business anyway,” said GM's sales, service, and marketing vice president in a telephone conference.
“It’s a move that people could argue should have been taken years ago but this leadership team had no choice but to do it today.”
The dealers that are to be closed represent 18% of the firm's dealership network, but only 7% of GM's 2008 revenue.
US automaker GM reports losses of $6 billion
May 7, 2009
United States automobile company General Motors announced it has lost US$6 billion in the first quarter of 2009, amidst heavy declines in revenues.
Not including special items, the firm said it had lost a net $5.9 billion dollars, or $9.66 per share.
In the first quarter of last year, GM had reported a loss of $381 million, or $0.67 per share.
Most financial analysts had forecast the automaker's losses to be over $6.7 billion, or $11.05 per share.
GM had also reported that it had spent $10.2 billion in an effort to prevent bankruptcy.
The manufacturer has received over $15 billion in bailout money from the federal government.
The company has a deadline set at June 1 to draw up a restructuring plan.
If it doesn't do so by then, it will be obliged to file for bankruptcy protection.
"We're focusing very much on the cost side of the business but once you start losing revenues you get into a vicious circle from which you can't recover," said Ray Young, the chief financial officer for GM.
"We continue to see a 60-80 percent chance of a GM bankruptcy.
While the GM equity today is largely uninvestable, we increasingly believe GM may emerge substantially stronger from a bankruptcy - provided the Chapter 11 process is not overly drawn out - particularly given the scope of targeted dealer cuts," analyst Himanshu Patel said.
US automakers GM and Chrysler seek more government aid
February 18, 2009
The United States auto manufacturer Chrysler, which has been badly affected by the ongoing recession, has asked the US government for an additional US$5 billion in aid on top of the four billion it has already received, saying that it plans to fire three thousand employees.
At the end of last year, the auto maker had just over 54,000 employees, meaning that the layoffs will equal about six percent of its total workforce.
In addition, Chrysler will cut the Chrysler Aspen, PT Cruiser, and Durango from production.
Another automaker, General Motors (GM), announced that it seeks $16.6 billion in loans from the government, in addition to the $13.4 billion that it has already received.
GM plans to lay off 47,000 employees and close five factories.
GM says that it might need as much as $30 billion from the US Treasury Department, an increase over their previous estimate of $18 billion.
The company has warned that it might run out of money by March if more aid was not given.
Rick Wagoner, GM's chief executive, described the firm's plan as "comprehensive, responsive, achievable, and flexible".
"We have a lot of work in front of us, but I am confident it will result in a profitable General Motors," he said, adding that "today's plan is significantly more aggressive because it has to be."
GM says that it could be profitable in two years' time, and might be able to repay all its loans by 2017.
A third US car manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, has said that it can make it through this year without any government aid.
The US Treasury Department will review the car makers' survival plans for several weeks before a decision is made on whether or not to extend the loans.
That decision is due by the end of next month.
U.S. manufacturer General Motors seeks bankruptcy protection
June 1, 2009
United States automobile manufacturing firm General Motors filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors at 12:00 UTC Monday, in a Manhattan, New York federal bankruptcy court.
This was the largest bankruptcy filing for a U.S. manufacturing company, and with declared assets of $82.29 billion and a debt of $172.81 billion, and the fourth largest bankruptcy filing in recent U.S. history — after the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers ($691.06 billion), Washington Mutual ($327.91 billion), and WorldCom ($103.91 billion).
White House considering auto rescue plan
December 13, 2008
After a plan to bail out three large American auto companies failed to pass the Senate this week, the White House has said that it is considering using some of the US$700 billion earmarked to rescue the banking industry to bail out the automakers.
The White House says that the collapse of the automakers would be a terrible setback that could destroy the economy.
"Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms.
However, given the current weakened state of the US economy, we will consider other options if necessary - including use of the TARP [Troubled Assets Relief Program] programme - to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers," said Dana Perino, the White House Press Secretary.
"A precipitous collapse of this industry would have a severe impact on our economy, and it would be irresponsible to further weaken and destabilize our economy at this time."
Earlier this week, the "Big Three" automakers - Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors - had pleaded before Congress to be given $14 billion in funds so as to prevent collapse.
Although the House approved the measures, the Senate voted the proposition down with a vote of 52-35.
Part of the failure of the bill to pass was due to disagreements over labour cuts, which the Republicans insisted reach parity by next year with those of Japanese carmakers.
General Motors stated that the company would stop 30% of its North American production "in response to rapidly deteriorating market conditions".
Asian stock markets slide; Nikkei at lowest level since '82
October 27, 2008
On Monday, stock markets across Asia resumed their downward slide, and Japan's Nikkei stock index fell to lows not seen since October 1982 as the Japanese government's former measures to stop the credit and stock crisis have been seen by stockholders as not sufficient.
Japan's prime minister, Taro Aso, spoke to government officials and asked them to make new tentative plans to save Japan from more damaged inflicted by the worldwide recession.
For the day, the Nikkei closed down 6.4 percent, or 486.18 points, to close at 7,162.90.
The U.S. dollar rose against the yen after six straight days of losses, trading at 92.27 yen to the dollar.
On Friday, the trading value for the yen fell to 90.89, its worst showing for the currency since August 1995.
The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was in a freefall for the most of the day, ending down 12.7 percent, or 1,602.54 points, to 11,015.84.
Before a late session rally, the index was trading below 11,000 points, which has not occurred since 2004.
The Shanghai Composite Index lost 6.3 percent, or 116.27 points, to close the day at 1,723.35.
In the past year, the Shanghai Index, which is the most valued in mainland China, has lost nearly three quarters of its value.
Other Asian markets fell sharply on fears echoed by Japan and China.
Singapore's Straits Times Index, which fell 8.3 percent on Friday, was not open today for a holiday.
Indian shares on the Sensex index in Mumbai fell ten percent, below the crucial 8,000-point level earlier in the day before rallying to a more modest two-percent decline.
Australia's stock losses were also marginally lower, still pushing the All Ordinaries in Sydney to their lowest levels since autumn 2004, at 3,768.
Bank of America reports losses of over US$2.2 billion
October 16, 2009
The Bank of America Corporation, the second-largest bank in the United States, has announced that it lost US$2.24 billion in the third quarter of this year, mainly due to increases in loan losses.
According to the bank, the losses are equal to 26 cents per share, worse than most economic analysts had forecast.
In the same period a year earlier, Bank of America had gained $704 million, or fifteen cents per share.
The bank's CEO, Ken Lewis, said in a statement that "[...] credit costs remain high, and that is our major financial challenge going forward.
However, we are heartened by early positive signs, such as the leveling of delinquencies among our credit card numbers."
Lewis said that losses from loans would probably continue to increase.
In a conference call with analysts, he said that "based on [the] economic scenario, results in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to be challenging as we close the year."
British FTSE index reaches one-year high, other European markets rise
October 12, 2009
The British stock index FTSE 100 closed at its highest levels in over a year on Monday, following news of stronger commodity prices.
The share index increased by 48.3 points, or 0.9% to finish the day at a level of 5,210.17, a figure not seen since last September.
The best performer was the Old Mutual insurance company, reaching a sixteen-month high after gaining 4.6%.
Some economic analysts think that the FTSE index could continue to gain for the remainder of the week.
David Jones, the chief market strategist at IG Index, said that "the next FTSE target traders are eyeing in the short term is the 5,350 high hit in September last year and the way sentiment is going it would not be a surprise to see that hit this week."
Other European markets also posted gains on Monday.
The German DAX index gained 71.35 points to a level of 5,783.23, while the French CAC 40 increased 46.19 points to 3,845.8.
Dow falls 340 points amid unemployment and retail sales rates news
September 4, 2008
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a stock market index used to gauge the performance of American stock exchanges, fell 344.65 at the close of trading Thursday.
The exact reason for the drop is unknown, with different news agencies pointing to different causes.
The New York Times cites a rise in unemployment numbers released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor and a fall in retail sales released by several large corporations.
According to the Associated Press, the number of people claiming weekly unemployment benefits rose 15,000 last week to 444,000, which, according to The New York Times is near a five-year high.
“This morning’s employment numbers continue to indicate that the labor sector remains soft at best and looks to continue to shed jobs throughout the remainder of the year,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Investments, said in a statement to The New York Times.
One major corporation that posted a gain in sales was Wal-Mart, with a 3 percent boost, which resulted in a one penny loss in their stock.
Fellow retailer Target posted a sales loss.
Shares of energy companies ExxonMobil and Chevron fell by 1.5 and 3 percent, respectively.
The other two major American stock indices fell too.
The S&P 500 fell 2.99 percent while the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.20 percent.
The Dow's 344.65-point fall left the index at 11,188.23, a 2.99 percent decrease from the close of trading Wednesday.
According to The New York Times, the drop is the largest since June of this year, but an expected announcement Friday of August unemployment data could cause the index to rise.
The New York Times and the Associated Press both report that the number of jobs in the service sector rose in August according to research done by the Institute for Supply Management.
This is the first rise in the number of jobs in several months.
CNNMoney.com points to the rise in the price of Treasury bonds as a reaction to data released Wednesday that the American economy would continue to be slow in 2009.
Dow Jones Industrial Average closes at lowest level in six years
February 20, 2009
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its lowest level in over six years on Thursday, having lost 1.16%, or 89.68 points, bringing it to a level of 7,465.95.
It had, at one point, set an intraday bear market low of 7,447.55.
It was the lowest ending for the index since October 9, 2002.
The Dow has fallen almost fifteen percent since the start of this year.
Two other US indexes also fell today: the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P) fell by 9.48 points, or 1.20 percent, to 778.94 points.
The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.71% or 25.15 points, closing at 1,442.82.
The S&P had seen its fourth consecutive loss on Thursday, its longest losing streak since last October.
It has lost almost fourteen percent since the start of 2009.
Dan Cook, the senior market analyst at IG Markets, said that the Dow's descent is worrisome since without that level of support, investors may worry that the markets can fall even further.
"It's kind of like if we're walking across a frozen pond.
If that ice starts to crack a bit we're going to be very wary," he said.
Other analysts, however, point out that despite the bad news, the stock market had not descended as quickly as it had been in October and November, and volume was low, suggesting a lack of conviction.
"There's not that panic that there was in November," said Paul Nolte, the director of investments at Hinsdale Associates.
Among some of the losers at the stock market today were Citigroup, which fell 13.8% to US$2.51 a share, and Bank of America, which dropped 14% to $3.93.
In other markets, the British FTSE index increased by 0.3%, and Germany's DAX was up by a fifth of a percent.
Dow Jones recovers hundreds of points, before losing them in minutes
October 10, 2008
Following a large fall at the start of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered by hundreds of points, with it climbing over 250 points again before dropping off to down 100 in just minutes.
After going to down 100, it climbed to 12 up then three down.
Following going three down, it kept going up and down between slightly up and below zero.
Following this, the market went to sixty down, before recovering slightly to -36.
That market then hovered for a few minutes between -30 and -60, before recovering slightly to -11, they going down to -82 again.
The index fell to its lowest level in five years at 8,579.19, falling 679 points in one day.
This, at 7.3%, is the eleventh largest percentage fall in the history of the index.
The growth then continued, with the index being up over 150 points on the start of the day at one point.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, commented on the current financial situation in the US.
"What we've seen here was one big margin call that just kept feeding on itself, so the opposite could happen.
But you need a catalyst," he said.
"I'm more convinced now than ever that this market has made a bottom.
The capitulation came when we breached 8,000," he continued.
"It doesn't mean we can't go back and revisit that level."

On Sunday, the fifteen countries from the Eurogroup – that is, those countries which use the euro as official currency – had agreed on a joint plan to face the crisis, which would consist in supporting financial institutions and by guaranteeing interbank loans.
The Eurogroup meeting was the last of many which took place during the weekend.

Two of the major United States indices saw falls of over two per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 252.01 points (2.90%) to 8,439.24 by 17:30 UTC, while the Nasdaq Composite index experienced a 2.30% drop.
South American markets performed particularly badly today.
By 17:30 UTC, the Argentinean MERVAL index had fallen by almost six per cent to 906.160 points, while the Brazilian Bovespa fell by 6.89% (2,328.45 points) to a value of 31,490.04.
David Buik of BGC Partners commented on today's falls.
"It's carnage," he said.
"Confidence is shot to ribbons.
We need action now.
It is a catastrophe that we have got to recession, but we have got to learn to live with it, and that means saving the markets."
Japan enters recession
November 18, 2008
Japan, which accounts for 7% of world output, has entered a recession after posting two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
The Japanese economy contracted by 0.9% between April and June and a further 0.1% since September.
Kaoru Yosano, the Japanese minister of fiscal policy, said "The downtrend in the economy will continue for the time being as global growth slows down.
We need to bear in mind that economic conditions could worsen further as the US and European financial crisis deepens, worries of economic downturn heighten and stock and foreign exchange markets make big swings."
The Nikkei 225 stock index has fallen 40% since the beginning of the year, and has lost a quarter of its value during this month.
After the news was announced the index dipped, then rose to close up 0.7%.
Japanese companies lose large sums whenever the yen's value surges.
With the yen viewed as relatively stable during financial turmoil, the value against the US dollar has risen greatly.
JPMorgan Chase economist Masamichi Adachi said, "It's only going to get worse.
Japan may be entering its deepest recession in a decade as the global financial crisis cools demand."
Japan has not been in recession since 2001.
Japanese stocks continue to fall after earthquake
March 18, 2011
The prominent Japanese Nikkei 225 stock market index fell another 1.4% Thursday, over financial turmoil after the massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami hit the country a week ago.
For the past five trading days, stocks have been down by a total of fourteen percent; today, they were down as much as five percent, or 454 points, but rebounded to close at 8,962 points.
US stocks also reacted negatively to the cataclysm; the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 1.95% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.04%.
The British FTSE, however, gained 0.77%, but after a large loss yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Japanese yen reached its highest level ever against the US dollar since the end of World War II, peaking at 76.25 to a dollar before finishing the day at 79.14.
Markets down across the world; Dow Jones falls below 9,000
October 9, 2008
Stock markets across the world fell dramatically this week on worries that recent government moves might not prevent a global recession.
The largest drop was with the Dow Jones (DJIA), which fell 678 points or more than 7.3% to below 9,000, closing at 8,579.19.
The index fell over 2,000 points in the past nine days to reach its lowest level since 2003.
The S&P 500 was down more than 7%.
The U.S. markets opened on the positive side, but with bad news coming from several different areas such as uncertainty over whether the 700 billion USD bank bailout bill passed by the United States House of Representatives and the Senate will be effective.
Concerns over the lack of trading within the credit market was a primary cause of the drop.
This was the seventh straight day of markets closing in severely negative numbers.
One of the biggest stocks to drop was General Motors, which lost more than 33% of its value.
In the UK, the FTSE 100 dropped from a day high of 145 points to 52.9 points lower, at a 4 year low.
The biggest drop was Barclays, which dropped 13.1%.
The only major world indexes that gained any value were the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, which closed up 511.51 points or 3.31%, and the Russian RTS, which partly recovered from yesterday's fall with a 10.91% increase.
"Markets are still sceptic with regards to the international coordination to face the problems of the financial system," explained Barclays Capital economists, and they predicted stocks would continue to be volatile.
Investors are awaiting the outcome of several meetings that will be held this weekend.
Finance ministers from the G7 will be gathering in Washington, and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will be holding their autumn meetings.
Markets dragged down by credit crisis
August 10, 2007
Global stock markets fell today, in a mass sell-off stemming from the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded late in the day after falling more than 250 points, ending the day down about 31 points.
The UK's FTSE-100 index fell 232.90 points to 6038.30, and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 406.51 points to 16764.09.
Central banks across the world are injecting funds into their banking systems to add liquidity, fearing that many financial firms with subprime ties will be insolvent.
Yesterday, the U.S. Federal Reserve transferred US$24 billion to temporary reserves, following the European Central Bank, which authorized a record €83.6 billion addition to its banks, its biggest cash infusion ever.
On Friday, the Fed entered into a $38 billion repurchase agreement of mortgage-backed securities, easing stockholder worries.
Also on Friday, the Bank of Japan injected ¥1 trillion into Japan's financial system.
The Federal Reserve met this week, but decided to maintain its target rate of 5.25%, although on Friday the federal funds rate was hovering around 6%, indicating a drop in liquidity.
The volatile week began last Friday with Bear Stearns tumbling as a result from its complete loss of two major hedge funds worth more than $1.5 billion.
The hedge funds had been dangerously exposed to the massive sub-prime mortgage failure, and the company announced it was unable to return any money to investors.
Washington Mutual, and Countrywide Financial, both very large U.S. home loan lenders, saw shares fall.
Countrywide Financial made a statement this week, saying they will be forced to retain a greater proportion of mortgage.
American Home Mortgage Investment Corp, another large lender, recently filed for bankruptcy.
The U.S. housing market has been declining for more than two years after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 17 times.
Now, lenders are in a quagmire from millions of people who are unable to repay loans after taking adjustable rate mortgages, teaser rates, interest-only mortgages, or piggyback rates.
Jim Cramer, of CNBC's Mad Money, remarked that as many as seven million people will lose their homes from bad mortgages.
Last Friday, Cramer went on a tirade on CNBC's Street Signs, saying that the "Fed was asleep" and called for them to lower rates immediately.
Asian and European markets have become increasingly entangled in the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. Deutsche Bank of Germany lost almost $3.5 billion in share value, forcing the government to organize a bail-out.
France's largest bank, BNP Paribas SA, halted withdrawals from three large investment funds which were crippled by sub-prime exposure.
Markets rally as world's central banks infuse cash
September 18, 2008
Stock indexes around the globe reacted favorably after several national banks announced a joint effort to pump more money into the markets.
At 0800 UTC, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB), the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank jointly announced that they would be working together to provide reciprocal credit arrangements to institutions facing a financial crush from the U.S. dollar.
The credit arrangements, also known as "swap lines", will be used to help short-term funding of smaller loan groups.
Totaling US$180 billion, the Federal Reserve arranged to increase existing swap lines with the European Central Bank from US$55 billion to US$110 billion, and with the Swiss National Bank from US$12 billion to US$27 billion.
Additionally, it opened new swap lines with the Bank of Japan for up to US$60 billion, up to US$40 billion with the Bank of England, and up to US$10 billion with the Bank of Canada.
These swap lines will be available until January 30, 2009.
In its press release, the Federal Reserve stated, "These measures, together with other actions taken in the last few days by individual central banks, are designed to improve the liquidity conditions in global financial markets.
The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures."
In the first 90 minutes in the American stock markets, the Dow Jones surged nearly 200 points, the NASDAQ was up nearly nine points, and the S&P 500 was up nearly 15 points.
Mid-day trading in the European markets saw the UK's FTSE 100 was up 25 points, the DAX was up over 54 points, and the CAC 40 was up nearly 15 points.
While Japan's Nikkei index closed at a three-year low of 11,489.30 points, and the Hang Seng bottomed out at 16,283.72 points before closing at 17,849.97 points.
The Russian markets continued to remain closed for a third day under orders of the Russian government.
Russia announced that it would be infusing their own markets with an additional US$19.7 billion, half of which would come from the federal budget.
Russia's exchanges will re-open on Friday morning.
Russian markets to remain closed until Friday
September 18, 2008
The Russian government has continued to hold all stock markets closed until Friday, including the MICEX and RTS exchanges.
Facing its worst financial crisis since 1989, the government is fighting to stem off a crash and restore consumer confidence.
President Dmitry Medvedev went on national television to appease the public.
"There is no more important task for Russian authorities than stability of our financial system under the current circumstances.
This is our top priority," Medvedev said.
"The market should be given all the necessary support."
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin announced that 500 billion rubles (US$ 19.7 billion) would be infused into the stock markets when they opened on Friday, with half of that amount coming from the federal budget.
In addition, the Central Bank responded by offering to loan an additional 60 billion rubles (US $2.63 billion) on top of the 1.13 trillion rubles (US$ 44.6 billion) that it offered yesterday to Sberbank, VTB Group and Gazprombank.
The Central Bank is encouraging the nations top banks to provide the money to smaller lenders.
Central Bank chairman Sergei Ignatiev also announced on Wednesday that mandatory reserve requirements for banks would be slashed, freeing up an additional 300 billion ruble.
"We hope that banks will spend these funds not on long-term crediting or other kinds of crediting of clients," he said, "but on the maintenance of the necessary volume of their liquidity and on making settlements."
In the aftermath of Russia's invasion of neighboring Georgia, the markets saw investors pull out nearly US$ 36 billion in wealth since early August.
Further compounding economic woes are the recent slump in oil and gas prices, which have bolstered Russia's economy for several years.
To help with this, starting on October 1 regulators will lower the export duty on oil, saving Russian oil companies around US$ 5.5 billion.
Russian stock markets suspended amid market turmoil
September 17, 2008
Trading on Russia's major stock markets has been suspended for a second consecutive day due to the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets around the world.
The suspension took place due to an order of the Russian government's Federal Service for the Financial Markets, which demanded the suspension.
"It took too long for the money to get into the system," said Uralsib analyst Chris Weafer commenting on this decision.
"They were afraid of panic selling so they stopped the market."
Before the suspension, the RTS exchange fell by 6.39 percent in just two hours, while the MICEX index started the day with an increase, before falling again.
This day was the worst day in Russia's market since the country's 1998 financial crisis
Several financial markets have continued to lose value.
The primary British index, the FTSE 100, dropped in value by 2.36%, which is 118.40 points, to below the 5000 mark at 4907.20.
The Dow Jones, was down 2.62% at 16:08 UTC, a slight increase from earlier today.
The Dow Jones currently has a value of 10769.00 points.
The NASDAQ index has fallen by -3.16% to 2138.14, while the Dax was 1.75% lower than the start of the day at 16:08 UTC.
The Russian Government has also announced the injection of 44 billion dollars into the Russian economy.
The cash injection will take place through VTB, Sberbank and Gazprom Bank, which are all state run banks.
Shares worldwide surge due to US government plan
Stock markets around the world, particularly those in the United Kingdom, have increased dramatically today.
This is due to the ongoing events in the financial world, including the United States government's announcement that it would buy billions of dollars of bad loans from US banks.
The primary UK index, the FTSE 100, rose in value by 8.04%, which is 392.50 points, to above the 5000 mark at 5272.50.
The Dow Jones, was up 3.10% at 14:58 UTC, an increase of 330.89.
The Dow Jones currently has a value of 11350.58 points.
The NASDAQ index has risen by 2.53% to 2248.63, while the Dax was 5.06% higher than the start of the day as of 14:58 UTC.
The US Treasury described the government's bail-out plan in a press release released earlier today.
It said that "The U.S. Treasury Department today announced the establishment of a temporary guaranty program for the U.S. money market mutual fund industry.
For the next year, the U.S. Treasury will insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund – both retail and institutional – that pays a fee to participate in the program."
Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, explained the government's reasoning behind its plan.
He said that the government was buying bad loans "to restore confidence in our markets and our financial institutions, so they can fuel continued growth and prosperity, we must address the underlying problem."
President George W. Bush, speaking at a press conference alongside Paulson, said "this is a pivotal moment for America's economy."
The government plan is permitted under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, which gives the Treasury the permission "to deal in gold, foreign exchange, and other instruments of credit and securities."
Stock markets worldwide continue to fall
October 7, 2008
Stock markets around the world continued to fall dramatically today.
This is following the ongoing events in the financial world, including the US Government's $700 billion bail out of the financial sector.
As of 18:00 UTC, the primary UK index, the FTSE 100, was one of the few indexes to increase in value.
It went up by 0.16% (16.03 points), but stayed below 5000 mark at 4605.22.
Some shares in this index, however, fared very poorly, with shares in HBOS falling by an incredible 41.54% to end the day on 94 points.
The Dow Jones index continued to fall today, and, as of 18:00 UTC, it had fallen 260.77 points, or 2.62% to 9694.73, continuing its run below 10,000.
Bank of America fared worse, with a fall of 17.38%.
The Nasdaq index also fell dramatically today, down 2.95% (54.97 points) to 1807.99 points.
YRC Worldwide, Inc. was the biggest faller in this index, with its loss of 27.30% that took the company's share price down to 5.13.
Dana Perino, a spokesperson for the White House, commented today on the recent falls in the stock market that are described above.
"One of the things that the President can do is to remind them what this rescue package would do.
One of the most important things that it would do is to make sure that everybody knows that their bank deposit is safe, insured by the FDIC, and the legislation allowed for a temporary increase from $100,000 to $250,000.
This reassures people that their bank accounts are safe, and that's an important message," she stated, trying to reassure citizens.
"But remember, with this rescue package, we asked the American people to do a really big thing and commit a lot of money in order to help prevent the credit freeze from affecting everybody lower on down the food chain.
And to that extent, yes, the President thinks that it's important that they hear from the President of the United States about how he understands that nobody wanted to do this legislation, however, it was the right thing to do.
And now that we've done it, the most important thing is that Treasury move in the most expeditious way possible, to be efficient and to be effective, to make sure that the plan will do what it's supposed to do and un-freeze these credit markets."
Stock markets worldwide fall dramatically
September 17, 2008
Stock markets around the world, particularly those in the United States, have fallen dramatically today.
This is due to the ongoing events in the financial world, including the bailout of large insurance firm AIG by the US Federal Reserve.
The primary UK index, the FTSE 100, dropped in value by 2.36%, which is 118.40 points, to below the 5000 mark at 4907.20.
The Dow Jones was down 2.62% at 16:08 UTC, a slight increase from earlier today.
The Dow Jones currently has a value of 10769.00 points.
The Nasdaq index has fallen by 3.16% to 2138.14, while the Dax was 1.75% lower than the start of the day as of 16:08 UTC.
The Japanese index the Nikkei was one of the few to rise in value over the day.
It ended up 1.2%, although this follows a large fall in the value of the index when it hit an all time low yesterday.
Darren Winder, a market analyst from Cazenove, said that "I don't think anyone has got any or much confidence in market direction for more than a few days."
A lot of today's activities in the market were related to the takeover of the American International Group (AIG) on Tuesday in an US$ 85 billion loan, in exchange for a 79.9% stake in the company.
The fact that AIG has thousands of divisions engaged in business across the globe sets them apart from the recent problems with other banks.
AIG was built up over the last several years via the buyouts and mergers of many companies around the world, offering AIG's stockholders a diverse base of income which allowed it to steadily increase profits.
In addition, the markets have also had difficulties during the past week after the refusal of the Federal Reserve to bail out Lehman Brothers, forcing the company to file for bankruptcy on Monday after Bank of America (BoA) and Barclays PLC pulled out of negotiations over the weekend.
Stock markets worldwide rise on hopes of US economic recovery
August 21, 2009
Stock indexes worldwide rose on Friday, after US bank chief Ben Bernanke said that the US economy was starting to recover from the recession.
Addressing a conference in Wyoming, the bank chief said that "the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good."
He added, however, that "the economic recovery is likely to be relatively slow at first, with unemployment declining only gradually from high levels."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 155.91 points, or 1.67%, to end the day at 9505.96.
The Nasdaq reached 2020.90 points after gaining 1.59%.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, meanwhile, struck a ten-month high, reaching a level of 1,026.13 at the closing bell, up 1.9%.
The British FTSE index rose about two percent, closing at 4,851.
The French Cac index gained 3.1% and the German Dax 2.8%.
"Bernanke was a little bit more bullish than most people were expecting.
He's saying that the global economy is starting to emerge from the recession and that the fears of a financial collapse have receded substantially," said Jacob Oubina, the currency strategist of Forex.com.
"I think the market is just taking those headlines as extreme positives for the outlook."
Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, warned that talk of a complete recovery might be premature.
"I am a little bit uneasy when I see that, because we have some green shoots here and there, we are already saying, 'well, after all, we are close to back to normal,' " he said.
Sub-prime lenders send jitters through global markets
March 13, 2007
Just two weeks after China sent global markets into a tumble, growing worries about sub-prime mortgage lenders in the United States are sending jitters through stock exchanges around the globe.
The three major US stock market indices each fell two percent from Monday's closing price, marking the second-biggest loss of 2007.
London's FTSE 100, Paris' CAC 40 and Frankfurt's DAX 30 indices each closed down more than 1 percent.
As the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that late payments on mortgages and home foreclosures in the US homes rose in the fourth quarter to their highest level in years, investors are concerned that not only US banks but also multi-national banks around the globe could have exposure.
More than two dozen sub-prime lenders have closed or sold operations as defaults on those mortgages have risen.
"The delinquencies and defaults have started to soar," said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Housing Studies at Harvard University.
"A lot of these lenders started to make loans and lost track of some of the fundamentals."
New Century Financial Corporation, the second largest sub-prime lender in the US, has recently revealed that its creditors were no longer providing funds and, further, it has become subject of an SEC investigation.
The New York Stock Exchange has said it will delist New Century.
Accredited Home Loan Lending, another major sub-prime mortgage specialist, said it was seeking fresh capital and waivers on its lending covenants.
Sub-prime lenders provide mortgages to people who do not qualify for loans from mainstream lenders, typically due to their credit histories.
The lenders then bundle these mortgages as collateral for loans that they obtain from other financing firms, such as GMAC.
Such firms can then repackage these loans and sell them as mortgage-backed securities.
These securities may end up in the hands of major multi-national banks such as Citibank, HSBC, and Commerzbank.
Each level of lending assumes a level of financial risk, but trouble can arise when the risk tolerances are exceeded.
If too many homeowners default on their mortgages, the sub-prime lender can end up defaulting.
If too many of these lenders default, as it is feared may be happening now, the defaults can cascade upward.
While no one is predicting major bank failures at this point, it is feared that their profits could be hurt.
US stock markets fall to lowest levels since 1997
February 24, 2009
Three major United States stock market indexes closed at their lowest levels in over a decade on Monday, amidst declining investor confidence and worries that the government will nationalize the banks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 3.41%, or 251.4 points, to end the day at 7,114.3, its lowest level since October 1997.
The Standard and Poor's 500 index lost 26 points or 3.5% to a level of 743.33, its lowest level since April 1997.
The Russel 2000 Index of smaller companies dropped by four percent.
The three stock market indexes have been falling for the last six days.
The Nasdaq Composite index lost 53.5 points, or 3.71%, closing at 1,387.7.
However, the index remained above its November 20, 2008 low of 1316.12.
Despite the worries about the banks, bank shares climbed today.
Bank of America shares rose by 3.2%, whilst Citigroup gained 9.7%.
However, stocks for both banks have plunged more than 68% this year-to-date.
"People left and right are throwing in the towel.
The biggest thing I see here is the incredible pessimism — the government is doing a lousy job of alleviating fears," said Keith Springer of Capital Financial Advisory Services.
"Many investors simply can’t contemplate any more stock market risk in their portfolios.
Sentiment in the market is very weak and negative," said the senior market strategist for Invesco AIM, Fritz Meyer.
US stock markets have their best week since November
March 13, 2009
Wall Street had its best finish since November 2008 after a four day rally with the stock market’s indexes seeing their best weekly gain in nearly five months.
The major indicators in the NYSE had a gain of around 10 percent.
This was mainly due to bank shares bouncing and alleviating fears about the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) finished on 7223.98, an increase of 54 points from March 12 2009.
The S&P 500 Index finished at 756.55 a 6 point gain and the NASDAQ composite had a 5.40 point gain as well to end the day at 1431.50.
The rally began earlier this week after the news from Citigroup Inc. about managing profits during first two months of the year.
The news lessened fears about the country's major financial institutions collapsing after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September.
There was more good news from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., who announced that they have had profits in the current year.
Today was a mixed day for the financial sector, Drug makers had some gains and so did General Motors and Berkshire Hathaway , which helped the indexes gain.
The value of the US dollar fell against other world currencies, but gold prices increased.
US stock markets reach 12-year lows
March 5, 2009
US stock markets dropped to twelve-year lows on Thursday, amidst falling confidence in the financial sector and worries over whether the US automobile manufacturer General Motors will be able to keep operating.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 4.08%, or 280.52 points, at the closing bell, reaching a level of 6595.32, a new 12-year low.
The Nasdaq Composite lost 54.15 points, or 4%, to 1299.59, while the Standard & Poor's 500 plunged by 30.27 points, or 4.25%, closing at 682.60.
Every stock in the Dow Jones, other than Wal-Mart, either lost ground or remained even, and all stocks in the S&P 500 index lost ground.
General Motors' shares lost 15.5% after the auto firm announced that its auditors had "substantial doubt" over whether it would be able to keep operating.
Shares of financial companies were lower by nine percent, with Bank of America losing 11.7% and Citigroup falling by 9.7%.
"What's most worrisome is that we haven't hit the crescendo yet," said Bill Groeneveld, the head trader for vFinance Investments.
"Asset-management divisions are getting calls to just liquidate everything, and we haven't seen the big players come back in at all."
"This is one of the worst bear markets in the last 100 years; it started out with the credit crisis and the subprime [loans], but it is like a forest fire that has raced across the clearing and ignited other parts: Autos, auto parts, the insurance companies have been hit very hard.
The credit crisis is causing an unraveling of industry after industry because the banks don't lend," said David Dreman, the chief investment officer of Dreman Value Management.
European markets were also lower today, with the London's FTSE index losing 3.2% and the DAX index of Germany falling by five percent.
US stock markets tumble on 'Black Monday' anniversary
October 20, 2007
Some say history tends to repeat itself.
Today marked a day in history, when 20 years ago, the United States Dow Jones Industrial Average market crashed, on what is known as 'Black Monday'.
The crash sent the market tumbling down 508 points, losing nearly 24%.
On Friday, the Dow Jones nearly broke that record when the market closed at -366.94 points, down almost three percent.
Several factors could be to blame for the loss, one being Turkey's government approving a measure on October 18 to send Turkish troops into Iraq in an attempt to take out militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
This sent oil prices skyrocketing to the highest prices in history, with the highest record being just over US$89.00, which was set on October 18.
Fears that the housing market in the U.S. has come to a standstill has also lead Caterpillar Inc., which manufactures and sells construction equipment to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop, and the American economy to be severely hurt.
On Friday their stocks lost nearly six percent to close at $73.57.
Investors and experts of the markets are disturbed by the losses calling the situation ugly.
"It's pretty ugly.
A company like Caterpillar should be a poster child for global growth and benefits of the weak dollar.
It makes you question: Is global growth really that strong?
Has the earnings kick from the weak dollar played itself out?" said Bell Curve Trading chief strategy expert, Bill Strazzullo.
Others believe that the losses were a way of emotionally responding to the events of 'Black Monday.'
"Some of the earnings reports were a little disappointing but not that bad.
I think we're responding emotionally to the 20th anniversary of the October 1987 stock market crash.
I'd like to laugh except it hurts," said T Rowe Price Head trader, Andy Brooks.
The NASDAQ also took heavy losses to close down 74.15 points or -2.64%, closing at 2,725.16.
The S&P 500 was also hit hard, losing 39.45 points, or -2.56%, closing at 1,500.63.
US stocks log gains for fourth week in a row
April 4, 2009
United States stock indexes posted gains on Friday, marking a four-week long positive streak.
This comes despite a report released by the US Labor Department on the same day, which said that the US economy shed 663,000 jobs in March, with the unemployment rate reaching 8.5%, the highest since 1983.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a modest gain of half a percent or 39 points, ending the day at 8,017.
The index has not closed above 8,000 since February.
The last time the Dow had risen for four weeks in a row was between September and October of 2007, when the stock index reached its all-time high of over 14,000.
The streak is the index's best since 1993.
The broader S&P 500 gained eight points, or one percent, by the closing bell.
The Nasdaq Composite had the largest gains of the three indexes, up 1.2% to 1,622.
Both the S&P and the Dow gained over 3% over the course of the week, while the Nasdaq was up almost 5%.
In other markets, both the German DAX and the Japanese Nikkei 225 indexes remained even, whilst the British FTSE 100 slipped 2.3%.
U.S. stocks plummet amid global sell-off
February 27, 2007
The biggest U.S. stock market index, the Dow Jones, plunged by more than 416 points by the closing bell on Tuesday, the worst single-day decline since the re-opening of the markets following the September 11th terrorist attacks.
The slip followed a 9% sell-off in Chinese markets.
Other stock indices, such as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, dipped by 96 points and 50 points, respectively.
It was the 7th largest single-day decline is U.S. history.
Analysts blamed the slide on a number of factors: (1) U.S. and Chinese stock exchanges had powered upward for too long and were due for a significant correction; (2) inflation and the prices of bonds and equities had become too high; (3) the U.S. is headed for an economic recession.
Alan Greenspan indicated on Monday that the U.S. economy would not sustain its recent growth, where the Dow Industrials set day-to-day records and the White House signaled on Tuesday that it would revise its estimate of fourth-quarter 2006 GDP growth down to an annual rate of about 2.3 percent from an initial forecast of 3.5 percent and was increasingly nervous that the figure could come in even lower.
Around 3 p.m. EST, Reuters reported that the New York Stock Exchange had implemented on-floor tradition restrictions meant to curb the sell off.
The decline also occurred on the day that a plot to assassinate U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney failed in Afghanistan.
US stocks see 9% drop before making recovery
May 7, 2010
US stock markets saw an unusually turbulent day yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) losing almost a thousand points in thirty minutes, although later recovered somewhat to end the day with a smaller loss.
The DJIA had its worst fall since 1987, a drop of 9% or 998.50 points, before going back up a bit to close with a loss of 3.30% or 347.80 points to a level of 10,520.
The Nasdaq fell 82.65 points or 3.44%, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 3.24% or 37.75 points.
According to some reports, the quick loss happened because a trader mistyped an order to sell a large amount of stock, causing the stock price to go down enough to trigger orders to sell elsewhere in the market.
(By the following day this theory had been abandoned.)
Other reports suggested that the biggest markets "slowed" their executions when it became clear that computerized errors were occurring; as a result, the vast majority of buy orders were briefly withdrawn, allowing the free-fall to continue for several minutes.
Stock for the Procter & Gamble company fell almost 37% during the sell-off, about 75 minutes to the closing bell.
An investigation started into whether any erroneous trades happened.
Procter & Gamble spokeswoman Jennifer Chelune spoke about the incident: "We don't know what caused it.
We know that that was an electronic trade [...] and we're looking into it with Nasdaq and the other major electronic exchanges."
The Reuters news agency reports that, at their height, the losses cause equity values to lose $1 trillion.
Some stocks saw extreme, but short, changes; for instance, consulting firm Accenture saw its shares plummet from about $42 to four cents, although it later rebounded to close the day at $41.09.
Meanwhile, oil prices also dropped to lows not reached since February.
Benchmark crude was down $2.86 to $77.11 in New York.
"The potential for giant high-speed computers to generate false trades and create market chaos reared its head again today," said Delaware senator Edward Kaufman.
"The battle of the algorithms — not understood by nor even remotely transparent to the Securities and Exchange Commission — simply must be carefully reviewed and placed within a meaningful regulatory framework soon."
Kaufman, along with senator Mark Warner from Virginia, called on Congress to investigate the cause of the mass sell-offs.
Nasdaq, meanwhile, says that all trades of stocks at prices 60% higher or lower than the preceding price at or around 2.40 PM "or immediately prior" are to be cancelled; it noted that it coordinated its move with the other exchanges.
Chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group Charlie Smith said: "I think the machines just took over.
There's not a lot of human interaction.
We've known that automated trading can run away from you, and I think that's what we saw happen today."
In the past three days, the DJIA has lost 631 points, or 5.7%, mainly over concerns about Greece's ailing, debt-burdened economy.
Peter Boockvar an equity strategist for Miller Tabak, commented: "The market is now realizing that Greece is going to go through a depression over the next couple of years.
Europe is a major trading partner of ours, and this threatens the entire global growth story."
World stocks plunge on fears on US recession
January 21, 2008
Stock prices dropped sharply in Europe and Asia Monday, with fears of economic problems in the United States causing some of the biggest single-day losses in recent years.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 5.5 percent - its biggest fall since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Losses of between three and seven percent were recorded in India, China, Britain, France, Germany and Canada.
While there are many factors linking national economies, analysts blame recent losses on fears of a recession in the United States.
The United States is the main export market for many overseas businesses.
Foreign investors also have bought large stakes in U.S. companies.
When American home loan companies began reporting large numbers of defaulting loans in late 2007, the losses spread to other financial institutions, tightening credit markets and sparking worries about Americans' high levels of debt.
Last week, President Bush proposed a $145 billion stimulus plan to encourage more consumer spending.
But analysts say the measure may not be able to prevent a recession - defined as a broad decline in a nation's economy over a period of at least six months.
U.S. markets are closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a national holiday, but stock futures trading indicates further losses are expected when markets reopen Tuesday.
Worldwide markets fall precipitously
October 6, 2008
Stock markets around the world have fallen dramatically today.
This is following the ongoing events in the financial world, including the US Government's $700 billion bail out of the financial sector.
As of 14:48 UTC, the primary UK index, the FTSE 100, dropped in value by 6.50% (323.65 points) to a point even further below the 5000 mark at 4656.60.

The Dow Jones index was one that fared particularly poorly today, as not one of its companies increased its share price.
The same is true for the CAC 40 index.
The Merval index is another one that fared badly today.
It dropped in value by 10.12%, while the affiliated Merval 25 index dropped by nearly as much, 10.03%.
One of the worst faring indexes of the day was the Brazilian Bovespa index.
It has already fallen by 14.45% today, despite the fact that it is not even half way through the trading day.
