Can you find it?
The artist Jean-Louis Aubert is apparently right to say: "If you have joy in yourself, you could more easily catch happiness." Thus, in all circumstances, the blessed will never be completely cut down; he will always keep some verve. This could be called resilience.

As another of our friends has said, translation is not about replacing one language with others. Translation will, on the contrary, help the language to enter the scientific field so that it can be promoted again and again. We should open our eyes: there is a huge difference between a translated language, which can be adopted, and an orphaned language whose mere diffusion would constrain it, even if that were not the original intention.

When the last drop overflows the vase, the fault does not lie with the drop but with the water that was there before.
He went out of the river.
I need a rental car.
You should eat now.
Thanks for always helping me.
How many books have you read?
Are you serious?
Wood burns.
You can't leave me like this.
Nobody died.
Something's missing.
Thank you for inviting me here.
Are you expecting somebody?
Who vanished?
Will she come?
You always make a mistake.
I drank a cup of coffee.
Are you writing a letter?
I get a haircut every month.
Tom needs me.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
That's too much.
How many times?
Who else uses Tatoeba in your office?
Tom volunteered to help Mary.
I'm tired of your complaints.
Tom moved to a new place.
Tom and I went to the party together.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
I want to visit Boston in the spring.
Make me a sandwich.
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Maybe somebody wants that.
Who vanished?
Don't you have to work tomorrow?
When did you come back from Boston?
Are you OK?
Now that I'm a grownup, I think otherwise.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
I didn't know what else to say.
Be attentive.
I don't want to grow up.
I'll never overlook your mistakes again.
Make it simple.
How many books do you have?
You must learn from mistakes.
Bring her home.
Do you watch TV every day?
How do you take your coffee?
You have lipstick on your teeth.
I saw him no more.
We’re not going to take a nap.
I hope to be back by October 20th.
Wait right here.
I wonder where she is.
Tom never got his money back.
I always walk.
Tell me something about him.
Please don't die.
Tom pretended he hadn't heard what Mary had said about him.
I think that we can help each other.
Oh boy...
Get lost.
Tom stayed.
Somebody stole it from me.
Did Tom say that he'd stay in Australia?
If I were you, I would go home and take a good rest.
Some of what you said sounded stupid.
Tom and I went to the party together.
Do you really believe those stories?
Let him be calm.
Has your god come in peace?
Aren't you hungry?
Watch yourself.
Can somebody give me a hand here?
Tom couldn't save Mary.
Tom lives in Australia with his mother.
God exists.
You must have lost them.
Tom is lying.
Who will take his place?
You're older than Tom.
I've got my pride.
Tom and Mary helped each other.
Release Tom.
Somebody tried to kill you.
Everyone agreed.
I've already told you that I'm not the one who did that.
A big glitch fell on me.
Are you Catholic?
Take your time.
Champagne, please.
Where are those boys from?
The world is a small village.
Anything else?
You should ask somebody else.
I hope no one sees us.
Plants grow.
Sami was beating Farid's ass.
What time will you leave?
I hope no one sees you like this.
I want to know more about your country.
I hate French.
Tom was fired on October 20th.
I hope no one saw you.
Stop touching me.
Tom answered in detail.
Tom is also going to be late today.
The committee comprises ten members.
Do you think Tom likes me?
Goodnight, Mother.
Do you like dogs?
Do you want to stay any longer?
Have you ever milked a cow?
Tom took the last available spot.
He is going to destroy the economy.
Tom loved you.
I speak Ancient Greek.
Tom lied about where he was on that day.
Tom vanished.
Hello honey.
There'll be no classes on October 20th.
Are you lying to me?
You are expecting too much of her.
You are blushing.
You're part of the problem.
Stop moving!
Sami was beating Farid's ass.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
Are you handicapped?
I hear something.
What's your problem?
Any carrion lying around is visited by the hyena.
How lucky to meet you here.
Play Chopin for me.
Move quietly.
I hope Tom is tough.
Stop worrying.
Have you seen him?
Are you shy?
Dan bought a new computer.
Is someone there?
Tom doesn't know how to write with the computer.
My favorite month is October.
I was in the mountains.
Stephen died.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Did you check them?
Please tell me your real name.
I hope nobody followed you.
Is somebody there?
I hope no one followed you.
Tom was accompanied by Mary.
Let's go and tell the others.
Is this wine?
Please repair this.
Nothing I do is appreciated.
Have you seen Tom yet?
It's so sweet.
Follow the trace.
You have a green book.
Tom knows I'm not afraid of anybody.
She is reading it.
Did someone contact you?
I don't think that counts.
He brought her home.
Everybody hates Tom.
Tom and Mary ran into each other at the station.
You must have lost them.
Can I count on you?
Enter!
I want you to go to your room and pack your things.
Let's try something.
No problem!
Stop worrying.
You're our prisoner.
We ridiculed him because of that thing.
Welcome home.
Wait right here.
Are you working tonight?
Stay with me for a moment.
Please let me pay.
Tom refused to provide any details.
I know Tom is a Canadian.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
Tom will be thirty in October.
Jim resembles his father.
I need you here.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
Are you jealous?
Have you become insane?
Tom will tell Mary.
Do you write in French?
Tom never kisses his wife anymore.
Nobody knew.
Give up!
None of Tom's advice was very useful.
Life lies in front of you.
Everyone escaped.
We traveled around the country by car.
I am Chinese.
Did Tom say anything about his accident?
Tom blamed Mary.
Are you sick?
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Tom only slept for a few hours.
Sing along.
Sami was speaking to his mother.
I let Tom kiss me.
Sami found trash in the hallway.
Wait for him.
Tom said he needs to get some air.
Tom is waiting.
Somebody is watching us.
I'd like to show you some translated texts for you to correct.
Stop gossiping.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
It's secret.
Construction started in October.
I brought you something to eat.
Turn around.
I was kind of surprised to see Tom there.
Choose carefully.
Listen to this!
They built it.
You must never forget that.
I can't see her.
They're cool.
Tom thought that Mary might've been brainwashed.
Tom seemed to be ignoring Mary.
Tell me again who will be helping us.
Tom stopped reading.
You need to stay away from them.
Aren't you about the same age as Tom?
Sometimes a nod is enough to show someone that you're listening attentively.
Tom attended the party yesterday.
Hey, Ayako, make your voice louder.
How deep?
You are welcome!
It happened that I was in her room.
You're all mad.
I haven't been in Boston since October.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
Tom isn't good at talking to people.
Everyone was happy.
October is over.
Thank you for listening.
Can you fix this?
Your attention, please! Now, the doors are closing.
Somebody might stop you.
Don't slurp when you eat soup.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Tom is poor.
A toothless mouth can't help but smile.
You stink.
The registration deadline is October 20th.
You swim better than me.
Tom claims that he can speak French.
I will do all I can for you.
Swimming is good for your health.
I'm retired.
Tom didn't mention Mary.
Keep your clothes clean.
How lucky to meet you here.
I was on the road last summer.
Why doesn't anybody answer?
Eat something.
You saw that movie, didn't you?
I guess I'll have to leave now.
Tom threw Mary's sunglasses out the window.
Can I talk to you privately?
Who's ready to order?
I want to call my lawyer.
I'm very disappointed in Tom.
We're starving here.
Sami is crying like a baby.
Tom and I love each other.
The man who I thought was my friend deceived me.
We didn't ask Tom to help.
Your eyes are lying.
Let me out!
What does this look like to you?
Sami read a lot.
I'm retired.
She called him.
Hey, you.
Kick! Kick!
Tom fired three shots at Mary.
Don't force yourself to eat if you don't want to.
Tom was angry at Mary.
Someone stole my money.
Hey, Ayako, make your voice louder.
Tom doesn't look very happy.
The computer is new.
Say it clearly.
Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
Tom never asked me.
Have you lost your reason?
When are we going to do it?
Tom needs to buy a ticket for Mary, too.
You are crazy.
Anybody here?
Can I go home now?
She is a woman, not a girl.
Sami told me you were in the kitchen.
You will be hungry.
I continued working.
Ask them.
Somebody is following us.
I moved here last October.
Will you come with me?
Tom wanted to work.
Tom became friends with Mary when he was living in Boston.
You have no idea.
Tom is much younger than me.
I finally visited Boston last October.
Warn Tom.
Please let me out.
Tom is not a Pokémon.
Someone is calling you.
Quick!
That's the truth.
We forgot all about you.
I love you very much.
I know those people.
You're all right.
I want to travel with you.
Have you already read this?
Tom didn't think I could do that.
Tom and I walked together.
Everything okay?
Carry this.
I'm no friend of yours.
I hate coffee.
She gives instruction in English.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Leave it up to us.
He sent me a word.
Know thyself!
It makes no fucking sense.
Ask anybody.
I won't let you pay.
I need to be alone to think.
Walk more slowly.
Did Tom believe it?
They eat these things.
Someone is watching you.
He is English.
Tom didn't have to be here on October 20th.
You're all crazy.
Is there something troubling you?
Tom ate a huge bowl of spaghetti.
Is Tom still crying?
I think that's not true.
Get your carcass out of here!
Djafar is a shepherd.
They missed the train.
They are dead.
He dances.
This is my opinion, not yours.
They're armed.
Quiet, please.
Tom is anorexic.
Leaves begin to fall in October.
Read!
Tom was furious with Mary.
Go get changed.
He lifted earth and sky!
Somebody has done that already.
Tom can't help.
Every success in your new job.
He hates the Algerian authority.
Come home.
What's the matter?
He came.
Is someone in there?
Can you find it?
You should be a writer.
I saw you in my dreams.
Give it a try.
You won't make mistakes.
Answer them.
Tom seems to be very happy.
I learned that from you!
I still love Tom.
Stand up.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary.
He's smart.
Think again.
In unity there is strength.
Please do as I say.
You're part of the problem.
Are you nuts?
Whose is it?
You drank a cup of coffee.
Can you see?
How long have you studied?
When did you first come to Australia?
Tom is mocking Ken.
Tom lifted the lid carefully.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
You stayed at home.
One question.
Tom smirked.
I remember.
Tom loves watching Mary dance.
I've lost.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
I'm eating bread.
They answered.
My back hurts.
Whether he is tired or not, the job is waiting for him.
Stop arguing.
He just goes and comes.
"The lizard dares to face the hydra." is like "Someone is attacking an ash tree with a sickle," one of our friends tells us.
She is dead.
He built it.
Come immediately.
Did you call?
Give me a call tomorrow.
Snow is falling.
You'll be seeing Tom soon.
Send this letter by air.
Tom would have approved.
Somebody's coming.
Cars are expensive.
Everybody was really happy.
The first instrument of the genius of a people is their language.
Let me be.
Look at my new car.
Call us.
Where did you find it?
Tom was sitting under a tree.
You can use my computer if you want.
Don't touch.
Catch Tom.
Nobody understands.
Please give me a hand with my job.
You must not stay here.
Kabyle people love their language.
I don't have a solution.
Where have you been?
Tom has a new hobby.
You wanted to get your hands on Tom's money.
Everyone noticed.
She swims well.
She likes to read.
Tom looks scared.
I'll tell Tom you said that.
He provided us with everything we needed.
Tom hated Mary.
What are you going to do if it rains?
Our teacher hates his students to ask questions while he is giving a lecture.
Look at my new car.
Happy anniversary!
No one knows.
Tom does everything by himself.
Wood burns easily.
Do you come back from Tibet?
Hurry up.
Stop dreaming.
Haven't you had your dinner?
Don't rush things.
Tom seems happy.
She loves you very much.
Your writing is horrible.
We hope many of you will come.
I met Tom this October.
Are you generous?
Screw you!
Are you home?
I met her only once.
Please telephone him.
Did you hear what they were saying?
The flag of Kabylie is beautiful.
Tom was Mary's high school crush.
Is somebody here?
Just let me in.
Eat shit — millions of flies cannot be wrong.
Stop yelling.
What are Tom and Mary arguing about?
Save her.
I want to kiss Tom.
Tom and Mary are getting nowhere.
Have you seen the new movie?
I found your cap.
He was entranced by her beauty.
I play Chopin.
You look amazing.
He was born rich.
Please pass me the salt and pepper.
I'll give you a call tomorrow night.
You should try to meet with Tom.
I know that Tom is chubby.
Tom needs a dozen eggs.
I've been told that Tom is still in Australia.
I'm going to eat at a Chinese restaurant tonight.
Tom spoke French.
Tom doesn't talk.
Now that I am a teacher, I think otherwise.
Mary loves shopping for clothes.
I don't know who killed him.
Sami was about six.
Stop studying!
Maybe you should've told Tom the truth.
Somebody killed Tom today.
I want you back today.
Get your carcass out of here!
Seize him!
Did somebody mention my name?
You look European.
Somebody came to our house.
I need you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I'm full.
Let me explain.
The boy is nice.
You are an idiot!
Djafar is stealing chickens.
Ask whichever of the boys you see first.
When was the last time that you were this busy?
Someone's calling.
Desiring noise and company, Tom went along to the shooting gallery and knocked down a few ducks.
Fix this.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
He just talks, he don't discern.
I'm looking forward to your Halloween party.
Call me.
I know that it's been a long trip.
I caught the flu.
Please repeat.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay absolutely still.
Take this table away.
You are happy.
Go warm up.
You're new here, aren't you?
It is a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
Somebody might stop me.
Closing your eyes helps you think better.
Look again.
Tom or somebody said that.
Rest.
I suspect Tom is ready.
You traitor!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Talk!
Wash up.
Tom is unstoppable.
Get down!
Where does Tom live?
Let me be.
Have you read this book yet?
Tom almost beat Mary to death.
We're on the balcony.
You're not tired, are you?
Tom won a Nobel Prize in physics.
Tom didn't help Mary.
Is that French?
Open the door.
I read it incorrectly.
Tom didn't want to get married.
Try to guess.
Is he dead?
You're our prisoner.
Exercise is good for you.
You saw Tom do that, didn't you?
Tom did not raise his head.
Neither of my parents can speak French.
No kidding.
Today's October 20th.
My youngest brother was brought up by our grandmother.
I forgot.
You are so smart!
I'll eat this if you do, too.
Stop shouting.
That is worth of it.
Is it the truth?
Tom had to resign from his job.
Somebody just called.
Tom dressed like a girl for Halloween.
Somebody broke into Tom's house last night.
What is your philosophy?
Am I wrong about that?
I've earned this.
Where do you live now?
Sami looked depressed.
Welcome home.
I look forward to corresponding with you.
Truth prevails.
Your philosophy of life is different than mine.
Somebody's following me.
We took baskets and went directly to the market.
Are you sick?
Tom arrived ahead of Mary.
Sami is going back to work.
Don't move.
You're home too?
She seems to be living by the lake.
Tom came alone, without Mary.
Keep writing.
Let's try and find a cure.
You had better have your hair cut.
Yes, please.
I can't swim well.
Do kiss to your heart's content.
Is it true that Jesus is the son of God?
Make a wish.
When did you come to Boston?
From now on, let's only speak French.
Sami felt like he knew Layla.
Now I just came out of a bar in Akfadu.
This is the kind of food that I like.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Is it free?
You befooled me.
All our food is rotten.
Do good to those who hate you.
No matter how fast you drive, you won't get there on time.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
To learn a language, it is imperative to know the conjugation of verbs.
Everybody's dead.
I hate working.
Straighten up.
Do you know how far Boston is from Chicago?
I was going to get bigger when my grandson got ahead of me.
Can you fix this?
Tom wasn't here last week.
Where's your aunt?
I believed everything they told us.
Nobody laughed.
Let them help you.
We heard the door open.
Are you excited?
Are you sad?
There's somebody out there.
Sami and Layla were arguing about a fucking three-dollar coupon.
They want something to write with.
These books are ours.
Are those your parents?
Have another cookie.
Tom is a hunk.
What should we say?
How many pounds have you gained?
French is difficult.
He walks fast.
I think I'm being watched.
They smoke.
People are friendly in Australia.
How strong you are!
Tom loves making things.
You're a problem.
You're a guest here.
I've always been proud of you.
You could have been mistaken.
Hi! How are you?
Tom used to cry a lot.
Tom says he's never grown corn.
Are you busy now?
Where do you buy your clothes?
Toughen up!
Always have your dictionary near at hand.
Get dressed.
I hope you understand.
We left early.
You're our prisoner.
Tom has enough money to buy what Mary wants.
Tom approves.
Tom was shocked.
Come in.
Sami's car was doing very well.
Stop singing.
Love lasts.
Close your eyes.
Is there somebody you want to see?
How do I explain it?
Tom left on October 20th.
Have you lost your reason?
How many?
I want someone to talk to.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Tom and Mary helped each other.
Sami was shopping with one of those bags.
I know it takes courage to do that.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me for a moment.
Go and take a cold shower.
October 20, 2014 was a Monday.
Tom burped.
Examine them.
You look European.
This landscape reminds me of Italy.
It's the third of October.
He's smart.
Snow is white, soot is black.
Nobody cares who you are.
Your writing is horrible.
I'm so happy.
Somebody stole it from me.
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.
Who is the best football player in the world?
Nothing hurts like the truth.
Cheers!
You sure eat a lot.
Religion is the opiate of the masses.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Do you have school today?
Our time has come!
We eat the meat.
Tom drinks twice as much as Mary.
I want to know who called.
Would you like anything else?
Just talk with them.
You could get milk from the cows.
No worries!
You have only to put them together.
You're wet through.
My fate is in your hands.
I'm looking for somebody.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Good morning!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom didn't know Mary.
Tom walked.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
What's your theory on what happened?
I'm undressing.
I received an invitation.
I really dislike chicken.
His father has never been abroad.
How many books did you read?
You speak like your mother.
I laughed at Tom.
Are you Ukrainian?
It's not important.
You'd better start at once.
What's the tallest building in Boston?
I study.
When are you going to eat?
I hear music.
I'll call you this evening.
Somebody set the fire.
I'm so glad I didn't know.
Somebody broke into Tom's house last night.
Tom did not raise his head.
I am busy today.
Do you enjoy Tom's company?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Try to keep Tom from leaving early.
Keep oil away from the fire.
Everything will be different.
Tom humiliated Mary in front of everyone.
Have another.
If you need me, call.
They don't help.
Stop bothering me!
Can you fix this?
Tom prayed.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I think Tom must be thirsty.
He leaned on it so much that it broke.
We got married on October 20th.
I'm sure they're wrong.
I want to eat pork chops.
Tom isn't likely to know where Mary lives.
Do you like science fiction movies?
They spoke French.
It's best to tell the truth.
Close the window.
They eat these things.
Tom knows better.
It is a mistake!
Are you fucking kidding me?
No one knows what the future holds.
Somebody had to do it.
Tom gave the teacher an apple.
Have you lost your reason?
Tom looks strong.
Everybody is glad Tom got caught.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
If you keep playing with fire, expect to get burned.
I wonder where they are.
I understand.
I wish I'd been healthy enough to do that.
Tom doesn't live in Australia.
You are home.
Run faster, otherwise you will miss the train.
I met a man who knows Tom.
Look closer.
I like pop music.
No one is saying that.
Everybody smiled.
That was an evil bunny.
Do you go to school by train?
Why do people lie?
Someday I'll buy a cotton candy machine.
Do you think we'll win?
Check again.
Nobody's been inside.
I wished him a good night.
Tom will sit here.
I think her opinion is important.
Look at my new car.
Quit gambling.
This table is reserved.
Water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sami replies faster on Facebook.
Somebody has broken this dish.
She's not studying music.
I don't know where he is.
I was caught in the rain.
I know.
What papers do you take?
You are dreaming.
Does Tom work in Australia?
Pull.
I can't write that well.
Your father is a good-looking man.
Tom sat down on the bed next to Mary.
Anyway, expressions like "Muslims love Jesus and Moses ... and vice versa" are cryptic sweetened sibylline sentences addressed to Evangelical and or Orthodox ears who think no less or sometimes worse. It was only when I saw a famous TRUMPetist dancing with all the turbaned people in the Gulf that I understood and thought: they surely have things to share, our resources, for example. Religion is just used as a tool for INTROMISSION, more or less admitted, for those who exhibit recessive genes, or according to their predispositions ability to the kamasutra positions.
Where's your grandmother?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Are you Anna?
Please find him.
You just sit there and wait until Tom gets back.
Do you see your table?
Are you Hungarian?
Wait and see; this child is about to get dirty.
My chicken is here.
The loaded desk groaned again.
Send me somebody right away.
Somebody's waiting for you.
Tom accelerated.
Tom came to visit Mary.
Who talked?
There was no money left in my wallet.
The animals were scared by the thunder.
Tom is nice.
Love has blinded you.
Everybody knows that.
Please help me open this door.
Can you open the door for me?
Get your hand off me.
You are expecting too much of her.
I probably shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
Stop pushing.
Delicious.
Are you expecting somebody?
This girl is well educated.
Stop arguing.
Go inside.
Look alive.
That happened on October 20th.
What is your age?
You're a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters.
Don't use this apparatus near water.
I wish it were always like this.
Not so easy to find what could be this thing.
Stand by.
Tom abandoned them.
I wish it were always like this.
Get your carcass out of here!
I want you to read this letter.
You are ill.
Tom is coughing.
You heard her, didn't you?
You are dead.
I know Tom is a student.
We bought a bottle of water.
Slowly!
Somebody should do something.
Leave everything.
I can teach you how to read.
That is a student whom my father teaches.
I'm starving!
You should apologize.
Sami has had the worst day ever.
Sami noticed a sudden change in Layla's tone.
Are you eating right?
Are you listening?
We enjoyed ourselves.
Tom is going to arrange everything.
You're forgetting him.
Tom is going to Nîmes tomorrow.
Mary made her children's Halloween costumes.
How much time will you be in Boston?
Why does the Quran say that infidels should be killed?
You're the love of my life.
I hate him, too.
Tom sat down next to his daughter.
Get everything.
The toponyms that I have just given are those of places of Djemaa-Saharidj village. Did you know that?
Everyone waited.
I don't want to live with you.
Tom seems interested in me.
Please bring us two cups of coffee.
They sent me a word.
Don't you think you speak French better than me?
The wise man masters his steps well.
Let him do it.
Tom likes to read.
I told Tom where I wanted to go.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Tom went looking for Mary.
They're gone.
She writes poems.
Stop crying.
I think of her day and night.
The play was a lot of fun. I wish you could have been there.
Stay cool.
You are jealous.
Where's your uncle?
She couldn't convince him to accept the bribe.
French is very difficult to learn.
I'm certain that we'll do it.
Bring backup.
I like trains.
I have already told Tom that Mary isn't here.
Everybody hates Tom.
There is nobody in this room.
That was amazing.
I bought some pizza.
Tom and Mary said they wished you wouldn't do that by yourself.
Jaffer betrays his people.
I can't read.
Are you able of swimming?
I am blind in the right eye.
Get everybody involved.
I hate working.
I need someone to help me do this.
They understood.
He was imprisoned.
You know I can't.
Someone stole my money.
"Do you like snakes?" "Of course not."
I had to tell somebody.
Stand still!
Memorize this.
Tom wanted to avoid Mary.
I have a guitar.
We'll meet again in October.
Are you eating right?
Let me hear from you.
Look around you.
Please stop.
Why don't you go to school?
How did you make them laugh?

Don't forget us!
Are you finished?
We made it.
Above all, be kind to old people.
That's your slave, right?
I hate losing.
Somebody has to go first.
Sami hopped in Layla's car.
I hope you'll hear me out.
Welcome.
Boycott Facebook.
I bought it.
There's nothing they don't need.
Have some.
Tom approved.
Several candles were burning.
Tom had never kissed anyone before.
Everyone gossips.
Tom knows you're lying.
What, again?
You talked to them, didn't you?
What a thing to say!
I'm retiring in October.
You suck.
Cheers!
Tom won't know that I'm here.
"The end of the world is not about to happen", said Titus Livus.
You're all racists.
You were praying.
Certainly!
I know you're right.
I’ll call you before I leave.
I can't go swimming with you today.
Drink lots of water.
Close your book.
When someone ignores you, forget about him.
Why are you crying?
She is reading.
Tom admires Mary.
He used to get up early.
Her hair grew back.
Watch her.
Tom admitted killing Mary.
You know the way.
What's wrong with going to Boston by myself?
Write Spanish.
You should ask somebody else.
He is not stupid.
It's so heavy that I can't lift it.
Please don't get angry.
What lovely flowers!
How can you not know?
Kabylia has always been autonomous even during the Turkish colonization of North Africa.
It looks like we might have to do that.
Kids, listen!
Stop shooting!
They have a problem.
Wash the apple before you eat it.
Tom said I needed to study French.
Tom is swimming.
They're probably sleeping.
Good news was in store for us at home.
Shut up!
I smell something burning.
Stop that!
I'd like to show you some translated texts for you to correct.
I don't know him.
Tell him I love you.
Did you hear what they were saying?
I hope no one saw you.
Mine's bigger than yours.
I confessed.
I like lemon tea.
Shut up!
I moved to Boston on October 20th.
I'll buy you that.
Tom was kidnapped.
Keep running.
Somebody will do that.
Get a haircut.
This clock loses three minutes a day.
Tom got sick.
Make it smaller.
How are you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
His eyes were red.
Tom was surprised when Mary didn't do that.
Are you thirsty?
Tom bowed.
I left my keys in the car!
Wait outside.
Do you like my friend?
Nobody listens.
My jaw hurts.
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
The police think Tom was stabbed before his throat was slit.
Tom doesn't have any idea what Mary is thinking.
Nobody remembers.
What is your father's name?
Atheism is natural. It's education which makes people believers.
I wouldn't allow you to go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
Can you speak French?
Tom hopes to be in Boston by late October.
What are you doing?
Help me.
Tom forgot Mary's phone number.
I satisfied you, right?
I speak French better than Tom.
Sami has been following me on Snapchat.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Send Tom to me.
He is one of the greatest scientists in Japan.
She lies.
Are you envious?
Don't leave the entrance unprotected.
Tom is the son of a famous professor in Boston.
Is it OK to say no?
I bought some fresh bread.
Those who waste water are not those who bring it back.
Why this destruction?
You're our prisoner.
Are you busy now?
Forget him.
We're a little busy right now.
How did you get that scar on your cheek?
Do you want me to call her?
I want you to stay in Australia at least until Christmas.
I hope to see you in October.
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Tom doesn't know I know.
That sounds great.
Your father is a good-looking man.
Tom was the last person to see Mary alive.
Tom is lying on the table.
Leave her.
Understood.
How I have missed you!
Tom glanced at the door again.
Are you stupid?
Tom never changes.
Tom has hired somebody to cook for him.
He likes reading books.
He went to see her while she was living in London.
Someone came.
The cat is black.
How are things in Australia?
Tom loves talking about art.
I need you to do something.
Sami didn't talk about Layla.
Let me see what you've written.
Tom has seen it, too.
Keep warm.
Tom is unmarried.
He was looking for his pen.
They understood.
Prices will increase after October 20th.
I'm expecting.
I can't see well.
You have only to keep silent.
Hello.
I don't have any money in my pockets.
Monotheistic religions are a big lie for humanity.
Everybody left.
You befooled me.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
What's preventing you from doing that?
I only have one question.
We don't use force unless necessary.
I wish I could play guitar.
Shut up!
You have only to go with me.
Both Tom and Mary don't know how to speak French.
Tom slapped Mary.
Read it.
Say hello.
How I have missed you!
Somebody's going to pay.
I like to watch westerns.
Tom hates Mary.
Please be quiet.
They are pretty.
Tom has many good ideas.
It's forbidden.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We had nothing to eat.
Are you ready to go?
Sami came into the store.
Please smile.
I'd like to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
Tom said he'd be back on October 20th.
Move quietly.
Contact her if you have any questions.
If you don't mind, I'll leave now.
We all hate you.
She might come.
What papers do you take?
Follow Tom.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Will your father eat dinner with you tonight?
I left Australia on October twentieth.
She loves him.
I'm going to go out and get us something to eat.
Be attentive.
The cough syrup that Tom recommended worked well.
He's showing his father his apartment.
We need to uphold laws against discrimination — in hiring, and in housing, and in education, and in the criminal justice system. That is what our Constitution and our highest ideals require.
When do you come and see me?
The coronavirus causes persistent coughing.
Just tell her what you need.
It's easy.
I will come with you.
Have you lost your reason?
Tom walked right past Mary.
Do only what I did!
You are guilty.
Tom has built a large house.
Someone stole my money.
Your writing is horrible.
I lied when I said I didn't like Tom.
Nobody got up.
I'm starting the work on the first day of July.
There are lots of things we could do to help those families.
I don't understand anything.
Tom will contact Mary.
Tom pulled out a map.
Mary's sentences are easy to translate.
They're mocking you.
You speak my language.
I'm happy here.
When Tom and I were in Boston, we visited Mary.
When you have time, read this.
Tomorrow I will see him.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
Tom was lucky.
What a thing to say!
Tom questioned Mary.
The road is long.
Try to keep him occupied.
Are you prepared?
Somebody is watching us.
You remind me of somebody.
Fasten your seatbelts.
We want to get to know you.
Does everybody love music?
I tripped.
Let the animals out of their cages.
Get dressed quickly.
But what do you want?
He stood up.
Tom and I despised Mary.
Perfect!
Everybody stayed.
Hang on.
Are you unhappy?
I forgot your number.
Hello, what is your name?
Tom and Mary knew that they had no choice but to do that.
The police are after us.
Very!
Are you a foreigner?
A huge crowd of people waited.
Tom waved goodbye to Mary.
Follow your dreams.
I'm going to show you how it's done.
Say good-bye to your friends.
Probably not.
Tom is drowning!
Tom realized that Mary was following him.
Time flew.
You're after Tom.
Read this book.
Tom knows that he isn't going to win.
They're still following us.
What time did you come home?
Is anyone hurt?
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Tom does the shopping.
This party isn't for you.
You are like the one who builds a house with waste boards
Everyone knows.
Nobody wants to work.
I brought you some food.
Tom made us sing.
Will you permit us to leave now?
The river is very deep.
Read this book.
I cannot get rid of it.
I like it very much.
I heard what happened.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
Have you become insane?
She hates the Algerian authority.
I'm on a diet.
This is my phone.
I may stay in Boston until October.
Do you care what other people think about us?
Muḥend Belqasem is giving live training on Facebook every Thursday.
Sami is an asshole.
If you want to leave, then leave now!
I've been looking all over for you.
I think that it's a beautiful place.
Tom said he'd only talk to you.
You're part of the problem.
Have we ever met before?
She speaks ten languages.
If you eat that, you'll die.
It's a race against time.
This is all we have.
I think I understand.
It's fairly warm today.
Is that Tom's sister?
Tom got burned.
Tom thought about Mary a lot.
Tom didn't talk about you.
Sweet dreams!
Tom says he's never driven a truck.
Did somebody say something?
I know that Tom is a billionaire.
She grimaced.
This will keep you warm.
I sure hope this is a dream.
Love has blinded you.
You make me feel dizzy!
Who complained?
Are you Julius?
Have you any further questions?
Tom is kind of strange.
You'll find somebody.
Stop shouting.
She is Kabyle.
He never tires of watching him.
Are you human?
All my problems are over.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Alice smiled.
To tell the truth, they are not husband and wife.
Please close that door with a key.
Embrace life!
I won't have to go there alone.
"I fear the rain," said the stone. "What would I say, me!" replied the clod of earth.
May God make you like the tiles so that each covers the other.
Somebody has to do it.
My son has become a man.
Can I ask a dumb question?
I've finally caught you.
Tom knows.
Did you call?
I lost.
He recently sent me a touching poem he wrote after his mother's death.
Wash your face.
Things happen.
Tom is a better singer than Mary is.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
Tom likes to play soccer.
Sami still has his guitar.
Everyone loves you.
Tom and I can't both be right.
Where's your grandmother?
Come outside.
Everybody jumped.
If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes.
Did you do all this?
Let them help you.
Are you helping him?
Neither Tom nor Mary has asked for help.
There is no trust where there is no democracy.
Those who are stung by wasps take their revenge on grasshoppers.
Tom and Mary are about the same size.
Did someone die?
No one cared.
Tom exaggerates.
Are you lying?
I don't think that it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing what I have to.
Sami read a message from Layla.
I want you to stand up.
You refused to pay.
Tom continued reading.
Are you lying?
Tom admired Mary.
You have to make this work.
I think you did that intentionally.
She's studying English.
Let me know.
Are you crazy?
Everyone cheered.
Tom and Mary are like John and Alice.
They are crazy.
You should be talking to Tom.
Who ran?
Tom's birthday is October twentieth.
Forget her.
A small spark often ignites a big flame.
Tom has an air of mystery about him.
I saw a dog.
I'm so afraid.
Save me.
The festival starts October 20th.
Tell me again who will be helping us.
I can't just leave you here.
Sami doesn't know who this lady is.
What's this fruit called?
Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you doing that.
I love the way you kiss me.
Have you got through with your work?
What language was that?
You're a very good student.
Is this art?
Somebody must've left it there.
Whose is it?
Are you shy?
Tom has many good ideas.
Walk!
Tom and I followed Mary.
Don't worry. It's easy.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom is dozing.
Join us.
If you don't want to read, don't.
Are you mad?
I bought a pair of earrings.
Jump across.
Let's go dancing.
Please.
Somebody had to do something.
They fell.
Have you finished?
Is this freak your friend?
Mary knows that we believe her.
Change your clothes.
We wanted to listen.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Look around you. What do you see?
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
Your philosophy of life varies from mine.
Sami was moving out that night.
Carry this.
Everyone giggled.
Tom thought that no one saw him.
What do you feed your dog?
I'm not your love.
Sami went to the game.
Tom moved to Boston in October.
The moon is still shining.
Thank you for your call.
I saw somebody.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom waited his turn.
Tom said he doesn't smoke anymore.
You make me feel dizzy!
Kurt Cobain died on 5 April 1994 in Seattle.
I'll be back in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom felt uncomfortable.
Hybridization concerns the mule.
She swims well.
I'll pay by cheque.
The debate is over.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Tom bought that for us.
I didn't want to go to the party.
I like reading.
Tom admitted he despised Mary.
Give me a kilo of tomatoes, please.
Save your strength.
Sami felt something hit his shoulder.
Ken is happy.
You should eat something.
Are we done?
Send me there.
Why did you write this book?
Tom wanted Mary.
Stop reading.
Nobody's been inside.
Say goodbye.
You can't stop us.
My old-fashioned grandfather complains about the way girls are dressed nowadays.
This is for you.
Don't forget to tell Tom to do that today.
Terrific!
Do you know that Zinedine Zidane is Kabyle?
Please feed the dog every day.
I have to visit Tom.
You're perfect for me.
Just let me in.
Are you Canadian?
You're mocking me.
I'm still seeing Tom.
The exhibit runs through October 20th.
Please.
What you say is true.
I'm supposed to go to Australia next week.
Is there somebody you want to call?
Awesome!
I can kill you.
Are you making him a sandwich?
Tom told me he likes you a lot.
Wash everything.
A tea with lemon, please.
I'm feeling fine now.
Free the animals from their cage.
They say that Tom's going to come back.
Thanks for calling.
Silence!
Sami and Layla were making out.
You look Japanese.
Go to school.
I prayed.
Sami taught Layla how to play the guitar.
You fainted.
I made you coffee.
Tom has already been warned many times.
Tom showed Mary something.
She is very wise.
These things happen.
Mary told me that she was lucky.
Does Tom pick on you a lot?
You drive me nuts!
It's not a problem anymore.
You are funny.
We must try again.
Somebody say something.
I regret kissing Tom.
You suck.
Look at my new car.
I voted.
You've got a fever.
We remember.
Who won?
Read this.
Tom will be missed.
I don't know if I have the time.
Was the umbrella you found Tom's?
Sami unholstered his pistol.
She understands him.
Tom said he likes studying French.
Somebody was in the house.
Tom contributed.
Examine them.
Listen, everybody!
Come anytime.
You are foolish.
You only have to follow him.
Tom looked me in the eye.
She might come.
I need someone to help me.
Why does Tom need my help?
You make me feel dizzy!
Will you really send me a Japanese doll?
Sami sees Layla once a year.
Join us.
You really don't need to do that.
Someone is watching Tom.
Well, have you decided?
Die!
Say good-bye to your friends.
Monkeys climb trees.
I did that without anybody's help.
Stop bothering me!
Tom has no plans to do that.
Sami did not need that.
I can go to your house tomorrow.
I won't go swimming today.
Your word doesn't mean anything.
Tom looked happy.
I was born in this hospital.
Are you Ukrainian?
I need you to do something.
Tell me the truth.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
You have lipstick on your teeth.
Give it to whomever you like.
Do you have many friends who don't eat meat?
Do you have time to eat?
Everyone giggled.
Tom asked us to be silent.
She was deadly tired.
Tell me something I don't know.
Who drew it?
Marie should start.
It's real.
Away with you!
You won't make mistakes.
Bees make honey.
I know.
Cut!
Are you studying?
You are human.
I survived.
Everyone waited.
Whenever you come, you are welcome.
Apes are intelligent.
Call them.
Is Tom joking?
Meet me there.
Somebody might stop us.
Someone is waiting for Tom.
Stop shouting.
Tell her.
I giggled.
Tom was working with Mary.
Tom is sweating.
She was the only one drunk at the party.
Do you know me? - No, I don't.
Tom can understand Mary.
Welcome, everyone.
Allah rocks!
I wish Tom would leave me alone.
You are as nutty as a fruitcake dude!
Do you know how this works?
Follow the example of your sister.
I worry about him.
Get everybody out.
Tom and Mary are as different as black and white.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
Tom is your father.
He sprained his foot.
Why don't you go to Tom's house?
You look lovely tonight.
Tom is having lunch now.
Tom died in October.
The work is progressing steadily.
Tom was right about Mary.
We all hate him.
They bought a bottle of water.
You were supposed to have done it yesterday.
Is this love?
Is there anything you don't like to eat?
Someone scratched my car.
I did not read.
Tom will save us.
The Lebanese student and her friends wrote books.
Tom has already decided to leave early.
Do it now.
Tom left the country on October 20th.
How do we buy British goods?
She has to take a rest.
You already paid.
Tom said doing that would be safe.
I already wrote it in Kabyle on Tatoeba; it's even been long time ago.
Who did you expect to win?
Tom loves fishing.
Soccer is very popular among Japanese students.
"I am about to melt," said the stone to the root ball. She replied, "What about me?"
I'm going to show you how it's done.
You know Tom needs to do that, don't you?
You are foolish.
There was enough water for two days.
You have cats?
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a gifted child.
Aren't you going to read this book?
You can't speak French, can you?
You are wrong.
She sits with him.
When is the next flight to Boston?
I heard you don't eat meat.
I obeyed.
Tom started his blog in October.
Do you intend to eat all that?
You're a very rude person.
Are you American?
Give me a different one.
I thought you couldn't read.
Your writing is horrible.
Tom almost died.
When the hen lays, it's the cock that has pain in the ass.
Stop them!
Tom only slept for a few hours.
Why are you looking at Tom?
Louder.
I didn't think Tom would be so tired.
Come anytime.
You can use my dictionary.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Read this now.
Tom exaggerated.
Did you swim yesterday?
Start here.
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom told her that he had written that poem two years before.
He stood there for a while.
I'm afraid for you.
Have you read this?
I laughed.
You are afraid.
You can go home now.
You're a dog.
Some children are swimming in the river.
How many sandwiches are left?
Thanks, everyone.
Tom's different.
Your being here has helped me a lot.
A young man went to his girlfriend's parents. While he was there, she cooked honey cake for him. When he returned, his mother, smiling, said to him, "Will there be a wedding soon?" "Yes, Mom!" he replied. "One taste, and I said yes!"

Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
Good afternoon.
I love trips.

Why weren't you paying attention to what the teacher was saying?
How would you like your eggs?
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
There is a piano in the room.
I went skiing a lot when I was a kid.
Tom and I are married now.
Somebody stole my lunch.
You drove.
What do you seek, human?
Get dressed.
What's your room number?
I'm telling the truth.
Do you have any friends?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
Tom sings better than Mary does.
I believe you like your job.
These notebooks aren't mine.
I made you coffee.
Tom was fired in October.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
Clean up your room.
Why don't you go see Tom?
Tom told me that he loves me.
Your philosophy of life is different than mine.
I'm an old friend of Tom's father.
This disturbs you, doesn't it?
Hasn't there been any change?
The game lasted too long.
Snow has been falling steadily since this morning.

Everybody danced.
Did you check her?
It's their last movie.
You are a bit fat.
Hungry?
Tom doesn't know exactly how to explain it.
Can I go home now?
You are lying.
Flattery won't get you anything.
Tom phoned to say he isn't coming.
Poetry is a therapy.
Do it again!
Sami started at that man.
Take cover!
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Step outside.
I've brought you lunch today.
Tom isn't going to be back until October.
Can you open the door for me?
Somebody knocked on the door.
Tom wanted to forget Mary.
Tom ran downstairs to see what the matter was.
I bet you can not even guess what it is!
Nothing hurts like the truth.
He is capable of doing it.
They sing.
I'm afraid it'll rain tonight.
He never keeps his word.
The computer broke.
If you have any problems, call.
They cheat.
Are you home?
I want to look rich.
You make me feel dizzy!
How I have missed you!
We're expecting company this evening.
We both hate her.
Don't forget rule number three.
I spoke French.
I won't tell anyone, I promise.
Someone stole my passport.

Tom was scared of Mary.
Sami was touching my things.
You should be talking to Tom.
Write it in French.
Something happened.
Go sit down.
Speak quietly.
Tom doesn't like to wait until the last minute to do something.
I've got to speak to Tom.
Tom was executed.
Remember!
Please don't die.
Tom is going to be thirty in October.
Sami is a very friendly person.
Do you hear me well now?
Breathe!
You have not heard the children.
I think Tom is courageous.
You have a very nice smile.
Whose is this book?
I'm pretty sure that Tom likes Mary.
Call him.
That car is quite new.
Your time has arrived!
They're mocking you.
Look ahead.
What happens next?
She stopped talking.
I want you to go with Tom.
The very sick baby was under careful observation by the doctors.
What does he say?
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
Without water, there's no life.
You are so beautiful.
You won?
We love studying music.
Get your carcass out of here!
My father didn't know her.
People speak French here.
Bring backup.
Tom hopes to return by late October.
Would you mind leaving the door open?
Idiot!
You must look to your manners.
Tom is prudent, isn't he?
You danced.
Somebody was talking to Tom.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
He speaks English well.
Tom was completely clueless.
You are morons.
Are you nuts?
I thank you for your gift.
Is this wine?
Take care.
Let's think about the worst that can happen.
Are you wealthy?
Tom's asleep.
I went to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
Comfort her.
Bite me!
Tom and Mary headed to her place.
He is a good writer.
Where's your aunt?
Tom ordered an extra large pizza.
She went blind.
I blinked.
Nobody's been inside.
I feel very lonely these days.
I wish you lots of bright stars and all the flowers you desire.
Let me be.
I suggest that that is not true.
Stay with me.
Which is your favorite team?
He was outraged.
So?
I'll dream about you.
Give examples.
Someone might see us.
What do you feed your dog?
Watch what you eat.
We studied English.
I am beside myself.
My computer crashed.
Just take me home.
You should leave me cool; otherwise, I will say a possible blunder.
Watch closely.
Pot calling the kettle black.
Tom and I both want to go.
I thank you for your kindness.
Step aside!
Tom said there was no one in there.
She stood up.
He is at home today.
Read it again, please.
Can I ask a dumb question?
Tom began talking.
Could you please wait a minute?
Let me remind you of something.
I never tried to do that again.
Can you please help me?
Do you think you can wait?
I will trust you with one secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You are so pretentious!
Somebody has to do something.
Tom is getting ready for a party.
Sami never received that last message.
Are you here?
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
Old people think they are the only ones who are right.
Did you read this?
I'll call on you on Monday.
No, I do not know your brother.
I'm not running.
What happens now?
Is this it?
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not washing your car.
I was born in Boston.
Dinner is ready to eat.
Free the animals from their cages.
They are familiar for me.
Would you like something to drink?
You're all happy.
If you ask me, it was just a waste of time.
Tom thought Mary would probably do that.
Who fights can lose. Who doesn't fight has already lost.
You are American.
Somebody is lying here.
Smell this.
Keep fighting.
It snows.
Do you have school today?
You refused to pay.
Did he check him?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were friends.
I'll write you a note.
I'll meet you downstairs.
That's the word.
Somebody's watching you.
Look ahead.
I like reading.
I am pleased at your success.
Thank you.
How many of those do we need?
Watch us.
I like traveling.
Tom and I used to be real good friends.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
Stay inside.
Tom comes to Boston every week to see Mary.
Tom did a very stupid thing.
Are you shy?
Tom put his feet on the floor.
Many thanks.
You can't go in with this.
How handsome you are!
Search me.
I just wanted to get married.
I enjoy reading.
Write it in French.
Are you doing that for me?
I know it's Tom's call.
Tom lives near the beach, but he can't swim.
I don't know how much it's going to cost.
Make another choice.
Stop shouting.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
Aren't you from here?
Are you expecting someone?
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
Tom turned back to Mary.
Please read that book.
We'll wait for you there.
Tom paused.
Tom misunderstood.
I told the truth.
Have you got a dog?
Are you envious?
Do you want food?
Stop fighting!
Tom can't trust Mary.
Somebody saw you.
We have read.
Problem solved!
Everybody blames you.
Answer me.
Tom is undressing.
We have to save him immediately.
We'll send somebody.
You sure eat a lot.
I'm trying to think of another plan.
How much chocolate did you eat?
How's Tom?
This must be stopped.
Tom is sick.
Did somebody hit Tom?
Tom adores Mary.
What is your greatest fear?
Send me somebody right away.
Bring food.
Who's your favorite writer?
The dog is barking.
Are you expecting Tom?
I wish you a year of peace and happiness.
She stopped talking.
Guess again.
You're lucky.
You can change that if you want.
Stop touching me.
Tom only wants one cup of tea.
Try to keep Tom occupied.
Forgive me.
How I have missed you!
You simply have to call Jean.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
Stop yelling!
You need to blame somebody.
Tom hated Mary.
Did you read that?
I really appreciate your coming.
I made Tom suffer.
I hope nothing happened to him.
Follow your path.
The word "family" has 3 syllables.
You're in Boston.
I'll give you a call tomorrow night.
I have something to give you.
Form two lines.
He likes tigers.
Tom can rest as long as he wants.
Sami was reading a message from himself to Layla.
His gaze wandered through the auditorium.
I know that I can count on you.
Who are you?
Forget Tom.
Welcome to Canada!
It won't happen again.
They live there.
Someone's talking.
I should be there pretty soon.
I'll come help you.
Everyone's out.
You must bear it in mind.
Keep warm.
Are you eating right?
You are stupid.
I know that you're here, Tom.
She keeps secrets.
Why are you cursing?
It won't be a difficult thing to do.
Send Tom to me.
What are you going to do?
Turning the tide, you are on the incoming wave.
Take care.
Somebody made a mistake.
I didn't mean to step on your foot.
Two beers, please.
Tom gave a cup of coffee to Mary.
I could hardly wait to see you.
Stop laughing.
I need to buy something to eat.
Jim is coming to the party, too.
Come into my room.
Tom didn't come back.
Do you remember?
Stop arguing.
By the way, Tom still wants to go out with you.
Speak out!
Tom wants Mary.
Tom is bald.
Tom screamed.
I haven't seen Tom in three days.
Are you brothers?
I'm at a loss for words.
I don't like you anymore.
Don't give Tom too much credit.
I want to know who is coming with us.
The top execs are gathering for a power breakfast.
Have you vomited yet?
Tom lived with his parents in Australia.
Pass me the salt, will you?
Where's your aunt?
Somebody's waiting for you.
Show me your true face.
All right.
It happened that I was in her room.
Keep walking.
Tom winked.
You shall have my car.
Tom took a cold shower.
The rabbit was a coward and they made it worse for him with drums.
What do we call you?
Did you read everything?
Sami is talking with his hands.
I believed everything they told us.
Tom has told us so much about you.
Tom remained silent.
Tom is my date.
Are you going to leave me?
Have you brushed your teeth?
I think he's gone nuts.
Do you want eggs?
Please remember me to all your family.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
Can I see the menu, please?
Do you like dogs?
Stay away from that place.
The floor was covered with blood.
I know that I can count on you.
He is Kabyle.
Tom can't come today.
Where should we eat?
Your time will come.
They appointed Mr. White as manager.
You are taller than she.
You walk quickly!
They smiled.
Somebody has to do something.
What's your philosophy?
Put your coat on. It's cold outside.
Who took my computer?
Be courteous.
I do like you.
Come try.
I don't want to leave you here on your own.
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
Tom didn't go to the same school as Mary did.
Tom has no choice but to stay.
Wash your teeth before sleeping!
Away with you!
Please fix it.
Tom is planning on going alone.
I'm starting a new life.
That ceremony was on October 20, 2013.
Aren't you hungry?
I think that it's a beautiful place.
I had to tell somebody.
Have you become insane?
Tom reads slowly.
Please lend me your car.
Did they check them?
She sat there in silence.
Somebody had to do that.
Are you Swedish?
I live in Australia.
I think Tom is ugly.
You are lying.
Do you know how to program?
I've been in Boston for three months.
Don't talk about it.
I just wanted somebody to help me.
Death is preferable to shame.
The car stopped.
Choose carefully.
Tom was released from prison in October.
I knew it.
I understand your reasons.
Why are you crying?
We want to get to know you.
You must eat.
Big snowflakes are falling.
Everyone screamed.
Have you already read this?
Would you like me to go there with you?
I saw him no more.
Is Tom from Australia?
Do you ever ride your bicycle to school?
I think Tom is up to something.
Be reasonable.
Hands off.
Is he Japanese?
This conference is good.
When are you going to consider me your friend?
Somebody help me.
What do you want from Tom?
Please telephone him.
Who is she with?
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
Why did Tom hesitate?
Are you OK?
Let's eat now.
I don't think I like it.
How lucky.
We left on October 20th.
I thought you would recognize Tom.
Tell her.
Be punctual.
Stop making fun of me.
This I have done.
Tom and the other farmers prayed for rain.
Everyone loves you.
Tom isn't our son.
He found you awake.
Somebody might stop you.
It's October 20th.
Tom was the one who told me the story.
Are you ready?
Put some paper in the copy machine.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Tom told me he saw somebody kissing Mary.
Stop crying.
I was a bit unlucky.
You are taller than I.
My mother made me a new dress.
Are you lucky?
I fainted.
They know the truth.
I hope you're doing well.
I red ten books this month.
I knew I'd forgotten something.
We built it.
Tom clapped.
Do you smell something?
She swims well.
They are surprised.
Did Moses really hear God speaking?
You are dead.
No one is going to help us.
Go now.
Eat slowly.
Oh, hush!
Check that.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
We'll be getting married in October.
Tom called me.
You must eat.
Tom isn't dead.
Somebody was murdered.
His idea is superior to yours.
Does he have a sister?
Keep away.
Watch your toes.
Hot outside?
Please repeat.
You seemed to like that.
I've been thinking about it the entire day.
He is intelligent.
Do you come back from Tibet?
Close your eyes, open your mouth.
She walks.
I've been teaching French for more than thirty years.
You ought not to call at this time of night.
Is this where you live?
Have you any idea what you've done?
I believe you.
Close your book.
Why don't you sit down? The place is free.
They are very alike to me.
Stop studying!
This place is crawling with ants.
Did you eat your spinach?
Go slow.
My fate is in your hands.
Registration began October 20th.
Do you still eat meat?
Just talk with them.
Everybody spoke French.
I missed you very much.
Tom tried to warn Mary.
Tom told me you didn't win.
I am your father.
What are those people doing?
If you had only listened to me, none of this would have happened.
Hug me.
What's new?
Are you tired?
Watch this.
Cut!
So, why are you here?
Tom almost drowned.
No one knows what the future holds.
I couldn't do this without your help.
I love life.
Do you see anyone here?
What's the plan?
Ghosts exist.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
Reading and writing in Kabyle has become our duty.
You whispered.
It's a critical situation.
You seemed stressed.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French very well.
I'm going to order some more french fries.
Someone's calling.
Everybody laughed.
Red wine, please.
He lost his honor.
Tom isn't able to feed himself.
Tom wanted our help.
I was in my apartment.
I sell computers.
The accentuation can be very different from one language to another.
We're going to Boston with Tom and Mary.
I just don't love Tom.
Everybody jumped.
Do you need any help, buddy?
She has three brothers.
They're asleep.
I'm no friend of yours.
Tom can show Mary.
Tom graduated.
Tom said he likes studying French.
If you want your money back, you can have it.
They left early.
Keep listening.
Tom was impressed by Mary.
Mary burped.
Are you home?
Tell me when you'll call me.
I love what you are.
Please, where are you from?
Have you become insane?
Somebody could get hurt.
None of those books are useful.
Why are you cursing?
Somebody's waiting for you.
Tom plays the flute better than Mary.
Tom says that he's in good shape.
He gave them back to you.
He ran.
You're wet through.
Do you think I'll survive?
Tom shaved.
He is not what he was.
Today you can eat as much as you want.
Are they coming as well?
We played chess.
Look behind you.
I'm here because of you.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Sami had a lunch break.
Do you think anyone can see me?
There's not much to say.
Tom has been talking on the phone for an hour.
You are beautiful.
Tom got flustered when filling out the paperwork.
I hate Tom.
No one's looking.
Tom told me not to go there alone.
What do you want to do?
Come and see me.
You should read this.
Are you handicapped?
Sami was singing in the church.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
Please correct it.
I don't like to eat where people are smoking.
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Write me.
Kill me.
He runs.
Did you speak with your wife?
Why are they so afraid?
I'm still in Australia, but I'll be back home the day after tomorrow.
Tom opened a bottle of beer.
I love Australia.
Loosen it.
I'm going to go.
Tom burned himself.
They stopped.
You're all alone.
School begins tomorrow.
He did not enter or exit.
Tom passed away on October 20th, 2013.
Is someone in there?
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
Someone is watching Tom.
Tom and Mary split up last week.
You had better have your hair cut.
Who do you suspect stole your wallet?
I was profoundly disturbed by this news.
I like reading books.
Such a marmalade
If you have any questions, please call.
You are an idiot!
I always stay in a bar.
You're a problem.
I called out.
Everyone for himself.
You are an idiot!
I'll go to Boston in October.
Are you eating right?
Stay with me.
Her work is better than mine.
History repeats itself.
Beer is my fuel.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
I ate some peanuts.

Does Tom pick on you a lot?
Have you finished?
Do you think I should do this?
Do you like dogs?
It's a race against time.

Don't tease him.
He came back at six.
This is a bee.
Jump down.
Tell him tomorrow.
They helped us.
Does Tom pick on you a lot?
I feel old.
Are you teachers?
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Tom and Mary are doing that by themselves.
Someone unlocked the door.
Stand up!
I want to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom danced.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
If you don't want to do it, don't!
He is not there.
Give me some milk, too.
The moon is already shining.
You pig!
Could you please wait a minute?
The problem is solved.
Your hour has arrived!
Take that.
Stop them.
I think you were wrong.
They have plenty of money.
Tell me the truth.

What are you doing?
Take these.
Today was fun.

I know it takes courage to do that.
Something's different.
Take the medicine every hour.

I won't forget this.
She doesn't smile for me anymore.
Tom speaks.
I can't help Tom today.
I met her on my way here.
I am not myself.
And so?
Stop there.
In fact, he even loved her.
I'm afraid for you.
Mary is a nice girl, except that she talks too much.
Did you buy this in Boston?
These sentences are not proverbs. These are figures of speech heard from our elders.

I'll probably go to Boston in October.
I demand the truth.
Give me some milk, too.
Sami was traveling across Egypt in his car.
I want to rent a house in Australia and stay for a year.

In our house, it is the custom for everyone to wash their own dishes.
Carry this.
I should read the book.
I'm a little busy.
Listen here!
Somebody might've overheard you.
I've already told you that I'm not the one who did that.

Take this pill. It'll help you sleep.
I can't remember your name.
Tom didn't care who was watching.
Mary made Halloween costumes for the kids.

Here's your order.
Are you lying to me?
Somebody's listening.
Are you from Kyoto?
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
I can jump.
You are a panda.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
Was everyone listening?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom did as Mary suggested.
Try to keep her occupied.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
Spring is here.
I don't know how much it's going to cost.
I've wronged you.
The debate is over.
Your mother eats shit.
It's best to tell the truth.
Eat and drink up.
They're using you.
Are you sincere?
Tom knocked him down.
I'll call you this evening.
Did Tom say he'd stay in Australia?
Tom visited Australia last summer.
Have you become insane?
He's going to kill me.
Tom could be in Australia by October.
I love snow.
Are you that stupid?
Lie still.
Keep looking.
Are you human?
Memorize it.
You're not going to die here.
Everyone thinks so.
Step inside.
My feet are dirty.
Sami asked Layla to do him a favor.
Not true?
Tell him.
Try some.
Somebody is following us.
I went, too.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
Somebody poisoned us.
Are you a Buddhist?
Many countries have laws prohibiting smoking.
Is it black?
Room for rent.
Maybe I can come to Boston in October.
You're in Boston.
But what is it?
I walked alone.
You are thirsty.
We have until October to complete our plan.
Hello honey.
I knew I wouldn't win.
How interesting!
I'll meet you there in five minutes.
Tom and I've never been close friends.
I'm going to buy three tickets.
I wanted to be a farmer.
Please come here.
Doing your best is better than doing nothing at all.
Someone's calling.
Questions will rain on the casual reader. He is required to answer each of them.
I'm Tom's ex.
Do you mind my smoking?
Are they hard of hearing?
You look good in black.
I'm used to the heat.
I don't like eating alone.
Didn't you know any of this?
Tom says that he wants to do that.

Somebody has to talk.
Have you become insane?
Bring them something to eat.
Everybody spoke French.
We would never do it.
Something's different.
They wouldn't tell me how Tom died.
Where are you staying?
When will you eat lunch?
Why don't you go outside and play?
Love is making you blind.

Please repair this.
Go slow.
They have company.

You can use this dictionary.
Call them.
Get down.
Why do you want all that?
Sami was there.
Why didn't you come to Boston last summer?
Somebody is following us.
He likes a walk.
Where's your God now?
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
We met for the last time.
Does that make you happy?
Were you surprised to see her?

They're inside.

You must be careful.
My skirt is too long.
You're new here, aren't you?
Get moving.
Your smile always makes me happy.
Fix this.

Last year, I visted Dubrovnik.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
Australia is no exception.
Tom and Mary have already kissed.
Tom is a Christian.
What book are you reading?
Tom will forgive Mary.
I've been learning to drive.
I've already told Tom that I plan on staying in Australia for another three weeks.
Neither Tom nor Mary wants to do that.
I had a little difficulty in getting a taxi.
May I?
I have a headache.
It is about time we were leaving.
I need help now.
Can I talk to you privately?
Subject closed.
The woman to whom you were talking is my sister.
Somebody might stop me.
Tom overslept.
Tom fell.
You're not used to drinking much water.
Exactly!
Look out!
The leaves fell.
I slept, and you?
During the night the wind blew cold.
Tom doesn't respect Mary.
Call me.
You had to study English.

There's nothing there.
What you have in your heart is on your face.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Do you like Germany?

I'm very proud of you.

Leave Tom.
I just spoke to her.
Come on!
You should've done that with us.
Let's sleep on it.

You should eat breakfast every day.
Listen to this!
Somebody just called.
We don't think that's true.

Be respectful.
I went to Boston on Monday.
I'll give you a ring on today.
You're older than Tom.

Don't forget to tell Tom that he has to do that.
Are you sick?

Someone is watching you.
Fish, please.
I want to know what you'd like to eat.
That was fabulous.
Sami wants to stay home.
Are you alone?
Nobody dies.
Be careful!
Haven't you had your dinner?
Where did he go?
Tom was hired in October.
Tom married an older girl.
"Do you believe him?" "Not really!"
Tom seems to be very rich.
He who does not say a word consents.
I've already explained it to you twice.
You are right.
Stand up, please.
Tell the truth.
You are mad.
Well done!
You had better have your hair cut.
Donate your money to the poor and you'll have treasure in heaven.
That's quite an art.
I never forgot you.
I'm a human.
Have you seen the new film?
Everybody jumped.
Say that again.
Where is the pen?
I don't eat fruit.
What'll you eat tomorrow?
When is Tom coming back from Boston?
Let me be.
Give it to whomever you like.
Tom took Mary's place.
She took my hand.

Did you call?
Ignore it.

I want to eat here tonight.
Do you see the star?
Do you write in French?

Two beers, please.
You're older than Tom.

If you're happy to, have some.
Switzerland is the country of the railways.
Arabic is not my language, I am Kabyle.
Are you sisters?
October was worse.
Did you read this?
Perhaps not.
There's somebody in there.

I prefer to read.
Open the door.
Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
Tom is your father.
Tom was the first one to finish the test.
This time it's different.
I apologize.
It is raining.
He went to see her while she was living in London.
Somebody just called.
I want you to work with them.
October was a busy month.
We've all missed you.
I must study.
Take Tom home.
I eat here.
Nothing hurts like the truth.
I ate.
I didn't stay in Boston for very long.
What do you want from us?
Tom wanted to marry Mary.
Tom cannot drive.
Sami knows where she lives.
Why does Tom need my help?
I shouldn't have kissed Tom.
You do not help me.
I won't eat at home tonight.
Watch her.
You are happy.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
He took a basket and went straight to the market.
Hold this.
When are you off?
Sami got tired of Layla.
Why are you crying?
Such a fake! Do you think that they will lay down their guns? You must be kidding!
At nightfall, people go home.
Everybody was really happy.
A fire broke out during the night.
Why are you alone?
I love parties.
Come try.
Get your hand off me.
We haven't abandoned you.
Swimming is good for your health.
France is a republic.
Hold tight.
You have only to wait here.
Tom is with somebody.
Mary built it.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Somebody knocked on the door.
Sami used to eat a lot of fast food.
You're gonna have a little sister.
Tom lacks motivation.
She lost everything she had.
After you.
Who stood?
Grab Tom.
Tom said that he knew who did it.
Tom is rich.
I won't discuss this with her.
I wonder what the fuss is all about.
What is your friend's name?
I told you it would work.
You are mad.
Love makes you blind.
Football is like a religion in this country.
I'm not going.
I'm undressing.
You walk quickly!
Goodbye, Ian.
Don't hold your rival cheap.
Stop them.
If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Step aside.
Are you blind?
Eat everything you wish.
How much longer do we have to wait?
Life is sweet.
It's windy.
How cute!
Why didn't you bring it home?
Tom wanted to comfort Mary.
This dictionary isn't useful at all.
Have you found something?
Whenever you come, you are welcome.
Do you blame Tom?
Don't touch.
I find you very boring.
Everyone's out.
What do you want from Tom?
Why do you want all this stuff?
Do you think I talk too much?
If Tom can't do it, nobody can.
I really have to eat something.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
Are you hungry?
They have a problem.
Get dressed.
Tom's defiant.
How long has Tom been teaching French?
I play the guitar.
Why not?
I'll ask Tom to do that.
Have you found something?
I guess Tom really loves me.
I like sleeping.
Tom and Mary both had the same idea.
We all hate you.
Do you know Tom's password?
You can get in touch with Tom at his home tonight.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
Sami was in Tahiti.
Try to keep Tom from doing that.
Identify yourself.
Nobody knows why.
Is this love?
Are you sick?
Tom could see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
Are you polite?
I heard somebody talking.
Tom thought I was Mary.
Which boy?
We do not have a book.
How many eggs do you eat a week?
Tell Tom what you need.
Someone's talking.
Have you read this?
I'm expecting a phone call this morning.
What does all this mean?
You must keep to the rules.
Do good to those who hate you.
What do you want?
Stop sniffling.
It was really sad.
I need somebody to talk to.
Say 'ahhh'.
I don't love Tom.
Let me see what you've written.
Keep smiling.
Paper burns quickly.
We need more evidence.
Whenever you come, you are welcome.
Is there somebody you want to see?
You have only to go with me.
Be yourself.
You had plenty of time.
However, I was only guessing: great tragedies have always occurred.
Are you Canadian?
I'd love to do it again.
Tom's house doesn't have a garage.
Somebody has to talk.
I respect you.
October 20th was a busy day.
Suddenly, it started raining very hard.
Tom drives much faster than Mary drives.
Write your name.
Somebody was murdered.
No one spoke.
If you want your money back, you can have it.
I can't agree with you on this matter.
This is our car.
I believe you.
Do whatever you want to do.
I was tired of watching TV.
No one ate the cake.
Could I have a second helping?
Everybody waited.
Success depends on your own exertions.
Which tooth hurts?
Please come over if you have time.
Tom lied.
How much cheese did you eat?
May I see a menu, please?
Watch yourselves.
Tom tried to save Mary.
Tom regrets having agreed to do that.
You need somebody like me.
Tom is your father.
I don't think I like that.
Are you angry?
Take everything.
Does Tom drink?
Sami saw Layla leave Walmart.
What are you going to do with that?
I read it wrong.
Who invited you to the party?
Tom kissed Mary.
They jumped.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
The pen you're holding now is mine.
What were you telling him?
Tom and I'll be neighbors soon.
How much time will you be in Boston?
Tom likes French.
He stayed at home.
Keep that.
What do you want to say to me?
Snow year, corn year
Snow is pretty, but it's cold.
Away with you!
I have to find a way out of here.
He went to a bar to drinks some beers.
I think Tom is too old for me.
Be watchful.
Do we have one?
Please be quiet.
Sami trusted his mom.
I couldn't do otherwise.
Hokkaido lies in the north of Japan.
Tom was born in Australia.
They waited.
Did you hear what they were saying?
I'm expecting.
Who told you Tom would be here?
Can you take a picture of us?
How would they find out?
Suddenly he saw me.
Write Tom.
Are you OK?
You seem busy.
It looks like I got here too early.
I've never tried riding a unicycle.
Tom ran outside to see what was happening.
Tom is the kind of man I like.
Who survived?
Tom stopped at a rest area.
Halloween's celebrated in October.
Why don't you do something?
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Are you new?
Come in.
The cat is safe.
You work hard.
Somebody came to our house.
My husband is a good man.
Tom looks about ready to explode.
Tom says that he's never heard Mary sing.
It seems I was sleeping.
Tom is going to Boston in October.
You will never love me as I love you.
Who speaks French?
Do you own a house in Australia?
Leave them.
Tom inhaled.
A mustache suits Tom.
I like swimming.
Somebody has been sleeping on this sofa.
You have a green book.
Tom and Mary are thinking about buying a house.
Tom told me he saw somebody kissing Mary.
I like apples.
I went to a Halloween party.
Who spoke?
We succeeded.
I believed you.
I'm stuck here in Australia.
I know everything.
I'm freezing.
Have you read it?
It's dead.
Tom got home three hours after that.
Tom unleashed his dogs.
I love you bunches.
Go home quickly.
Tom entered the kitchen.
You're dead.
We're positive that they forgot to call us.
Those apples are big.
I am beside myself!
They won.
It would be easy for you to do that.
You don't have a heart.
Stay put.
You are an idiot!
Somebody had to do it.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
I prepared a poem, do you want me to read it for you?
Can you please help me?
Did she check them?
Thank you for telling us that.
It's my brother's.
They're all dead.
Is that Tom?
Learn!
We need a car.
I don't eat raw fish.
Call them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom is shaking.
When I return from the mosque where I pray, I like to drink a cup of wine before going to bed.
She built it.
I'm going to be thirty in October.
Take your time.
Tom is really heavy.
Tom stood.
No worries!
It's already time to go home.
Come over.
Sami bought two wigs from Amazon.
Take that!
Are you hiring?
Did Tom work for you?
The words "qeṛṛeṭ" and "qeṛṛeḍ" have the same root as "qeṛṛiḍ": they refer to the frostbite of the fingers which could cause until their amputation.
Girls are crazy.
You're all mad.
Sami is getting bullied.
Tom likes French.
Stop smoking.
Can any of us speak Spanish?
Don't eat that.
Tom didn't see it.
Send me there.
Which of your brothers is the oldest?
That sometimes happens.
Why did you call?
I continued singing.
Everyone knows that's Tom's car.
Is she smoking?
He changed his look a lot.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
I understand.
Tom is yelling.
Tom didn't stop Mary.
Tom changed jobs.
These are birds.
There is no hope of his recovery.
Okey doke.
Stop fighting!
I'm here as a friend.
You'd better not do that while Tom is here.
Those girls are both in love with you.
Tom and I haven't known each other long.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Could you give this to Tom?
I finally met Tom today.
Nothing is as precious as love.
I'll be in Boston until October 20th.
Where did you learn Italian?
Let's try something.
I will come with you.
Stop screaming.
Did you see my sister?
Layla shaved her legs.
Look, look!
Tell them the truth.
We won.
I don't wash your car.
I met a man whose father knows Tom.
I'm not here to hurt you.
You are fired.
Sami ran out to the hallway.
Smile.
Someone unlocked the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready?
I want to eat Chinese food for dinner.
Put your room in order.
You must keep to the rules.
She is Kabyle.
We are expecting company this evening.
Listen!
The church is affiliated with the Protestant Church of Algeria, an umbrella organization for Protestant churches.
You're a disaster in the kitchen.
Somebody attacked Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
You don't eat very fast, do you?
Life goes on.
Did the scientific Adam really exist?
I love what you are.
Tom has been talking about you all day.
Nobody went there.
They lost.
You should eat something.
This way.
I asked Mr Smith.
Your sister is lazier than all the other students.
You can't go in with this.
That sounds great.
The boy stole money from his mother's handbag.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were still doing that?
Tom contacted Mary.
What time was it when you got here?
Look around you.
You are reading.
Help us.
Who are you?
I feel terrible.
Tom had no idea Mary liked him.
Boys and girls play together.
Your eyes are lying.
Nobody knew.
I am listening to the music.
I'm at Tom's.
Tom didn't ask Mary to help.
He was put in jail for writing the book.
I know your language.
Art is long, life is short.
Tom is ready to work.
I don't want to talk about my child.
Tom and I are newlyweds.
Tom crashed.
I haven't seen Tom since Halloween.
Forget it.
We can do anything.
He ran.
Tom watches Mary.
Sami woke up to pray fajr.
Who will fill in for Tom when he is away?
Somebody wants to send a message.
Tom died of cancer in October.
I take it that you know how to do that.
They are the same age.
Nobody told me it was going to get this cold.
You do not help me.
It's Ṛabaḥ he's back.
I trust him.
October 20th was a hot day.
Truth prevails.
His way of thinking is very childish.
Tom is a gifted child.
What did you go there for?
Where are your dogs?
Tom remained skeptical.
What're you going to do this weekend?
The job is half done.
All violence comes from religion.
Tom struggled to keep his eyes open.
Keep climbing.
Our dog is black.
Your mother eats shit.
Mary is cooking.
Tell me something I don't know.
Is everything OK with you?
They like their Kabyle language.
I'm sure you'll find a way to do it.
Somebody's watching us.
I know who he is.
Wait outside.
That moved me deeply.
I want somebody else.
Clean the room.
You're hiding something.
Are you there?
Didn't you know Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
Tom wanted to scare Mary.
Freindship is good when there is understanding.
You fool, I had to do it!
Snow melts.
Somebody has left his hat.
Snow lay all over the ground.
Somebody intervened.
Tom gets to do whatever he wants to do.
Please don't get angry.
Somebody stole my car.
Did you call?
You're the love of my life.
When Kabyle bread is hot, olive oil is added.
Are you not tired?
Does everybody love music?
I was in Boston last year on October 20th.
Come here quickly.
I'm not your slave!
Why are you alone?
No one is answering.
This is true.
I turned right.
I wonder why Tom turned down that job.
I don't need your job.
Naomi is very glad about having won first prize.
Tom wasn't kissing Mary.
I'll see you at dinner.
Tom has done a great job for us.
I wonder if he loves me.
Amayas likes to eat acorns.
Pass me the salt, please.
Tom is patient.
How are you, Tom?
Good. No absentees.
It's a beautiful life.
I had lost my pen.
Who went with you?
Are you ready?
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Tom has since retired.
Are you there?
She took a basket and went straight to the market.
He began to feel afraid.
Get your carcass out of here!
Take your shoes off before you enter.
In a week, it will be two months since I write in the lying position; even if it is binding, the Kabyle language still needs to be worked on. What else would its speakers be for, then?
Please respond.
Is there somebody you want to call?
The bride looked very beautiful.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom was on leave in October.
Kiss him.
May I go home now?
They didn't see anything.
Tom and I haven't seen each other for a long time.
I hate fighting.
Tom kept reading.
I didn't say Tom wasn't smart.
Everybody is fine.
Stalin died and all Algerians cried.
What Tom said makes no sense.
Mary rented a wedding dress.
But do you love us?
Are you German?
Maybe Tom needs to do that, too.
She kissed me.
Somebody's coming.
Tom is the one who told me Mary didn't like him.
They have wine.
We can!
Are you dying?
She is scared to death.
Come here.
Have you had an answer?
Tom attacked Mary.
You know a few things about your family?
Everyone survived.
Do you have a brother, Ana?
Have courage.
Nobody knows why.
Are people listening?
I was about to go out when the phone rang.
You can have some if you want.
I make €100 a day.
Tom never forgot.
Tom slammed the door angrily.
We are a light for the sight.
He wrote him a message.
Get everything.
You know very well how it happened.
Did anybody ask Tom why he did it?
Tom knows.
Let me be.
I heard otherwise.
This plan was approved last October.
Tom slept late.
Tom and Mary sat way in the back.
Is today Friday?
Go on.
Have some coffee.
They agree.
Are not you ashamed of yourself?
I want to travel with you.
Coffee does harm to your stomach.
You're to come with me.
Was anyone listening?
I've come to talk with you again.
Someone stole my money.
Did you know Mary before she joined the team?
Exercise is good for you.
Ask around.
Today I dreamed I was dead.
Keep smiling.
We overslept.
I could hardly sleep last night.
To change the subject.
My parents are Kabyle.
Send this letter by air.
My upper left back tooth hurts.
We learned French.
How did you enjoy your time in Boston?
Tom forgot.
We have until October to get this done.
Why don't you join me?
Tom hasn't been here since October.
Come eat!
Do you have anything hot to drink?
I am pleased at your success.
Are you stupid?
Tom arrived.
Sami arrived in Egypt.
You sound surprised.
Our eyes should meet when we shake hands with each other.
She doesn't smile for me anymore.
Values melt like snow in the sun!
Tom can wait.
This is also untrue.
Fuck it.
I had to tell somebody.
I'm here because of you.
Tom heard the sound of breaking glass.
Mary doesn't ever kiss her husband in public.
Check around.
Listen to this!
Tom and I talked about many things.
Step inside.
Eat up.
Are you afraid of horror movies?
You make me feel dizzy!
After Tom graduated from high school, he went to Australia.
The stores are closed on Sunday.
Read through the article.
I'm in Tel Aviv.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
The beard doesn't care about us. It abounds on purpose to remind us of our depression, when we have too much.
I thank you for your kindness.
Show it to Tom.
Write Tom.
Let me go!
Brush your teeth clean after each meal.
Don't mock me.
Are you Japanese?
Bring backup.
Everyone ignored them.
Let's go for a walk after it stops raining.
Someone is waiting for Tom.
Are they new?
You see?
That smells delicious.
I am crazy about you.
It's unbelievable.
I'm not your slave!
Brian, in his pajamas, is engaged in reading in the house in the morning.
Love is blind.
Someone is watching you.
You could kill someone.
Their suitcase is too heavy.
Are you mad?
Bring her home.
Why do you want my help?
I jumped.
How are you?
Somebody called the police.
I can't do that for you now.
Come into my room.
I can't tell you the truth.
I apologized to Tom for what I did.
Karl Marx said: Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.
Tom looks impatient.
I took this picture in Boston on October 20th.
You have not heard the children.
Come along.
What a paella!
Away with you!
Tom poured us some tea.
Who ordered pizza?
How will I find it?
Did you call?
The worst has passed already.
I'm obliged not to do that.
Turn down the television.
I changed.
Work slowly.
You make me feel dizzy!
I almost drowned.
I read books.
Who are they with?
Are you mad?
She smiled.
Why do you want all these?
I followed him.
Have you eaten?
Sami and Layla were co-workers.
Have you got a bike?
They will find them.
Tom would have walked.
Snow is very good for the groundwater levels.
The people love freedom.
She doesn't have any friends.
It needs to be repaired.
Who's talking?
Religion causes war.
Gesundheit!
This medicine will make you sleepy.
I willingly eat sweets.
Make it short.
Keep walking.
Chicken again?
His gaze wandered through the auditorium.
Perhaps not.
Hang on.
It looks like you are from India.
What time was it when you got here?
Who remembers?
Tom walked with Mary.
It costs too much.
He knows how to play with words.
Call me when you land.
You are foolish.
Tom was eager to get home to Boston.
Your daughter's very attractive.
Don't lean against the wall.
Tom died in Boston on October 20, 2013.
Tom said you wouldn't try.
Is there anything we can do?
My foot is small beside yours.
I love Korean food.
If you don't mind, I'll leave now.
He bought it.
Mary belched.
Lol!
Tom wanted to see Mary.
What a brilliant idea!
Be respectful at least.
Eat shit — millions of flies cannot be wrong.
You should have absolute rest.
Tom didn't want Mary doing that by herself.
Even children can read this book.
You are so tall!
Tom loves books.
You can read this book.
Forgive Tom.
Try!
Flowers bloom.
I stayed at home.
Somebody's watching you.
Tom refused to eat lunch.
Nobody cares who you are.
I've already told everyone.
Are you doing that for me?
Stop singing.
I need somebody to talk to.
Are you afraid?
Hit Tom.
Someone said, "I met two lipstick bombshells whispering. I did not catch anything."
Man created God to avoid killing each other.
Please introduce me to a cute girl.
I'll buy paper, and other things that I need.
Go warm up.
Get down.
I told them not to tell you.
I like the Catalan language.
Boston was fantastic.
Toward midnight, I fell asleep.
Read it again.
General de Gaulle visited the village Tizi Hibel.
Ask around.
When you have time, read this.
Stop fighting!
Keep quiet!
Slowly!
Tom now lives in Australia.
Could somebody get me a spoon?
Tom said he has to get more sleep.
Know thyself!
I want to spend time with Tom.
Do you know what you're doing?
I'll tell you the truth.
I don't drink coffee.
Sami finds this very annoying.
Did you find your letters?
He reads the newspaper.
Do you know my wife?
Run!
You are childish.
The toponym Tunis comes from the root "ens", a night camp for troops.
Tom drives slowly.
Ask Tom.
I'm dying for you.
Keep out.
What is your philosophy?
Tom reads a lot.
Can I eat that orange?
Nobody laughed.
Tom seems to turn into a different person when he speaks French.
Answer my questions.
They're cleaning the beach.
I'll return to Australia on October 20th.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Say something.
Help!
Tom and Mary are constantly fighting.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
Somebody touched me.
Stop complaining.
Bring us two egg sandwiches, two cups of coffee and two pieces of apple pie, please.
I don't want him to think that i hate him.
I grew up in Australia.
I want to start a family.
Tom eats less than Mary.
Mike smiled.
Did you eat your spinach?
I do it because I want to.
You are crazy.
Send me there.
I have to lock this door.
Tom has OCD.
Stay inside.
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
I'm planning to read as many books as I can this year.
Tom wants a dozen eggs.
Is that Tom's father?
And who else?
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Tom is visiting Australia.
They smiled.
Come closer.
I'll be calling you every morning.
Please read that book.
Can you fix this?
Are you lying?
My brothers!
You can change that if you want.
Don't you ever call them?
Be patient.
Try to keep Tom from doing that.
Hang on!
I hope we're not bothering you.
My grandfather has no idea what the Berber language means.
Somebody had to do that.
What a fright I got when I opened the door!
I hope no one saw you come in here.
It is raining.
Who wrote these stories?
Thanks anyway.
Whether I lift it or pose it, it does not stop squeaking; what to do with it, my god?
I didn't lie. You did.
Please remember me to your parents.
Where is your key?
They are very alike to me.
Marie didn't like that game.
Does Tom help you in the kitchen?
You saw yourselves in the mirror.
Nothing's been changed.
Answer him.
Tom makes more money than Mary.
Can you reach it?
Are you Japanese?
Swimming at night is dangerous.
Stop apologizing.
What did he say?
Stop dreaming.
Tom and I weren't friends.
Tom hates it when we do that.
Tom was as proud as a peacock.
Tom wouldn't do that to Mary.
Life is sweet.
Stay calm.
France is my second country.
I can read it.
Please tell Tom to come in.
Is it time you need?
Maybe you'd better come with us.
Sami's girlfriend was a snobby bitch.
I know about them.
Carry this.
You don't have a heart.
We'll wait for you there.
I'm not your slave!
I want to go to see a movie.
Open your eyes.
Are you coming?
Stay away from trouble like these.
Tom moved.
It seems Tom knows that Mary did that.
You're all alone.
Can you fix this?
Is there somebody you want to call?
Just take me home.
I've been bitten by a snake.
Can you swim?
Please continue.
I'm going to ask you something.
Is French easy?
We know.
I want to be able to speak French fluently.
We met a writer.
You can buy and read any kind of book at any time.
Are you scared?
Am I making any sense?
Who responded?
Have you seen him?
Someone stole my watch.
Your son is a nice, fine young man.
I miss it.
Let's try something.
I hope no one saw you doing that.
Somebody has been sleeping on this sofa.
You are not Japanese.
I'm not your slave!
Let go of me.
I know Tom is a teacher.
It must have rained during the night.
He dozed off.
Tom insulted Mary.
Tom liked being with Mary.
"The end of the world is not for tomorrow", said Livy.
Mary is better at this than I am.
I am curious.
Tom knew Mary was following him.
Can you make a salad?
You're all right.
Can I ask a dumb question?
May I have the menu, please?
You talked to them, didn't you?
Somebody caught me by the arm.
I'll give you my car.
Get your carcass out of here!
Sami started telling the story.
Tom is always on my mind.
Are you joking?
What swagger!
Maybe Tom saw something.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Stop complaining.
Tom opened the door and told Mary John wasn't home.
Nothing is happening.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Somebody made a mistake.
I study Latin because it's my favorite language.
Somebody's listening.
Tom looks very happy.
Why are you reading this?
I'm drinking a glass of rosé.
What kind of games do you like?
Can you read that?
Tom went to Boston just last week.
Monday is my busiest day.
Are you stupid?
You are German?
I'll find a way.
Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday.
What time will you eat?
Turn left.
Tom is in Boston, but Mary isn't.
Somebody called the police.
Stay back.
Who cares?
That sounds fair.
Everyone gossips.
Open the door.
I just received your letter.
I don't want to eat leftovers.
Her suitcase is too heavy.
I have something to give you.
What will you drink?
Move over.
Tom is standing up.
I can kill you.
That worked.
They dream.
You are wavering.
They want to become citizens.
Stop them!
Have you read this book yet?
That's your slave, right?
I'll talk about poems.
You see what I mean?
It's the same as before.
Do you think I could do that?
Today is Thursday.
Stop whimpering.
It'll snow today.
His way of thinking is very childish.
Tom lacks motivation.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom craves attention.
Take this medicine every four hours.
I'm really happy to be back in Australia.
Sami knows who that is.
She just wants to have fun.
What a beautiful city!
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
Someone entered the room.
It stopped snowing.
I missed you very much.
I had to tell somebody.
Tom and I are married.
Stop crying.
Try to keep Tom from leaving early.
She likes oranges.
Tom saw somebody.
Could you please wait a minute?
Can I take your picture with us?
This is for you.
Is my answer correct?
Time flew.
Who told you that Tom didn't win?
What'll Tom do tomorrow?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
Are you mocking me?
Coffee, please.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
Tom is very likely to want to go with you.
Come here soon.
Come home.
Play there.
Get a haircut.
Hurry up, Tom.
Was I supposed to ignore Tom?
Are you helping him?
Just talk with them.
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
I don't understand art.
Stay away!
No pain, no gain.
We'd better go.
Help me, please.
Have you become insane?
I slept, and you?
You speak good English.
Why don't you call Tom and remind him?
Sweet dreams!
This is Mary's husband.
Tom is a writer.
Give me a cup of coffee.
I bought a bottle of water.
Mary told Tom she didn't like her job.
What a bad life! What a hard reality!
That store is closed Mondays.
Tom was wide awake.
Do you have any further questions to ask?
You can call me tonight.
Adults only.
You'd better not argue with Tom.
Get Tom.
We talked.
What was in the room?
Tom saw somebody.
I voted for Ken.
Everyone dreams.
Tom broke my heart.
Could someone tell me why Tom is angry?
This is for you.
Mennad has socks.
I finally found a place where we can be alone.
I can kill you.
I apologize.
Snow melts.
Let it as good as it gets.
Tom will always love Mary.
Spring has come.
No one will believe us.
Be courteous.
I hurried home.
Tom wouldn't speak to us.
Someone is calling you.
Your mother eats shit.
Get out, shabby! Why be so envious, you who are so old?
Why don't you eat vegetables?
Tom is a talented actor, isn't he?
That was fabulous.
Say 'ahhh'.
Tom walked past Mary.
Someone stole my money.
Look closely.
How clever Tom is!
You speak tremendously fast.
I'm not used to working outside.
"You have friends, don't you?" "Sure."
Everyone giggled.
She has been busy since yesterday.
Finally, the guests left, and it was quiet in the apartment.
I can kill you.
We'll walk one behind the other, one next to the other, so we'll have our rights.
They're with me.
Where does your grandmother live?
Tom unleashed his dogs.
Tell them that I'm here.
You are an idiot!
Are you generous?
What do you read?
You swim better than me.
Tom killed the rat with his cane.
What's your friend's name?
I answered.
Children love Halloween.
Is French difficult?
Tom said he liked teaching French.
Is there anything we can do?
It needs to be repaired.
You are teachers.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
Its name is Tom.
You are thirsty.
We're having a nice time in Boston.
Yell!
Don't rush things.
Tom gloated.
Chuck Norris was born in the house he built.
I have a slow Internet connection.
The night has just begun.
I'll buy you something to eat.
Ready for take-off.
What time was it when you got here?
You are morons.
Wake up!
Would you pass me the salt, please?
I love you.
Nothing lasts forever. The coffee gets cold. The smoke clears. The time passes and the people change.
You are so smart!
Did you get some sleep?
I don't feel hungry at all.
Was I wrong?
Do you enjoy losing?
Are you crazy?
Tom wanted revenge.
It will rain tonight.
I just got out of school.
I can't agree with you on this matter.
Are they busy?
Who contributed?
Hold still.
Hi, I'm Tom. What's your name?
Do you want to stay any longer?
I plan to stay in Boston until October.
Tom felt great.
Tom didn't care who was watching.
Tom can rest as long as he wants.
Take cover!
Get changed.
You absolutely have to watch it.
Take cover!
I cannot read without glasses.
I don't like swimming in this river.
Do you hear me well now?
I hope no one sees us.
You're not sleeping enough.
We're trying to help you.
You know that Tom likes beer.
I'm glad you were there.
Where are you going today?
You look Japanese.
Tom said that he left his keys at home.
Did you stop Tom?
Nobody is indispensable.
Why did you fire Tom?
Open your mouth!
I'd like to try.
I'm going to show you how it's done.
My positive self-talk creates my reality.
If I were you, I would go home and take a good rest.
I don't want your pity.
Tom doesn't seem to eat much.
They're not suspicious.
You're all racists.
Sami was lost and needed to ask for directions.
You are hilarious.
You're all crazy.
Your parents adore me.
Are you from Kyoto?
Don't swim here.
Are you expecting somebody?
Have you ever played chess with Tom?
I didn't know that you didn't know how to do that.
Only Tom would've known that.
They are unstoppable!
I miss Paris so much.
I'm supposed to be in Australia.
I need to learn to defend myself.
We all hate them.
Have you ever eaten a bat?
He died recently.
What are you doing for Halloween?
Be reasonable.
That's your slave, right?
When did this start happening?
She idolized him.
Let me explain why.
I cannot decide whether to go or not.
Mary knows exactly what she wants.
Try getting a dog, a cat or a chicken.
I know that you're here, Tom.
Matoub Lounès is the symbol of the struggle for freedom and human rights.
I came to see you.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Sami is stranded.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Tom whispered something to Mary.
I love you bunches.
Can I ask a stupid question?
Where's my computer?
I'm not your slave!
Even Tom can understand French.
Follow the example of your sister.
You know I can't.
I've come to talk with you again.
They live in the suburbs.
Food arrived.
Why were you wearing a jacket?
God is.
Somebody's watching you.
Tom put Mary to bed.
How can I get to the train station?
I'll come help you.
You should read this.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Whose is this?
I'll buy you that.
Tom brought his brother.
I will have returned tomorrow.
We've seen them.
Are you wounded?
We'll have to do something.
You speak German extremely well.
Talk to somebody.
Call me if there's any change.
They laughed.
Stop apologizing.
Who cheated?
Tom wrote me from Australia.
Tom shut the door on his finger.
When will you leave?
Why would you want to help me?
I have another solution.
It's work.
Who's speaking?
What pains you, pains me too.
He wants more.
Tom frowned.
No, thank you. I don't drink coffee.
These are my books.
Tom turned around.
Someone's calling.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
No Smoking!
Come over!
I give you plenty of money each month.
We all hate them.
Hurry home.
She helps him.
Loosen up.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
Somebody killed Tom.
Tom isn't likely to go to Boston with Mary.
Tom bought drinks for everybody in the bar.
Why do you want all this stuff?
Tom isn't a good writer.
No one can forgive them.
Tell me about your job.
Find somebody else.
Is he dead?
Who remembers?
Come dance!
Tom was not amused.
Tom misunderstood.
Somebody was murdered.
I like noodles.
Tom wanted advice from Mary.
What are you actually talking about?
Someone took my place.
Sami pulled the bull out of his bag.
Do you remember what Tom said?
You first.
Tom married for money.
What're you thinking?
Tom's brother is a lawyer.
Did you drive when you were in Australia?
Tom didn't mention Mary.
I know that Tom is a journalist.
Are you crazy?
Who canceled?
Your hands are stained with blood.
Is someone there?
The denigration is inexcusable.
Tell him tomorrow.
I heard someone scream.
Who farted?
He used to get up early.
Tell me how can I help you.
Tom's plane is landing right now.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
São Paulo is a big city in Brazil.
What's your dad's name?
No one believes that he is innocent.
I'm looking for somebody.
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat.
Play there.
What the heck are you doing here?
Everyone waited.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
I want to know who called.
Please remember me to your parents.
I don't fear death.
I thank you for your helpfulness.
Don't you know how to fix it?
Even though I continue to graze, I take a look; said the sheep.
My mother has been sick for two days.
Tom is hiding something.
Divide and conquer.
Did I ever tell you about what I did last summer in Boston?
The Central Bank issued a downbeat assessment of the economic prospects for the next financial year.
Mary built it.
Come here.
Hello sir!
Do you own a house in Australia?
You saw yourself in the mirror.
He kissed my neck.
I don't miss Boston at all.
Matoub Lounès is the Kabyle John Lennon.
Don't give Tom what he's asking for.
Someone's calling.
I don't think that Tom would agree to that.
When are you planning to leave?
Are you talking?
I lent her my car.
You're a lie.
I want more money.
Keep looking.
I'm glad to know you.
Somebody set the fire.
Sami made a new friend.
Is someone meeting us?
I can drive.
Can you see?
They voted.
If you eat that, you'll die.
I want someone to talk to.
Somebody is watching us.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I never forgot you.
I want to apologize for everything I said.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Tom, Mary and John were all there.
They run.
Tom plans to be back on October 20th.
I heard someone shouting.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since October.
Tom warned Mary.
Nobody went there.
Both of us were tired.
Can you cut my sandwich in half?
I felt really embarrassed.
The dog is dying.
You are handsome.
Freeze!
I know it takes courage to do that.
You are right.
Did you call him yet?
Good things come to those who wait.
Somebody's watching you.
Have you vomited yet?
Tom came.
Answer my questions.
Someone is calling you.
Tom told me he waited for thirty minutes.
Let's try again.
To a bone that complained that a dog kept nibbling him, he said: Sorry, you are so hard and I do not have anything else to do.
Tom bought it for Mary.
I was ready for them.
I like traveling.
Somebody tried to kill you.
Who said that?
OK, I won't do it again.
This is Tom's idea.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
Heavy industry always benefits from war.
What size are your shoes?
Ramadan Mubarak.
You have only to go there.
Poor girl.
I want to hold your hand.
Go away!
Stop talking.
This is a spoon.
Where is the closest subway station?
I will be back soon.
We never stop learning.
This gift is for you.
Get up!
Sami followed Layla to her building.
Tom's and Mary's parents are friends.
She won!
I don't have any other choice.
They are not coming back.
He walks fast.
I liked this film.
Read this now.
Snow fell in large flakes.
Explain yourself.
Are you OK?
A beer, please.
I believed you.
Who stopped?
Just let me go.
I work for Tom.
You make me feel dizzy!
Sami fought a lot.
I don't want to wait that long.
Somebody set the fire.
Tom has to go to school.
The future will only be good.
Somebody will see us.
No one ate the cake.
I read.
Have you ever worked with her?
He does not want to leave.
Tom said he was unlikely to cry.
Everybody laughs.
Please give me a ring this evening.
Sami and Farid shared the same prison cell.
We did that on October 20th.
Help Tom get up.
Tom knows that he can trust you.
Prices went up.
I wonder if Tom is artistic.
He could speak French.
Take this.
How many do you have?
I'm fairly busy.
Watch me.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
It's dangerous!
Just apologize.
I'll be in Australia till October 20th.
Will you go to Copacabana today?
Please.
I saw Tom sitting at his desk, reading a book.
Tell them that I'm here.
My new dress is red.
It is not our responsibility.
Lead the way.
You boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Jim resembles his father.
Franz Kafka said, in "The Lost Time" (or perhaps, orally, Woody Allen): "Eternity is long ... especially around the end."
What a fright I got when I opened the door!
A cup of tea, please.
I'll give you a call before I come.
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
Tom is likely to do that, isn't he?
Leave it up to us.
Tom should've been fired last October.
What is your father's name?
Sami saw it again.
I want to sit in the middle.
Tom is a talented actor, isn't he?
I'm not tall.
You should be careful in crossing the street.
Say that again.
This is a good day.
At the start my father didn't care.
Can I ask a stupid question?
Exercise is good for you.
I'll tell you how to do it.
You saw that movie, didn't you?
World peace.
I need someone to help me do this.
Never!
Tom will go to Boston next month.
Have you ever been in New York?
That won't happen.
Tom said that I can't come in.
Would you like white wine or red?
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
Can you stop yelling?
Are you home?
Don't talk behind my back.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Taste this.
Containment is long.
I've wronged you.
Eat everything you wish.
Tom disappeared.
I was in Boston when that happened.
Have you read this?
You're after Tom.
It looks like snow.
Make it happen.
I think I'd like to do that.
You and I love games.
I wanted to marry Tom.
Men like to eat.
I haven't been there since October.
How did you find me?
A Mr Jones has come to see you.
I like learning languages.
Everybody pronounces Tom's name wrong.
She lied.
I think you did that intentionally.
Can you pass me the salt, please?
It's Monday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were all born on October 20, 2013.
Sami ransacked Layla's house.
You too.
Talk to somebody.
Sami has been there for five or six months.
Are you crazy?
I ate lunch with Tom.
Someone broke my camera.
Guess again.
Put your room in order.
They always mock others.
Tom came to trust Mary.
It's dead.
They never said anything about that.
Tom and Mary hoped that no one had seen them.
"Tom said he..." "I don't care what Tom said."
You are early.
Do you come back from Tibet?
I knew Tom wasn't dead.
Tom wants to buy some books.
You are talking.
What about?
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
I was reading a book.
Tell me that you've forgiven me.
I want you to come at once.
Dry your eyes.
Rima is a student.
How do you vent your anger?
I thank you for your gift.
I saw someone.
Why are you reading that?
We're talking about Tom.
Can I have it?
There is not much hope.
I know it takes courage to do that.
Anza is the moaning that some people hear at night, in houses where people have been slaughtered or have suffered a violent death.
Maybe Tom knows something.
I drink coffee with milk.
I hope no one saw you.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
I know you came to Boston in October.
I am getting dressed.
Why hasn't he texted me back?
I love you very much.
Are you sure that you know what to do?
Tom understands French.
Tom is still crying.
Can you come?
There's somebody there.
How many pounds have you gained?
How stupid he is!
Please stop it.
Red wine, please.
The lion said "The flies know that I'm in trouble!"
Somebody's made a mistake.
Tom hasn't left Australia.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
Tom left about an hour ago with Mary.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
Talk!
Tom understood.
When will you come?
The milk tastes sour.
Terrific!
Tom went to Boston to look for a job.
You should help your father.
Two years is a long time to wait.
I'm glad to see you, too.
Why is Tom blaming us?
Have Tom and Mary taught French?
Why do you hate dogs so much?
Follow me!
I studied French.
Will these wounds heal?
You won.
Faster!
Immediately!
Please, where are you from?
What do you feed your dog?
The charming Isabelle Adjani is Kabyle.
Tom is well known in Australia.
I was hoping Tom wouldn't tell me to do that.
Which one would you like?
Look here.
Tom met many other artists when he was in Boston.
Tom washed the car this morning.
I went to the Halloween party as a vampire.
He stood there for a while.
Leave Tom alone.
Tom wanted to call Mary.
I can't see her.
I see life differently now.
I see a book.
Have you read this?
I misunderstood.
Wait right here.
I don't have a younger sister.
Tom and Mary explained why they were there.
You are two-faced.
I study art history.
Dream on!
Maybe we should tell somebody.
Little did he realize the danger he was facing.
I will write to you as soon as I can.
I shaved.
We know you lied to Tom.
You will regret this.
Good.
How many states does India have?
Tom can't find Mary.
Tom writes slowly.
You make me feel dizzy!
Tom kissed me.
Did somebody say something?
Believe me!
You are impolite.
Can you help me translate that into French?
I want to travel with you.
We walked together as far as the next station.
Sami called his mother.
Somebody wants to kill me.
Tom began threatening Mary.
Someone stole my wallet.
Did he say anything about it to you?
Can you help me translate that into French?
Tom is standing up.
I'll go swimming with you.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Please get in.
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
Tom sent you something.
We apologize.
I've decided I'll do that instead.
I was studying French when you called yesterday.
Get outside right now.
She reads.
You don't look that busy.
He touched me so much.
The internet is not connecting.
Follow that car.
You may enter.
Tom helped.
Let go of me.
Somebody has died.
Are you that stupid?
Give it to me.
I have to talk to somebody.
I have something to give you.
Somebody poisoned them.
Understand?
Tom fainted.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
Your letter made me happy.
I'm going to show you how it's done.
If you want to leave, then leave now!
Thank you, I finally understand.
Tom is fat.
You are not Japanese.
If old age could, if youth knew.
Stop singing.
Don't wait.
Comfort him.
Choose any flowers you like.
Save me.
One day, somebody will succeed.
Did you call?
Are you new?
If Mary had been here, she'd have helped us.
Talk.
Where the hell did I put them?
Have a nice day!
Tom doesn't look very happy.
Are you stuck?
I can do what I want.
I can't protect you.
Sami's friend passed away.
Why did you buy it?
Please pass me the sugar.
The milk tastes sour.
We were waiting for them.
We've written to them.
Keep going.
I need somebody to talk to.
You walk quickly!
We caught three foxes.
He is afraid of him.
Tom swore to Mary that he wasn't the one who stole her necklace.
I missed you very much.
Tom has never told Mary he was sorry.
Don't talk!
Tom was in seventh heaven.
They did things to me.
You ought not to have spent so much money on that.
Repeat!
Where is the cafeteria?
I'll talk to them about it.
Tom knew that Mary was following him.
Look alive.
This isn't Australia.
We haven't yet found a good solution.
I did not see anything.
I regret that I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Yes, please.
He went.
Continue working.
You betrayed your country.
Sami drank Layla's urine.
Are you angry?
I have to talk to somebody.
They were eating.
Tom wasn't doing anything.
Nobody slept.
Follow my advice.
Everybody sang.
What else do you need to buy?
I'm no friend of yours.
I suspect Tom is ready.
Get some rest.
Tom does love you.
They want you dead.
I'm a Muslim and I believe in Jesus. What's wrong?
Always have your dictionary near at hand.
You wanted to speak to me, didn't you?
Have courage.
I can run.
I know whose book this is.
There are some notebooks on the table.
Have you made up your mind what you're going to give Tom for his birthday?
You look beautiful.
He walks fast.
No questions?
I told them not to tell you.
It smells bad.
Follow the example of your sister.
I'm very choosy.
Stop staring.
Tom's room is always neat.
Keep singing.
You make me feel dizzy!
I'll be in Australia until October 20th.
Listen to this!
We can work on that right now.
Get ready quickly.
I have to eat now.
I am not breaking anything.
Tom gave me some books.
I'm sorry that you lost.
It's windy.
Examine them.
Somebody's watching you.
It is a pity you cannot come.
Consider it.
Tom lent Mary 300 dollars.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left there the day before yesterday.
Tom says he's never heard Mary sing.
Nothing changed.
Let him lead his life as he pleases.
Please lend me your car.
I did do that.
Answer as soon as possible!
How did they find out about Tom?
My uncle calls on me every three days.
Tom didn't kiss Mary.
Try to keep him occupied.
Do we really have to go back?
Watch the road.
Another lonely day.
Tom should've bought flowers for Mary.
Tom followed Mary into the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20th.
Tom won't let you go.
There is a limit to everything.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why weren't you listening to me?
I bought a used car.
It hurts!
Nobody understands me.
Forget Tom.
Are you artistic?
Are you circumcised?
Tom coughed.
Tom snapped out of his reverie.
Nothing is happening.
Go where nobody knows you.
I don't like big dogs.
Is there somebody you want to see?
I don't use a computer every day.
Tom can cook.
Play!
I aim to be a writer.
Skip it.
Tom tried to resuscitate Mary.
Tom is impolite.
You'd better not eat too much.
I'm Kabyle.
Somebody was in the house.
I'm not a student.
Tom said that he would stop smoking.
Somebody just called.
Tom didn't see it.
What are you waiting for?
I need somebody to help me do this.
Tom is divorced.
Modesty is a virtue.
I love to watch westerns.
I can't see well.
He will come to you tomorrow.
Tom got lost.
Are you in Australia?
I hope no one followed you.
Have you no shame?
Who? Me?
Forget it!
Tom always speaks French with me.
I've got a report to write.
I know some of the boys.
Is it OK if I take a break?
He was surprised to see her.
I can't agree with you on this matter.
Say cheese.
I'm buying.
Tom attempted to swim across the river.
Are you funny?
Come home.
You have to encourage him to become a teacher!
Why were you fired?
What do we call you?
I do need to do that today.
All my problems are over.
I sent her home.
I love her.
I heard someone whistle.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
Where is Ouagadougou located?
Someone is watching you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Did you warn Tom?
How are you?
Why don't you call Tom and remind him?
Somebody was talking to Tom.
Please tell Tom to come in.
Everyone loves you.
Can I ask a dumb question?
According to science, humans evolved from monkeys.
Tom wasn't a credible witness.
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
Tom was recommended by Mary.
Do something!
The books they gave me as a gift are great.
We went for a swim in the river.
I think it's good for you to read this book.
Why were you frightened?
These are new.
Somebody help me.
Somebody is watching us.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Tom hasn't died yet.
That way we kill two birds with one stone.
Someone called Tom.
Whose is this bag?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me roses.
Tom became nervous.
Give me a different one.
She disappeared.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to Australia?
You are talking.
Did they check them?
I took a walk with my dog.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
Young people of nowdays are smart.
Please don't be angry at me.
Someone is calling you.
He does not know what to do now.
Do you have any questions?
Yell!
Please step aside.
Oh, hush!
What's the fuss all about?
I would have understood.
Don't eat that.
What do you feed your dog?
Tom has until October 20th to decide.
I was fired.
Take me home.
You have to see this film.
You're all insane.
She is beautiful.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How's everybody?
She grew roses.
You should've done that with us.
Eat your soup, John!
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
You, I think you just want to klash me a cable.
I left Australia on October twentieth.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Someone stole my money.
I know that Tom is very busy.
They're asleep.
What can you give us, Tom?
I still remember doing that.
I thought he would come.
No one here can swim.
I'm taking care of it.
Drink water.
Can somebody help?
Listen up.
This is my son, everything else is destiny.
I wonder whether Tom has a rope ladder or not.
By the way, Tom still wants to go out with you.
Tom said that he isn't going to sing.
I like it very much.
Thank you for decorating my house.
I wonder what it would be like to be rich.
Add me more of work as long as I'm enthusiastic.
How do you find his new novel?
Somebody might stop me.
Are you Russian?
Tom says he's never eaten Thai food.
Tom said he had the day off.
Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher.
Can you swim?
You're all crazy.
When did Tom come?
What did you put into the box?
He became famous.
I called security.
You danced.
Tom bumped into Mary.
That house is very small.
We're not ready to order yet.
Away with you!
Whose idea was it?
I've already fed the dog.
Have some coffee.
I hope you understand.
How did you find me?
I think that'll settle it.
"What will happen to our Kabyle language?" "It will stay forever!"
She assembles computers.
I have nothing to fear.
I won't try and stop you.
I want to know about everything you've done.
Did something happen?
I feel something.
Have you got a dog?
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Seize him!
Are you there?
Tom lies.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia now.
Suddenly, they appeared to me.
Tom said that he isn't alone.
This water tastes good.
Thanks!
Someone is waiting for Tom.
I like candlelight.
Do you like Italian?
Did you find your letters?
I don't love you anymore.
I saw a dog.
What's this fruit called?
What's my prize?
I won't forget this.
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
Sorry...
When did you start doing this?
I resign.
Done.
Tom said I needed to study French.
He couldn't finish his dinner.
Back off!
Tom told me Mary wasn't thirsty.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
I can't take it any more.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
A cup of tea, please.
Do you write in French?
Call me if there's any change.
Away with you!
Have you seen Tom yet?
They'll be playing soccer tomorrow.
Hey, John.
How strong you are!
Tom exercised.
Go ahead.
Suddenly, something unexpected happened.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Monday comes after Sunday.
Will you be in Boston in October?
Do you see the smile?
Is she going to remember me?
You were right.
You speak tremendously fast.
Hungry?
Did anybody come?
Come here.
Djafar was drunk yesterday.
I'm stuck in my job.
Tom loves art.
Someone is watching.
You never told me you knew Tom.
Monday comes after Sunday.
I'm not your slave!
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
What is your Skype display name?
Somebody has broken this dish.
Play!
Pace yourself.
It doesn't cost much to eat at that restaurant.
I almost drowned.
I hate losing.
Forget him.
You are ill.
You should write a novel.
No pain, no gain.
Understood.
Who went with you?
Birds of a feather flock together.
Fix this.
Help me!
You had better have your hair cut.
Tom bought cocaine from Mary.
We referred to divorce.
Are you sure that you know what to do?
I'm staying in Australia now.
Tom went home with Mary.
The seat of my pants is torn.
You lie.
Tom and Mary are coming right back.
I either like you a lot or I just simply love you.
Snow completely covered the town.
Give me all this money.
We found him alive.
Where are you?
The one for whom I gave myself so much harm, now he wants to make me blind.
Somebody wants to send a message.
Did you see her face?
I'd like you to participate.
You'll find somebody.
You are morons.
I was ready for them.
Do you blame Tom?
You can drive if you want.
They're joking.
Read!
You found me awake.
Somebody should do something.
I feel like eating something.
Tom used to drink beer.
It smells bad.
Did you eat something last night?
Don't leave your stuff here.
Tom needs somebody to help him.
You returned.
Tom said he's never eaten sushi.
Somebody's singing.
Will she come?
Somebody might stop us.
You are fired.
I'll teach Esperanto in my country.
Someone might see us.
I don't miss Boston at all.
Are these books yours or mine?
Tom had no idea that Mary liked him.
That's what you need.
Bring me my glasses.
Go away!
Take these.
Tom just texted me.
Choose carefully.
You may go home now.
Follow me!
I forgot to feed my dog.
You're a disaster in the kitchen.
How awful!
I live in Yerevan.
No things here.
I'm sure you'll find a way to do it.
Tom can swim.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
They approve.
Stop crying.
Someone is watching Tom.
Get dressed.
My hand itches.
Do you go swimming in the winter?
Tom will never forget Mary.
Please remember me to all your family.
You are lying.
They applauded.
Tom misses Mary.
They were dead.
You may read this book.
I asked him to come with me and he agreed.
Are you afraid?
I allowed Tom to kiss me.
Let it slide.
Are you American?
You have no idea what true love is.
They're mocking you.
Walk slowly.
Wake up!
Tom plays the guitar.
Buying an apartment is both exciting and scary.
Somebody's listening.
Have you seen the new movie?
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
Stand aside.
Are the fingers yours?
What if someone catches us?
That's all she wrote.
Are you lying?
Tom is thinking.
Reading improves the mind.
Perhaps you should stop.
Have you ever been in New York?
Tom said Mary seemed scared.
You found us awake.
Do you think we'll have good weather?
Bring help.
Can't anything be done?
Tom isn't as good-looking as his brother.
Look behind you.
Open the wardrobe by this key.
I did not leave her alone.
What is a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
Is it popular?
Did you know Mary before she joined the team?
Identify yourself.
Somebody has broken this dish.
Nobody went there.
Tom and I are just friends.
Are you lying to me?
The book cannot read itself.
Please teach me how to swear in French.
I've already told Tom I don't want to do that.
Tom and I'll always be friends.
Is that French?
She prayed.
How beautiful!
Do you want to get some food?
I do like you.
Stop sniffling.
Try to keep him occupied.
There's one for you and one for me.
Tom has told me so much about you.
I am tired of reading.
How many books did you read?
That's the story.
Tom hesitated.
How long?
Somebody's singing.
Open your mouth!
How did you enjoy your time in Boston?
Where did you abandon them?
Turn the TV off.
Do you want food?
Make yourself at home.
Tom couldn't remember where he hid the map.
Control yourselves.
Silence reigned in the forest.
I can eat whenever I want to.
Tom and I were born on the same day.
Mr Tanaka called during your absence.
Are your parents still alive?
I just can't sleep.
Hurry up.
Everyone giggled.
We speak.
Tom contacted Mary.
I made a bad mistake.
Tom was sitting beside Mary.
Tell us a ghost story.
He knows ten languages.
Sami didn't play this game.
Tom has built a large house.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I've always been proud of you.
I can't speak another language.
Tom has never had a problem with anybody.
Hi everyone.
Tom is unaware that Mary did that.
He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom got nervous.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Why weren't you paying attention?
Everyone in the class made fun of Tom's new haircut.
Sami didn't know how to socialize.
Call me when you get there.
Why didn't Tom ask someone else to do that?
We have a lot of food.
Snow year, corn year
Tom's changed.
Tom's face was pale.
You still don't understand.
Know thyself!
Someday, soon.
Days of the holidays.
Your cake is delicious.
How's your weekend going so far?
Have another.
Tom saw Mary at the Halloween party.
Get real.
I'd like to see your sister.
Tom bought it for Mary.
Tom passed away on October 20, 2013.
Tom scares me.
Tom has departed for Australia.
You can give me some money?
You're a talented writer.
They're empty.
Julia sings.
What confusion!
Is anybody here?
Sami was stranded in a small town.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
Somebody saw you.
You're very different from us.
Love me!
Step back.
Those who reject criticism will not develop.
A Mr Sakaki has come to see you.
Tom started reading.
Something wrong?
Tom disagreed.
Do you watch TV every day?
I like joking.
Slowly, please.
Can you come?
I will do all I can for you.
We might have wished all people to take care of their onions, their religion, their intimate convictions, without bothering their neighbor, who may not want it. Let those who want to practice do so soberly. But if someone prevents you from chewing your own gum, then let him steam his couscous alone.
I read the book.
I need you to do something.
Are you going to leave me?
Tom says he has to borrow some money.
Book now.
Tom told me I was pretty.
You are home.
You fainted.
Then who?
Could I have some coffee, please?
Please reply.
The hall contains 5,000 people.
Fallen rocks blocked the way.
Tom's father walked out on his family.
Did someone contact you?
It's windy today, isn't it?
I don't want to wait that long.
How lucky to meet you here.
Tom won't go to Boston until October.
Have you vomited yet?
Have you lost your reason?
I've already told Tom that he should do that.
May I say something?
We may need them.
What is the truth?
Someone's calling.
Are you making him a sandwich?
What program are you watching?
Won't somebody help me?
I gave him what little money I had with me.
Save me!
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
The goat is the poor man's cow.
Do you like Italian?
It is nice to see you again.
Walk.
Look again.
One nail drives out another, as say the elders.
The house caught fire.
I told Tom why I wasn't there.
Tom glanced at Mary.
Today's October twentieth.
Tom said he could help us do that.
Which one would you like?
When did you go to Boston?
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
I came by myself.
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
Are they new?
You alone are my hope.
Freeze!
Defend yourselves.
Tom said that Mary wasn't very surprised.
French bread is delicious.
I never needed that much money.
They waited.
You should be talking to Tom.
Tom came back to the garden and looked around.
Tom phoned to say he isn't coming.
I have to talk to somebody.
Are you joking?
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Are you Russian?
I'm coming back to Boston in October.
You are taller than I.
I feel happy.
When did she take her car?
Fix this.
Tom passed out.
What's your friend's name?
How did Tom go to Australia?
With whom did you see the movie "The Thing"?
Tom and I were on the same train.
I like my Kabyle language.
Is anybody here?
Can you also speak French?
You run.
Tom is a talented writer.
Tom plays the piano every day.
Tom need not go to school today.
That's because you're a girl.
Someone was here.
Sicily is an island.
People change.
I don't want to leave you.
Could you sign this?
You can use this dictionary.
I love coffee.
Tom likes playing tennis, but Mary doesn't.
Tom escaped to Australia.
Tom is a hunk.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Come dance!
I'm afraid we must go if we want to get home before dark.
They're still following us.
Be careful.
We've all missed you.
You may go home now.
Thank God.
This is my opinion, not yours.
I'm going to get you out of here.
Everybody knows where Australia is.
Anger empties the soul of all its resources, so that at bottom the light appears.
Someone's eating.
I thought somebody died.
What is carnelian?
Nobody ever listens.
Who yelled?
Tom described Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom struggled.
He promised me to come early.
You are an idiot!
It already has taken me hours.
It will be too late.
Stop staring.
You just sit there and wait until Tom gets back.
Tom is truthful.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
One never knows whom one might run into.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Show me your papers!
How many days did you stay in Boston?
Someone's outside.
I don't think I'd like Boston.
My doctor is very kind.
I told Tom why I'd been in the hospital.
Get a haircut.
I like turtle-doves.
Someone is watching.
I am happy to see you again.
Naomi shifted her bag from one hand to the other.
You were approaching.
I'm friends with her brother.
Tom won't help Mary.
Why did you come to me?
Hi, everybody.
I'm not special.
Is that your book?
We are happy.
They lied.
Tom is quiet.
They still have bread. Do you want some?
Where I took faggots, you could only take twigs.
Tom's hearing is set for October 20th.
Farmers sow seeds in the spring.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
Follow that car.
Jill saw the movie with Ken.
You heard her, didn't you?
Quit making fun of me.
Has anything changed?
I'm going to go out and get us something to eat.
Can art change the world?
Tom felt tired.
Tom groomed his horse.
They took baskets and went straight to the market.
I'll never forget the day I met Tom.
I play the piano.
What do you want to know about my job?
You're all alone.
I hear somebody talking.
Please put a lot of cream in my coffee.
He believes everything that I say.
She wants him.
When are you going to eat?
Are you married?
I think that I'm just exhausted.
You're a very good student.
Read it again, please.
Tom bought drinks for everybody in the bar.
Hello, Honey.
Please get in.
Did you see my sister?
Did anyone tell her?
I want someone to talk to.
Why are you telling me this nonsense.
Red is better.
If you want your money back, you can have it.
You are very brave.
Do not run two hares at the same time.
When I moved to Boston, I was still in my thirties.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
Fix this.
Go ahead, tell me.
I vowed I'd never go back there.
What do you think is missing?
Somebody else might get hurt.
Sami changed his address.
We need somebody.
I didn't lie. You did.
The book is too expensive.
Where's your son?
Tom is slated to return in October.
Tom was rescued by Mary.
Tom needs someone to help him.
Do you see a queen?
This book doesn't belong to Tom.
I don't know whom you want to see.
Follow your dreams.
Tom spoke with Mary last night.
Perhaps there are other reasons.
Somebody stole my lunch.
Let me be.
Everybody agrees.
Toughen up!
Look at my new car.
It's still warm.
My son went to Japan.
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French?
Are you really going to give this to Tom?
They always mock others.
Where's your God now?
Sami started to really freak out.
Tom enjoys reading.
Home!
Tom scolded Mary.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia now.
He called his sister.
God knows.
We speak.
Are you Tom?
Nobody gets you.
Tom loves singing.
I wish that somebody would do that.
Tom probably could help you on Monday.
The dog is sleeping.
You should exercise.
All my friends have one.
Anyway, the bat that is believed to be the source of the CoVid19 virus will have flabbergasted us, since no one expected it.
We bought this in Australia.
Get outside right now.
Watch the road.
You told them a story.
You can talk, can't you?
Do you know a certain Mr. Green?
Live!
Tom bought something for Mary.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Did you read this?
You found them awake.
Give me a call tomorrow.
A sticky bird cannot fly.
Wait for him.
Choose carefully.
Is it white?
Does God really command Muslims to kill non-Muslims?
Give it to whomever you like.
Maybe Tom saw something.
Who ran?
Tom looks terrified.
Tom lied.
Where were you this morning?
Can you see?
Lidia, can you cook some food to Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
Tom killed someone.
I didn't lie. You did.
Did you get some sleep?
I like art.
I'm not your love.
Be cool.
I will introduce you to some friends who study German.
You must look to your manners.
I really appreciate your coming.
Everybody spoke French.
Know thyself!
My garden is small.
He found them awake.
This is not quite enough.
You're after Tom.
Ignore him.
Peter is buying a female cat.
What were you telling him?
Do you come back from Tibet?
What did you tell Tom?
Tom wore his Halloween costume to school.
Everyone's dead.
Are you expecting someone?
Someone is watching.
A women said: " let me go jungle and I'll leave you my cover".
This lion was born in captivity.
Tom starts work October 20th.
We were waiting for them.
Don't tell anyone.
You speak.
Somebody set the fire.
Open your books!
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
Tom knows that Mary went to Boston.
Get dressed.
Nothing was out of place.
The jar is empty.
Come tomorrow.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
I think Tom doesn't speak French very often.
Control yourself.
Go early in order to get a good seat.
What did you wear?
Somebody has done that already.
Do it now.
Did you eat lunch?
Do you remember what Tom said?
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
I am not breaking anything.
You are taller than she.
Thanks for your encouragement.
Knowing how to conjugate verbs is an absolute necessity.
Live!
Who listened?
Tom and Mary aren't planning to stay together.
Someone stole my money.
I'm surprised to see you.
She helped him.
Tom relaxed.
Stay with me.
Please respond.
Every morning I ask myself why.
Well, I'm just watching TV...
Somebody has to do something.
Have you got through with your work?
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
She lied.
He has a lot of problems in mind.
I am neither the right wing nor the left one. I am the bird.
She already knew the answer.
What do you like? What don't you like?
Who are you?
Where should we go? What do you suggest?
Where's your grandson?
Tom will follow Mary.
Finally!
Let's try and find a cure.
Let me be.
Tom is already on the bus.
You don't look that busy.
May I go home now?
Tom nodded.
When will you come to Algeria?
I heard him rambling, the words entirely disconnected.
You lie.
Tom will never believe me again.
What is considered impolite in one language may not be considered impolite in another language.
Did somebody get hurt?
Snow is falling.
I enjoy eating out.
Someone stole my passport.
Tom is back.
We found Mary.
Whose book is this?
Latvian is a beautiful language that naturally gives off music.
Is this Tom's car?
Tom thought about Mary a lot.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
Tofu goes well with sake.
Why would you ever think so?
Tom introduced Mary into the Church of Satan.
Tom kneeled.
She might come.
How to love a girl from whom we can not see anything?
She drew water from the well.
Do you find me pretty?
Somebody stole my lunch.
Sami sat in the middle seat.
Tom and I are separated.
Have courage!
I'd rather be by myself.
I'm not washing your car.
She had always found him handsome.
You can change that if you want.
Stop lying to me.
Is Muhammad a true prophet or not?
Who is there?
Have you become insane?
Tom's happiness was short-lived.
Tom missed the whole thing.
Water, please.
I need somebody to talk to.
Tom is good at talking to people.
I was just teasing him.
I don't like playing baseball.
Tom resigned on October 20th.
They have enough money.
Tell everybody.
Do you have any pain?
Tom dies.
Tom was seen on October 20th in Boston.
Tom is vicious.
I am happy to see you again.
Stop whimpering.
You and I love games.
I felt cheated.
She admired him.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I can teach you how to cook.
Where do you intend to eat?
Tom has to tell somebody.
Tom is my best friend.
It was snowing.
Mary was gorgeous.
Alice sleeps in her room.
Tom called.
Start!
Does this dress look okay?
Smile.
There you are.
Is there somebody else here?
Tom cheated Mary.
Please call him.
Sami and Layla argued every day.
Would you like something to read?
I opened the door for Tom.
Is there somebody you want to call?
Tom is wearing a Halloween mask.
I expected it a bit.
I need to learn how to defend myself.
We all know how to speak French.
He plays the guitar well.
Do you want your wife to speak Esperanto?
He was married to her sister.
Somebody is following us.
There's always somebody there.
Can you reach it?
I left you a couple messages.
Who owns this truck?
Today I am here, tomorrow maybe not.
You can't drive.
Somebody is lying here.
You already paid.
Australia is just one of the countries I visited last year.
It was really odd.
Tom sent you something.
Did you want something?
Show me your papers!
Go get changed.
Is it October already?
You are an idiot!
We are brothers.
Be tolerant.
Can somebody open the door, please?
I live in Azerbaijan.
What have you done today?
Are you crazy?
I am crazy about you.
My uncle calls on me every three days.
This book is heavy.
Do you find me pretty?
Are you dead?
Tom said we should wait here.
Leave it up to us.
He was disappointed at not being invited.
I really appreciate your coming.
Tom walked over to Mary.
Choose one.
Your moment has arrived!
She is talking.
Are you Canadian?
It's no joke! Do you think that they will lay down their guns? You should forget about it!
Mary helped Tom.
You are unbeatable!
Some plants are quickly affected by cold.
I seldom sing.
I spent the day on the beach.
You can have any you want.
She came!
Obey your teachers.
Tom is a well-respected man.
Each one keeps his belief for himself.
I know Tom's secret.
Are you polite?
Art is dead.
Aren't you friends with Tom?
He smiled.
This is for you.
Are you human?
Are you content?
I called for help.
You love dancing.
Tom trusts Mary.
Marvellous.
The ramblings are incoherent words from someone who is sick or depressed, that he mumbles while awake.
I think so.
You'd be amazed how much beer Tom drinks when he goes out.
Are you expecting somebody?
Are you angry?
Please think no more about it.
Tom looks busy this morning.
Follow me.
Hang in there, Tom. You're doing fine.
I want you to try this.
Somebody stole it from me.
Do you intend to eat all that?
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Sami bullied her again.
Watch carefully.
Are you going to go swimming?
Somebody stole my lunch.
Forget her.
Are you going to sell Tom your house?
I love games.
I don't want to tell Tom about what happened.
Check that.
Tom emigrated to Australia.
Tom's answer surprised Mary.
She knows the truth.
I don't recognize it.
That's of no use to me.
Tom was jealous of Mary.
Does the soup taste good?
He's going to kill me.
Nobody sent me a letter.
I've got a good idea.
I can't protect you.
Have they arrived yet?
Who went with you?
Tom wanted to make a lot of money quickly.
Nothing changed.
I have to meet with Tom.
Please wait.
I'll take Tom's place.
Is that paper?
I am at home.
You may as well go home now.
Where are your sisters?
I didn't actually do what Tom said I did.
The connexion is miserable today!
They paid separately.
Read it again.
Somebody's going to pay.
Keep writing.
I don't want your pity.
Have the children eaten yet?
He cried.
Why do you need a knife?
Tom currently lives in Australia.
I'm a nurse.
It's windy.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Tom slept.
How can you be proud of a man like that?
That's where I made lots of bundles you picked up only twigs.
Tom cheered.
Are fireworks legal in Australia?
Somebody's going to pay.
Tom had forgotten how beautiful she was.
We need to find somebody who can help us.
He came by the freeway.
He's tired.
She loves to fish.
Someone is watching Tom.
I don't want to grow up.
Both of us were tired.
Spring is here.
Is there somebody you want to see?
Tom took Mary's car keys away because she was drunk.
You can't drink here.
Be careful, there's a car!
Sami and Layla were together for years.
Then she kissed him.
I agreed.
His idea is superior to yours.
Stand up.
I hate computers.
Tom handed a cup of coffee to Mary.
It was their idea.
They greeted Sophia.
Have you finished?
She stopped it.
Where's the rope?
Help us.
Sami didn't even look at me.
We have a visitor.
Kick! Kick!
Where did Tom study French?
He was sitting and reading a book.
Someone's eating.
Can you give me a minute with Tom?
Layla was dating a bad boy.
You can't demonstrate anything.
Mary came in.
Stop complaining.
Tom couldn't handle the problem by himself.
Sami doesn't know who Layla is.
How many books do you have?
You are an idiot!
Nothing is happening.
He accelerated.
Keep reading.
He has gone to Spain.
We ordered 40 minutes ago.
Where's your son?
Tom complained.
They didn't say anything.
Somebody's in trouble.
Quiet, please.
You should eat something.
This one is a real simpleton, for sure. And he's a president.
I read books.
Forget Tom.
You're older than Tom.
I ate him.
Come home.
Ask Alex.
I like swimming.
Protect me!
I'll never overlook your mistakes again.
Tom walked out with Mary.
How much are you willing to pay for it?
Why were you frightened?
Ready for take-off.
Tom is exactly the same age as Mary.
Come into my room.
I should do that now.
Let it flow.
It's spring.
Their contract expired on October 20th.
Did she check him?
Daddy, buy me a vuvuzela!
Help us.
I'm surprised to see you.
Keep moving.
Does Australia have four seasons?
I don't think that that was Tom.
Tom is over his cold.
He is old.
I left Australia on October 20th.
Did you eat your spinach?
I see how you are studying.
Tom is scared of his father.
Leave me alone!
Hello, I am Nancy.
I screamed.
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
I'm going to take tomorrow off.
Everybody pronounces Tom's name wrong.
Choose!
I don't often get to Boston in October.
Sami wasn't going to stop.
You are afraid.
You're a problem.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
Did someone say something?
Someone is calling you.
I need someone to help me.
Be patient lady, he will not be long to arrive.
Are you Chinese?
The two met in October in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, was singing a Kabyle love song in Kabylia.
Did you put everything in there?
Somebody had to do that.
Latin is a dead language.
Only Tom would've known that.
You are welcome.
How are you feeling?
You look sick.
Of course, I'll do that.
Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
No way.
You wanted to speak to me, didn't you?
I have money.
I love her and she loves me.
Sami and Layla ended up going to prom together.
Love is making you blind.
How lucky you are!
We know.
I know her.
Tom was abducted.
A black cat is eating a white mouse.
I'll go.
Get dressed.
Someone screamed.
She bought a bottle of water.
They called.
Let's ask her something else.
Have you lost your reason?
Which is your favorite team?
Follow the example of your sister.
It's close to my home.
You still don't understand.
Dinner!
I asked Tom to leave right away.
Tom couldn't reach Mary.
Can you please show me the photo?
Sami kept the gun there for his protection.
Are you lying to me?
Is she Japanese?
Did you see something?
I need you here tomorrow.
Mary is expecting.
Tom looks sad.
Tom shrugged.
God is.
Tom came back from Australia.
Ignore Tom.
We talked about Australia.
Tom says he can't eat any more.
He is not a boy.
Somebody has done that already.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak a little French.
Tom told Mary that he was thirsty.
I've been to many Asian countries.
My garden is small.
I'm dying for you.
Your job hangs by a thread.
Hit Tom.
Your job hangs by a thread.
On Uber.
These books aren't Tom's.
I want to eat with you.
Get some rest.
Give it to whomever you like.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
What did your mom say?
Tom has a Canadian wife.
I'm going to eat a banana.
You are not funny.
Tom wants to marry me.
I did not sleep until sunrise.
Tom thought that the amulet would one day protect him from witches.
She knows how to live.
I was very concerned in October.
Can you please help me?
Come quickly.
Sami is a very mean person.
The teacher went through my purse.
I want that book, please.
I love jokes.
I'm a human.
Our time has come!
Can that happen in Australia?
Contact Tom.
October is still three months away.
You are happy.
It was a tragedy.
Don't mess with me, Tom.
I'm not the type that surrenders so easily.
I was at your wedding.
What if somebody saw this?
He who seeks will find.
There was nothing you could've done to help.
Sami knows his limits.
Just let me see it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
It looks fine.
I'm not your slave!
Did you drink a lot?
Someone came.
A word can touch or be just seized on the fly.
Are you still in school?
You're part of the problem.
Somebody wanted to scare you.
We will deal with this problem in Chapter Three.
My name is Jack.
Call us.
Tom almost wasn't able to escape.
Tom wanted to make a lot of money quickly.
Roads are blocked.
I'd better tell her.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
The very sick baby was under careful observation by the doctors.
What a horrible event!
I like writing books in my own language.
I hate working.
Keep it.
Save yourself.
No one's going to find him.
Don't you have to work tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics.
Please hurry.
I want to know about everything you've done.
Help me clean out the garage.
Do you see your table?
Tom said that he'll come tomorrow.
I envy you your success.
I'll see you in October.
It turns out that I have a brother.
I'll leave this place trying not to knock anything down.
Calm down.
I forgot your number.
Are you sleeping?
I'm starting a new life.
I was just thinking about you.
I love to eat pizza.
If you can move mountains, you can move molehills.
Tom was speaking to Mary.
Nobody knows why.
We've just finished eating.
Are you worried?
Don't leave!
Straighten up.
Somebody is lying here.
Tom would have understood.
We only did it once.
I know French.
You've got a fever.
Does that make you happy?
You need not have such fear.
Someone is calling you.
I want to impress everyone.
Was the umbrella you found Tom's?
Close your book.
See you later, Mother.
Tom said that he had the day off.
You pig!
You're a very good student.
Somebody has broken this dish.
I've come to talk with you again.
I won't be alone.
Find somebody else.
Tom started laughing.
Who's your favorite writer?
I already know Tom.
Let her go!
She built it.
Do you want to tell her?
Whose is this bag?
I'll try to live up to your expectations.
Nobody listens.
I want to learn Esperanto.
Help me, please.
Nobody cares.
With whom am I speaking?
Tom will like me.
Brothers!
I want a new dress.
Tom loves a good party.
This is from Australia.
Tom quit smoking.
Somebody has to stop Tom.
Team up.
What kind of girls do you like?
Your moment has arrived!
Try to keep Tom occupied.
Why didn't you bring it home?
She disappeared.
Did you give Tom a present for his birthday?
Construction should start in October.
Tom can be insufferable at times.
Do you know how to program?
Are you sick?
Listen.
Don't talk!
I am for your opinion.
Nothing.
Has anyone ever faced an ogre?
Day is breaking.
Do you have rice?
He loves himself.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't do that again.
Tom paid.
Tom gradually moved closer to Mary.
How much bread did you eat?
The boy is very honest.
French is very difficult to learn.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
Finally, it's snowing!
He refuses to believe her.
Whose bag is this?
You play the guitar very well.
I'm so happy for you.
I need the truth.
That house is very small.
Don't forget your money.
Enjoy your holidays.
Tom is mischievous.
Someone is watching.
Save him.
It may well be true.
Every question has an answer.
Tom would've shown you how to do that if you'd asked him.
Stop fighting!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
Tom ran outside to see what was happening.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
You may read this book.
Tom loved you.
You must look to your manners.
Somebody is or was here.
Were you here alone?
Close your eyes.
Who said that?
Good for you.
We work with what we have.
They wouldn't let me buy them drinks.
I haven't said anything yet.
My job is teaching English.
Tell them that I'm here.
I think he's gone nuts.
I need somebody to help me.
I've decided to tell the truth.
Layla heard a noise outside.
Sami was a complete nerd when he was younger.
Do both Tom and Mary understand French?
Are you home?
Where are you coming from?
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
They'll do what I tell them to do.
I didn't want Tom to stay.
Who said that?
Is that the remote control?
You're all alone.
My wife has too much work.
It is not worth saying something.
No smoking.
You have a very nice smile.
Say nothing.
Tom is kind of weird.
Why do we not go home?
I wanted somebody to talk to.
I did nothing.
Sami watched the video.
I turned right.
Remember last year.
Tom vomited blood.
Let's go dancing.
Somebody has to do it.
To your health and better days!
You can have any you want.
Enjoy yourself!
I love you bunches.
Tom works for Mary.
This gift is for you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom deserves that.
Tom Jackson is my favorite writer.
I wanted to kill you.
Nobody knows who killed Tom.
Ask!
Forget English.
Tom collects antiques.
Nobody was listening to the speech.
I'll get these.
You already paid.
Tom misses you.
Watch yourself.
I regret I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Mine's bigger than yours.
Nice car!
I know Tom is a journalist.
Eat everything you wish.
What's your favorite spectator sport?
Please remember me to all your family.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
May I ask who you are?
Forget me.
Professors should explain everything in detail, not be succinct and always tell students to go home and read their books.
Tom isn't driving his own car today.
Who's last?
Are you ready?
Are you human?
That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
Have you become insane?
Most Hollywood movies have happy endings.
That's all she wrote.
Who owns this truck?
Jump across.
Did somebody call the police?
We should inform Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
We are expecting company this evening.
Away with you!
I don't know what to say to Tom.
If we want we can, if won't we'll disappear.
I could order you to go with me.
Who sows the wind harvests the storm, they say.
Tom drank.
Action!
Seriously?
Are you drunk?
The famous Kabyle writer Mouloud Feraoun, cowardly assassinated by the OAS in 1962, would have said: "It is only when we become another that we can know who we are."
I need someone to help me.
He will study French.
I think that it's a beautiful place.
Come here.
I suspect that Tom and Mary are tired.
Don't talk to Tom.
How long?
Sami didn't need that.
The path that will save us the journey is the one that we take directly.
I hope Tom is scared.
He didn't help his father.
I hurried home.
Human religion is more open than divine religion.
I didn't hear a thing.
Don't leave!
I don't eat raw fish.
I eat and drink.
I thought that you'd recognize Tom.
Examine it.
Leave everything.
I am not a girl.
Do you like dogs?
Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sami did not like that.
She tried to influence my decision.
Tom wasn't kind to Mary.
Whom do you expect?
I want to know who is coming with us.
Somebody has to stop you.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I just wanted to tell you I love you.
Who is your brother?
Were you here alone?
Sami had known Layla for years.
Take cover!
Mine's bigger than yours.
You could kill someone.
Beauty fades.
I don't understand what the teacher said.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
He spent a few months in Scotland.
I'm eating beans.
We try.
Your time has arrived!
Why?
No idea.
Did you read Tahar Djaout's book "The Last Summer of Reason"?
You are an idiot!
Please tell Tom to come in.
Will you be in Boston next week, too?
Did someone contact you?
She can't love you.
Tom lives in Australia.
Tom repeated the word several times.
Tom's hair is black.
Don't forget your phone.
It's not a problem at all!
The snake doesn't kiss!
Did you see my sister?
How can correct mistakes of writing in kabylian in LibreOffice?
Why are you alone?
The Muslims' God understands only Arabic; but one can pray to other gods in any language.
Your father is a good-looking man.
You need a good woman.
Something's missing.
Please lend me your car.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Have another cookie.
What are you going to eat for lunch?
What happened in Boston?
I know Tom is from Australia.
Tell him tomorrow.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Why don't you ever do that?
Let Tom go.
Tom divorced Mary.
Mistakes happen.
Somebody should do something.
Get lost!
Just talk with them.
I'd like to see your sister.
What were they drinking?
Now I am learning English.
We're going to do it again.
I couldn't speak French when I first got there.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
What would you like her to do?
Thanks, that's all.
Tom is getting married in October.
Don't you think you'll be able to solve the problem by yourself?
Is there somebody you want to see?
Sami was trying to keep a positive vibe.
Sami was very immature.
Both of my parents were born in Boston.
He asked his friend.
The room is a mess.
Tom isn't likely to get into Harvard.
I didn't think that you'd talk to me.
The government oppressed the people.
My grandfather loved reading.
I'd like to see my son.
Tom loves his work.
Sami wasn't satisfied.
What did your lawyer tell you?
Open your eyes.
I'm an atheist.
Understand?
You make me feel dizzy!
He knows how to play with words.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
Roll down your window.
He's coming tonight.
Tom looks tired.
Write me sometime, OK?
He cheated on her!
Are you Japanese?
I got closer.
How I have missed you!
I loved her.
Tom is rude.
Can you do as much?
Tom dropped his daughter off at school.
Awesome!
They yelled.
Slowly, please.
Start singing.
Tom was born on the 20th of October.
Tell me what I should've done.
This is for you.
Mary says she thinks Tom did that.
Are you dressed?
Show yourself.
Tom loved us both.
I want to make her happy.
My father is a doctor.
Tom whistled.
He backed his car into the garage.
He can speak.
You're all set.
Why do you want to go?
We should've done that.
Tom was in Boston on October 20th.
Do you allow me to stay over this night?
He was riddled with several bullets.
Tom causes me a lot of extra work.
Someone's outside.
You have a green book.
When will you leave?
Is there something troubling you?
Did they check them?
Each sentence has its syllables' number.
What time do you want to eat?
Somebody killed Tom.
I think Tom is probably suspicious.
Finish studying.
He darkens the room.
Please fix it.
You think I need to do that, don't you?
Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
Mary agreed.
Beauty fades.
They lost.
Polish is my native language.
Nobody was listening to the speech.
My arms are empty.
Tom called Mary.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
I'm leaving next week.
I heard something.
Tom is a junkman.
Tom said we should be patient.
Forget Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Whatever!
I know Tom is courteous.
Somebody poisoned us.
I called my attorney.
How much money do teachers make?
What do you read?
Tom began talking.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Women like to talk.
I'll take you up on your offer.
Tom isn't likely to want to do that with us.
Will someone tell me what has happened here?
I haven't kissed Tom yet.
No kidding.
I'm Russian.
Is there somebody you want to see?
We'll send somebody.
Did someone contact you?
Somebody's waiting for you.
Tom isn't polite.
I haven't been home since October.
I didn't eat very much.
Tom betrayed Mary.
Give it back!
Your job hangs by a thread.
I misunderstood.
I studied.
I have no idea.
You make me feel dizzy!
I had assumed the same.
Someone's calling.
Close your eyes.
Is something troubling you?
I've been waiting for hours.
Sami followed Layla on Instagram and she followed him back.
Somebody has died.
We suspected him of lying.
Stop that!
Please stay.
You fell.
Put your room in order.
I did smoke when I was young.
Tom was humiliated.
Thanks, Sherlock.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
Nobody listens.
We'll talk to Tom on October 20th.
Can't you eat with us?
Are you crazy?
Sami got in Layla's car.
I told Tom that I wouldn't go shopping with hime.
Oh, seriously?
You're a vet, aren't you?
Tom spoke to the crowd.
I'll arrive on the 20th of October.
How many books do you read a month?
You are in Boston.
Tom is pretty talkative.
Could somebody tell me why Tom is angry?
Do you remember when you did that?
Tom is dying.
Welcome.
You look like you're certain.
He feels good.
They stopped.
Call Tom immediately.
Tom needs someone to help him.
Does that price include soup and salad?
How much cheese did you eat?
All right.
Tom'll stay.
Tom and Mary explained why they were there.
I'm originally from Australia.
They told me few days ago.
I'm supposed to be in Australia next Monday.
Tom wanted to hug Mary.
You are so smart!
The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
Hey, Ayako, make your voice louder.
Let him do it.
Tom is going to be here next week.
Tom is present, isn't he?
I like traveling.
Are you eating right?
You are fired.
You are an idiot!
We don't use force unless necessary.
Someone coughed.
Tom was unshaven.
Sami is going to the football game.
You're eating.
It is the rooster who makes the call to prayer in Kabylia.
Tom has been lying to Mary.
Somebody could get hurt.
In any case, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
Ask Alex.
Stop arguing.
I didn't know you had a brother.
Nobody asked you.
He likes taking walks.
Nobody listens.
Follow that car.
Get your carcass out of here!
Did you see something?
I love this game.
I take care of my body.
I'm not your slave!
He is old.
The kids are making too much noise.
Read this.
I won't leave you.
Tom is going to law school.
He speaks five languages.
Have another.
Stay here.
We'll stay with him.
Wait for him.
Somebody laughed.
Write it in French.
Put your room in order.
We hope it doesn't happen again.
Tom set this record.
Do you remember me?
He dug his own grave.
Tom isn't able to feed himself.
Do you think Tom likes me?
Please go home.
Take your time.
I am happy.
She rejected his offer of help.
Did you check her?
Stop reading.
I understand you know a lot about Australia.
Tom is the lead researcher.
You are an idiot!
You are so pretentious!
Tom wanted to marry Mary.
We should inform Tom.
You must have dropped your phone in your haste to catch the bus.
I've already read this book.
Aren't you going to join me?
Clearly you are mistaken.
He is scared of death.
Did you see something?
Be vigilant.
Not yet.
You are formidable!
The Kabyle people love all peoples of the world.
Are you thirsty?
We must respect the rights of the individual.
Sami didn't press charges.
Can I have a bite?
Where are we now?
He sometimes forgets to take books back to the library.
Get upstairs.
Tom loved French in high school.
Each sentence has its syllables.
Do you want to eat now?
Shut the door.
I've got to leave soon.
Tom isn't in Boston at this time.
Tom told me you didn't win.
What was the name of that little shop in Boston where Tom worked?
Almost.
Nothing hurts like the truth.
She sued him.
Are you a foreigner?
Someone's calling.
Go find somebody who can help.
Where did you cook them?
Escape!
Nobody hates you.
I know we're different.
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
I willingly give the grain to the hase and I even give up the straw.
You speak like your mother.
Why hasn't Tom texted me back?
Tom has been in prison since October.
If you eat that, you'll die.
I hope that you had a wonderful day.
What is that?
Have you ever learned how to play the guitar?
What do we call you?
Tom is only interested in good-looking girls.
Somebody caught me by the arm.
Don't swim here.
Are you writing a letter?
He told me a story that you can never believe.
Layla's bridesmaids were her best friends.
I regret not staying in Boston longer.
Please leave.
Do you have a house in Australia?
They are very cheerful.
Tom cares.
Is there somebody you want to see?
Look at this.
Are you sad?
Tom brought his brother.
I hate my computer.
Do you want food?
