Never live in the past but always learn from it. 
It's almost the end of the year. 
I love you more than ever.

Such behavior can cause an accident. 
He is junior to my brother by three years. 
Let's do the math. 
I'm home early. 
Do you have a twin sister? 
Tom has three children. 
She orgasmed repeatedly. 
I think he'll understand this. 
I'm not 100% sure about that.
