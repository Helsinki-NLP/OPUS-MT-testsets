He's studying biology with great enthusiasm.
I had trouble getting the door open.
I suspect that's not going to happen.
I won't complain about that.
Doctors use medical equipment.
Did Tom give any other instructions?
She asked me to throw her the ball.
I thought I'd be fine.
I don't think it was your fault.
Have you decided on a name yet for the baby?
He seems to have been rich before.
Water temperatures in the Baltic Sea exceeded 23° C in some places.
I can't smoke.
Tom never walks anywhere.
I can't do that tonight.
Kill me with words!
Tom probably won't be able to get home by himself.
I need a taxi!
Tom needs to relax.
This is not a fish.
María is reading all of Dostoevsky's works.
If you'd been there, we would've had a good time together.
Tom, she's your mother.
They were alone in the library.
I wonder whether it'll snow tomorrow.
Do you have a match?
Walk slowly.
Tom continued looking around.
Does anyone know how Tom will be going to Australia?
He is tall and handsome.
I don't think Tom's answer is wrong.
It can't be done alone.
He wrote her a letter.
Tom and Mary should probably tell John they're hungry.
Tom and Mary need to wait for John.
Tom is supposedly very wealthy.
I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
I don't know who Tom plans on going to the zoo with.
Do you love your mother?
Tom is absolutely wrong.
I called Tom on his cell.
Tom isn't like us.
The swimmers are entering the water.
I'll have to go and see what I can do.
That's not butter. It's margarine.
Tom may not make it on time.
Tom and Mary wouldn't have let their own children do that.
Anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won Anthony's liking she had, somehow or other, won his respect.
I know I can always count on you.
Tom spent time with Mary.
Tom is already getting dressed.
The girl looked at him too.
It's Thursday today.
I saw Tom in the mirror so I turned around and said hi.
She wants it.
Beware!
He knew where he put his pen.
They could've gone by themselves.
We'll tell them.
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
What fun we had yesterday!
Inhale.
Tom doesn't seem to be as relaxed as Mary seems to be.
Mary said she didn't know the answer.
I think I do need some glasses.
You don't have to sit with Tom.
I've been pretty busy.
Can you give me an example?
Tom went to visit his sister in Boston.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
Sami isn't committing any crime.
Sami is studying.
How did you find a hair in the soup if I'm bald?
Would you like to contribute?
Tom and Mary don't have the ability to finish the job by themselves.
I teach French to my friends once a week.
I'm grateful you volunteered to help.
Sami open the book and started reading.
Sami named his cat Farid.
It's quite likely Tom will come.
The whole world was involved in the war.
Mary went back to her car to get her umbrella.
He fries the eggs in oil.
Tom and Mary saved all of the letters John sent them.
Sami was so skinny.
They don't use the table and chairs.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
We want to go back to Australia.
Do Tom and Mary still do that every day?
Birds fly.
Mary just got her driver's license.
The girl is extremely tall.
It's going to be six dollars because it's international.
He is not clever but stupid.
Tom corrected what Mary had written.
I lived in this house in the past.
Food!
How did Tom know we were going to be here?
Sami is going home now.
I'd like to go there with you.
It's over nine thousand!
Enjoy!
We don't know what happened to Tom.
Ask Tom to clear away the dishes.
Almost.
Do you guys know each other?
How could you understand what I'm feeling?
I saw Tom's pictures.
I used to come to Boston about once a month.
Tom told me he'd never let me down.
Did he write anything in his diary yesterday?
I like Chinese food a lot.
I knew you'd fail your French test.
Did you fill out the questionnaire?
I don't like my brother climbing the mountains.
Understood?
Do you live near Tom?
She trusts her doctors.
Tom is happy again.
You'll do great.
I wish Tom and Mary were on our team.
I would like to ask for a translator.
Tom didn't tell Mary he didn't intend to do that.
I'm not sure Tom will do that.
Oh! Show me, please.
I haven't seen him since.
Where's the shovel?
I don't have enough money to pay all my bills this month.
Choose one from among these.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
I am too lazy to go there.
Do you have a girlfriend?
A variety of people gathered at the meeting.
You can't live like that.
Don't sit on the rocks.
The company, wholly owned by NTT, is doing well.
Tom is going to need more time.
Which do you like better, bananas or apples?
Sami is a Christian.
Sami is a teenager.
It is said that there is no life on Mars.
Tom scared us.
Tom couldn't understand what the purpose of the mission was.
It isn't true that Tom saw a monster.
It's snowing where Tom and Mary are.
Sami was beaten with a heavy belt.
I hope we made the right decision.
Tom is at home for the whole day.
We should do away with this regulation.
Sami turned around and asked Layla why she was following him.
The girl is extremely tall.
I like much money.
They saw a mouse.
Nature never breaks her own laws.
He was unable to hide his tears.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are really studying French.
Tom couldn't think of right words to say.
I could have helped.
I almost never eat breakfast.
Wait for us.
We're not taking questions.
They haven't yet admitted they did that.
Did you go shopping yesterday?
Why do we need to find her?
You're the only person I know who likes getting up early in the morning.
Tom and Mary aren't very hungry, are they?
Layla managed to crawl to the doorway.
Sami struck Layla in the neck.
From my position, I cannot see the tower.
When was the last time you used a ruler?
Quite a few books in my library are in French.
Tom is out riding his bicycle.
Tom is at home for the whole day.
Mary told Tom she'd eat lunch with John.
I want to know exactly what you did.
I think it's not worth the risk.
The swimming pool will be closed tomorrow.
It's out of your control.
What was Tom working on?
Tom is a believer.
I didn't kill my wife.
How are you?
How can I gain her trust?
I thought I'd be fine.
You know that I love all three of you.
Mary shut herself up in her bedroom.
You wouldn't do this if Tom and Mary were here.
Tom didn't know whether Mary could drive or not.
There is a hole right there.
I saw you with Tom last Monday.
I felt a sharp pain in the stomach.
I saw Tom take your keys.
I must get in.
Sami got on Layla's Facebook.
I found Mary.
This music suits my present mood.
Tom is going home now.
Put that down!
I can't answer the phone now.
Man's life is short.
I was feeling guilty.
It's warm here all year round.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
Nobody can beat Tom.
You aren't afraid of dying, are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary went to Australia.
I saw you on TV.
Goodnight.
Sami brushed his teeth.
Yes, of course.
I wanted to become a doctor.
What kept you up all night?
Tom took risks.
He wanted me to help him today.
You weren't in Australia last year, were you?
Shameful!
I don't think that you need to tell Tom that you're planning to do that.
Are you studying chemistry?
Kazu likes sports very much.
Who will eat the apple?
You just said that to me?
You're gonna make me furious!
Why don't you remember?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to ask John for help.
Tom said that he didn't intend to do that anymore.
Give me another one.
Why don't you eat some vegetables?
I won't do that if Tom and Mary are going to do that.
You can't take it with you when you die.
Where did you do that yesterday?
Tell me your address.
Mary said she'd been offered $3,000.
You said you would give me an answer.
You had better not see her now.
Mornin'!
Mary makes her own bread.
Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't done it.
It's about 133 kilometers from London.
We've got three major problems that need to be solved.
Tom told me why it was a good idea to do that.
Tom seemed very interested in doing that.
I didn't show Tom anything.
He did it not once, but twice.
I don't use that kind of language.
Tom and Mary have said they intend to pay back all the money they owe.
You ought not do that.
My parents are going to love you.
No, I am not married.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I wasn't very busy today.
The students stood up one by one and introduced themselves.
I can't speak the Berber language, but someday I will speak it well.
Mary is on her way back home.
You should get back home the day after tomorrow.
Mary rewrote it.
Enter!
Tom nodded and left the room.
I'm plastered.
Tom asked Mary to sell him the guitar she'd inherited from her grandfather.
It isn't hard for everybody.
The weather bureau says it will rain tonight.
Dan should be ashamed of what he told me.
Tom couldn't do that by himself.
An artist is known by their work.
Does anyone here know where Tom and Mary live?
Tom and Mary consulted with their attorney.
Tell me how to use the washing machine.
Thanks for your help.
Tom is young, but he isn't innocent.
Tom worked as a waiter at one of the most popular restaurants in town.
Study!
How do you know Tom did that?
He sold me his old car.
Sami is gonna have nothing.
Boys are noisy and rude to girls.
Sami was watching what was going on.
How unlucky I am!
Tom was born rich.
I'm going to buy it.
Mary said that she wasn't happy here.
Get used to that.
He told me he wasn't sick anymore.
Here's my business card.
Tom has been on the wanted list for three years.
This is Tom's bicycle.
I didn't know Tom would be absent.
Tom put the tray down on the table.
My mom always says that she will visit me soon.
Greetings!
Tom would want us to go.
Tom and Mary are worried that something might happen to them.
They could've gone by themselves.
Yes.
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support his family.
The sky has become cloudy.
Vultures circled over the dead bodies.
They say that they're prepared to do that.
Three guesses where I was yesterday!
I've been seen.
Sami believes there is a god.
The meeting will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Most of the time he arrives late.
She told me that she'd buy it.
The burglar got away.
Do you enjoy visiting museums?
Tom is really a good dancer.
How long do frogs live?
Tom thought that his parents were perfect.
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary.
Quick!
I know what's up.
Tom looks like he's prepared.
The house was pleasant to live in.
I knew you'd fail your French test.
Mary lent all the money she had on her to me.
I'm doing well, thank you.
Show us some results.
I won't tell them you said that.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
I didn't know what to do when Tom and Mary said they wouldn't help me.
Exactly!
Tom covered the table with the new tablecloth he'd just bought.
Thanks for your help.
I'm going to take a closer look.
What are you going to do now?
Tokyo has many ancient temples.
Don't distract me anymore.
Do you have a moment to talk about Tom?
I hope to see you again in October.
Tom told Mary he'd be ready to go in three minutes.
Absolutely!
He keeps surprising me.
Can't anyone else come?
All people are not gentle.
Can you count the stars?
Okay.
Tom has promised never to do that.
A chauffeur sat in front.
We have a simple philosophy.
I will make it clear for her, just in case.
This chair is too small.
They said they were much happier now.
Tom and Mary said that they'd been careful.
You ran into him earlier, didn't you?
I am living in Volgograd.
I think you're intelligent.
What is your major?
Ask her to come tomorrow.
Think!
Tom became quite wealthy.
You didn't recognize me?
This has nothing to do with Tom.
Tom hadn't been expecting that answer.
I doubt I’ll be successful this time.
I have more questions for you.
We took risks.
We never should've left early.
Didn't Mary tell you she'd do that?
Her computer is on her bed.
I am also unemployed.
Tom, you should go, too.
Gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies . . . or forget to say thank you . . . or pull anybody's hair.
I saw Tom leave.
We need to go to Boston to help Tom.
There is a portrait of Bob on the wall.
Tom should help Mary.
You must do that more carefully next time.
Two dogs guard the entrance.
Where was Tom yesterday?
I won't die.
Sami can hear that noise.
I thought that your parents liked me.
Tom doesn't think Mary is nervous.
Mary shot me.
Breathe!
Can we get started now?
Tom is smart enough to answer all the questions.
Can you speak Turkmen?
It had all been a very big mistake.
I didn't have a good time last Sunday.
I don't think this is the only way to do this.
Do you have any idea where I might find him?
Would you like a seat?
I've never seen Tom and Mary do that before.
Study!
I think that Tom is miserable.
I don't want to live in Australia for more than a year.
Sami was very Muslim.
That's not what Tom really needs to do.
The pen is the tongue of the soul.
Japanese cars are very popular.
Pay attention to the bikes.
They looked like they were in a hurry.
The economy of the island is dependent on the fishing industry.
She promised me she'd come early.
I will check it.
She can't speak English, much less French.
I don't want to end up like her.
I will tie a rope round your waist, so that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.
Tom and Mary smiled at the camera.
Tom is from the South.
Do you like apples?
Sami didn't want to talk about that.
Tom's wife is just as crazy as he is.
Fadil waited for Layla at home.
I don't think this is the first time Tom has tried doing that.
Tom is working in Australia.
Tom sells shoes.
Tom didn't know who to ask.
Tom ran into the house to get something to drink.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
I'm going to put on some music.
I don't know where Tom and Mary want to live.
I have been waiting for the bus for an hour.
He bragged about it.
What is it you want me to do?
Really?
I think that I need glasses.
Sami is a friend from the university.
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
Tom is very young. He's much younger than Mary.
I had some interesting experiences while I was traveling.
I wish to be a doctor.
Here's a short list.
Tom spent time in Australia.
Tom and Mary said that they had found their keys.
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary.
Everyone liked her.
May I borrow your bike?
I like slow paced movies.
Tom didn't know Mary had done that.
I used it when I was in China last summer.
Sami was talking to a camera.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
He said that he only did that once.
Tom, she's your mother.
Do Tom and Mary know how much you paid for this?
And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
She has her kid with her.
Sami knows that Layla is not a bad person.
The worst solitude is to be destitute of sincere friendship.
"Does she have a dog?" "No, she doesn't."
Whatever.
Mary may have said that, but I don't think she did.
He was such a materialistic person.
I'm not Brazilian.
Good night. Sweet dreams.
How many animals do you have at home?
You'll start right now.
Mary is having fun, isn't she?
Will you come with me to the concert?
It has a hole in it.
I doubt that we'll be able to prove that.
Did you buy a car?
Let me hear your frank opinion.
I know that Tom can't speak French.
Mary said she's not making much money.
Bye-bye!
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
Tom said that Mary shouldn't tell John about what happened.
What would you do in my place?
Most of the time he arrives late.
All you have to do is give this to Tom.
What time do you usually go home?
Tom said that Mary wasn't crying.
I didn't let Tom answer Mary's questions.
Tom would do that if he had more time.
You knew me, didn't you?
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
Call a doctor immediately.
Tom is much closer to his mother than he is to his father.
Kneel!
She could get here if she wanted to.
I have to go to sleep.
He mostly talked about his trip.
He can't chew well, because he has a toothache now.
Right!
Have you ever been in Okinawa?
Better late than never.
Tom fell under Mary's spell.
Die!
He didn't understand me.
You have something to read.
I'm the one who built this house.
They grow up so fast.
Thank you for dancing with me.
He was beating his wife.
Shoot!
Tom, you should come, too.
Step forward and make room for others.
In the end, we obtained what we wanted.
Do you think Tom will pass his driving test?
The economy has entered a recession.
He was supposed to give it back to me last week.
I've already told this to the cops.
Tom and Mary said they weren't expecting John to do that.
One point.
Tom has a problem that he needs to solve.
The event starts at 3pm.
I live in Australia now, but I'm from New Zealand.
You've got ten minutes to pack your bags.
I see myself in the mirror.
I have a thing for Tom.
Sami was Layla's neighbor.
There was a chicken.
Tom and Mary aren't very hungry.
You ran a red light.
A woman is the most sweet thing in the world.
Tom and Mary say that they're too busy to help John today.
Listen as much as you want.
I'd probably have approved.
Do you have Telegram?
Tell Mary she can't go.
I was a sophomore in college the year Tom was born.
He'll need to do that by himself.
I can't say.
You were cutting the bread.
I wasn't with Tom.
Layla needed to go back to her house.
Tom dreams of world peace.
You'll need this.
His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
He wished he were taller.
Begin!
You know that I love all three of you.
My mom was a wonderful woman.
He didn't think he could do that.
Sami began to ask about Layla's daughter.
No.
Tom made plans.
She's teaching students English.
Sami never said anything about that.
Tom used the internet to look for a job.
Have Tom and Mary actually agreed to do that?
If you don't have any goal in life, you're just waiting to die.
I used to go to school with him.
I'm plowing the soil.
Sami is too stupid to see that.
What you're looking for is right here.
You must get up at six.
It'll make Tom very happy.
Tom cried himself to sleep.
Nothing transpired between us.
I think that Tom would agree to do that.
Did you forget to set your alarm, Tom?
Were you translating with the help of a dictionary?
I'm glad I'm not Tom.
You can't come in.
You must open it for her.
Tom was transferred to the head office in Boston.
If you don't stop taking the drugs, you will die soon.
I didn't know why my car wouldn't start.
Tell him you'd like to help.
She said that she's healthy.
You are not answering the question correctly.
I just can't help smoking.
Don't you have something else to do?
Tom is young and ambitious.
The flowers in the garden need water.
They said they were too tired to dance.
Escape.
I'm sorry that I had to cancel our date.
There was disagreement between Sami and Layla about the dogs.
Never!
You cannot expect much of him.
I saw Tom's birth certificate.
May fifth is Children's Day.
Tom kept me from joining the group.
Maja Keuc is a good singer.
I want to drive.
The wedding's been called off.
Her face turned white at the news.
Mary says she likes horror movies.
Tom has proven that.
We have something we need to tell Tom.
I was told that I should see a doctor.
Straighten your legs.
You'll need some of these.
Return that book when you have read it, please.
Her computer is on her bed.
I will try.
Tom can't stand up straight anymore.
I know you.
The next meeting will be held at Tom's new residence.
I should have advised Tom to wait.
Do you like ravioli?
Tom and Mary say they don't want to talk to you.
Tom is one of the nicest kid I've ever taught.
You were the one who did that, weren't you?
Where'd you buy that scarf?
Forget him.
This morning's meeting was shorter than usual.
Having met him before, I recognized him at once.
You don't eat anything.
Tom doesn't know this is a tough situation.
You don't have to come up with an unusual topic for your speech.
You rewrote it, didn't you?
Tom is pretty bad at French, isn't he?
Tom couldn't understand why Mary never came to visit him.
I wish that I hadn't been late for the exam.
I know that even the most beautiful kiss must come to an end.
That's the way things were back then.
I don't have to go right away.
I thought I would be able to do that.
Tom was first one to do that.
I'm going to Australia on Monday.
Do you and Tom still hate each other?
What do you do?
I just bought myself a new jacket.
Go.
I won't let you do it.
He arrived in China in October 2014 and soon established himself comfortably in Taiyuan.
I don't know if you'd understand.
Sami went to say hello to Layla.
Tom's clothes are soaking wet.
I watched TV.
I don't want to stay here tonight.
He leads me into the stable, and urges me to choose from all the horses whichever I would like.
Tom and Mary started laughing when I told them what John had done.
You and I seem to be the only people here.
Please answer all the questions.
I see a red car ahead.
Tom and Mary played with their cats.
I thought Tom and Mary weren't allowed to eat candy.
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Are you resourceful?
Has it ever happened before?
I heard Tom playing the violin.
From now on, I will not use that word.
Did you ask Mary why she didn't want to do that?
He refused to let me in his room.
We could make it on time if we walked a little faster.
Are you listening to me?
What's not right?
Tom visits Mary every time he's in Boston.
She sold some apples at the market.
She has nobody to blame but herself.
Why is Tom here? He should be in school.
Tom asked Mary what her father did for a living.
Sami is reading Layla's diary.
Green vegetation is on the decrease on Earth.
They were together three years.
Hmm.
Whose friend is he?
She lost her way in the forest.
How would you react if your wife told you that?
Tom said he hopes to keep working here for several more years.
No?
Did he ask you to spy on me?
I arrived just when Tom and Mary were leaving.
Smaller classes mean a higher standard of education, and that's what we want for our kids.
He fell in love with one of his students.
What's that horrible noise?
Tom may be awake now.
I was born and raised in Matsuyama.
I'd prefer red wine.
I know what I have to do today.
You did that, didn't you?
You can't compete with Tom.
She warned you.
Don't forget to wish Tom a happy birthday.
Many people lack humility.
Tom is likely to get lost.
Tom came here to use my computer.
Tom is counting money now.
See above.
I work afternoons.
I'm a new employee at Microsoft.
Tom said that he'd be back soon.
All is over.
He had to share his bedroom with his brother.
He balked at the suggestion that he give ten percent of his income to charity.
I want to study German in addition to English.
Sami doesn't want to meet Layla's dad.
I'm not being unreasonable.
She cannot be accepted.
I dream about her a lot.
Both flowers with the same value.
Come with all possible speed.
Don't let this get wet.
She shot me.
I will make it clear for you, just in case.
They warned you.
This university is highly selective.
Tell me what should be done.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't bored.
The magician made the young lady float into the air.
I think I'll go see Tom and Mary and ask them what they think.
I told you to never speak to me again.
He shared his entire life story with me.
Tom was able to trick Mary.
Tom told me that he knew where Mary lived.
Do you have time to help me?
I would give more, but I don't have any left.
Nothing happened.
I'll be in Australia next week.
He is thirty years old.
"I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday," said Anne.
How many girls are there in this picture?
What beautiful weather!
He was seen to throw garbage into forest.
She found him more handsome than ever.
I didn't know that you had a dog.
Tom lives in a small town on the outskirts of Boston.
The girl has spent all day crying.
He has the habit of reading the newspaper while he eats.
Understand?
Tom said that he thought that we could win.
I just bought a house.
She didn't finish her dinner.
He said that he would not sell the garden.
I won't tell her.
She's concerned about her future.
Wow!
How many cats do you have?
If he doesn't write, I will not write him anymore.
Can you play the piano well?
Tom even argued with the judge.
We're only here to help them.
We all make mistakes, but people forget them.
Walk.
I don't love you any less than I do her.
How many animals do you have at home?
Which would be more convenient for you, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?
Is that too heavy for you?
I always keep an eye on Tom.
I'm not even capable of pinpointing Germany on a map! I'm ashamed!
Follow me.
Tom and Mary are waiting for Tom to come.
Tom works in our Boston office.
Let me tell you what needs to be done.
Tom and Mary have said that they won't do that again.
Tom is truly a fascinating person.
They want it.
He married for money.
You should have locked, or at least closed, all the doors.
I don't like to be corrected in public.
She said she didn't agree with you.
I was taking pictures.
You can't mix oil and water.
She borrowed my shirt without asking.
What is that on the wall?
Come!
I can't answer that question.
Can you stop it?
He hates snakes.
I think doing that would help.
He said he enjoyed it.
Mary said she wanted something hot to drink.
Look at what we made.
I saw what was happening.
Some people think that French is a hard language to learn.
You're not the only one who cares about Tom.
Some people are not willing to change their eating habits.
Mary's parents told her that playing with fire was dangerous.
I'm sure that Tom and John are very busy men.
"I like teaching, too," said Gilbert.
Mary often lies about her age.
Have a good vacation.
I've dealt with the matter.
Did you say this to me?
Mary moved as quickly as she could.
Tom isn't much of a talker.
Tom would like it if somebody did that.
I've known Tom since we went to school together.
Aren't you going to be there?
I know I can count on all of you.
I want to wait until Tom gets here.
I'd like to offer you your job back.
Tom and I lived in the same house and went to the same school.
I left Australia three weeks ago.
I had my pocket picked in the train.
Mary went to sleep happy.
Gotcha.
Sami was having his lunch.
Sami talked about that in a separate video.
Tom would never just let you win.
Tom and Mary are better than you.
You know this isn't fair.
I dream about her a lot.
They're still in Boston.
Those sorts of hats are seen often.
Hopefully!
Tom beat me at darts.
We sold our forest.
Tom has nothing to worry about.
Hey, sist!
I haven't actually said no yet.
I saw Tom with Mary the other night.
Tom is a good listener, isn't he?
I don't think Tom can help you with that.
Do you love your mother?
I want to thank you for picking Tom up after school.
One thing is certain: Algeria is changing.
According to the paper, there was an earthquake in Mexico.
I've been to Australia more times than Tom has.

He knows that you know that.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
What did you do today at school?
Tom wearily closed his eyes.
Go more slowly.
Tom loved his grandchildren.
I don't think that Tom will be in Australia next week.
We're not going to lose, are we?
The doctor told Mr Smith to give up smoking.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know where he's going.
I just want to know what actually happened.
Tom didn't get anything.
Tom always makes fun of me.
They had to cancel the trip.
He knows that you know that.
Did you have a cold last week?
Are you good at playing basketball?
My father didn't eat much fruit.
Faggot.
Mary has lived there all her life.
This door is locked from inside.
The sun went down behind the mountains.
That is not altogether bad.
How do I know this is real?
Tom and Mary are quite confident that'll happen.
Tom should probably not tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
This water is polluted, do not drink it.
Tom and Mary said they were mugged by three men.
Welcome.
Let's ask for it.
All students have access to the library.
He will go to the dentist.
Monday morning I was bitten by a dog.
I wonder why Tom is so popular.
Tom's mother told him to come home.
Sami's dog scared Layla's cat.
It is strictly forbidden to translate this sentence!
War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.
I don’t think I’ll succeed.
That's a lie!
I'm not old.
What motivated these kids?
Tom tried his best to calm Mary down.
I think that's a small piece of sausage.
Tom is still somewhere in the building, I think.
Did you hear how quickly he speaks?
You don't have to like Mary. You just have work with her.
Tom doesn't live far away.
Do Tom and Mary still want to go with us?
Mary let us know that she had arrived.
Shit.
Mary wants it.
Don't worry. These things happen.
Tom is probably in Boston.
Tom ate lunch at his desk.
I'm pretty sure that Tom is in love with Mary.
I live near Boston.
Once I helped her.
They scared us.
Tom died during the sweltering heat of August in Atlantic City.
Tom and Mary admitted that they'd been careless.
Everything is under the table.
Mary shouldn't do that by herself.
It was very considerate of you to do that for Tom.
I don't have a clue.
Tom did everything he possibly could to help.
Both flowers with the same value.
It happened over a year ago.
Hugs!
I know that Tom misses you.
She's a fisherwoman.
Play!
During the night it's very cold.
Are your grandchildren here in Australia?
I don't remember how I got home last night.
There's no hope for you.
Absolutely!
I thought that Tom was going to win.
Sami always talked about money.
A good citizen obeys the laws.
We will have some visitors one of these days.
He waited for the elevator to come down.
This is a big help.
Ask Tom and Mary what they've done.
What part of Canada do you come from?
Did you really not know Tom couldn't speak French?
How's everything with you?
Mary didn't get up this morning as early as she usually does.
Exactly!
Nothing will ever change here.
We were fascinated by her voice.
Tom told me to shut up.
I must get in.
I saw Tom running down the street.
You have the same answer to everything.
I think that Tom will call Mary.
Do you want a job?
Mary herself might have done that.
He got in his car and drove away.
Nevermore!
It would be disappointing if Tom did that.
She will be jealous.
I will try.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be cooperative.
People say I mumble.
I know Tom lied.
The sports car was going so fast it was just a blur as it passed by.
You can deceive fools.
Keep quiet.
I have so many questions.
Sami knows Layla is sick.
This car belongs to you, doesn't it?
Sami won't agree with Layla.
I put my wife's glasses on by mistake.
You ought to tell Tom to do that more carefully.
I am sorry.
Sami's mom went home.
The pen is the tongue of the soul.
I hope Tom knows who wants to do that.
He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches.
Grapes grow on vines.
Don't sit on these boxes.
You didn't know Tom was going to do that, did you?
I knew Tom wouldn't know how to do that.
It is not easy to distinguish good from evil.
I wasn't the one who yelled.
The goldfish is alive.
This one's not working either.
What did you do this morning?
Tom will miss Mary a lot.
Can you please tell me how deep this lake is?
Tom isn't going to let that happen.
The person who's helping Tom is Mary.
They've done everything they can.
I think that Tom needs glasses.
Tom and Mary took their pens out of their pockets.
I'm a doctor.
I am your fan.
Tom is going to be happy to see you again.
I try.
Tom was absent from school all last week.
I cannot say.
It's 2:30 right now.
I am very patient, but I have to go home, now.
Tom will go to Boston with me.
Mary is usually with her friends.
I didn't think there was any reason why we needed to do that.
Can you open the door, please?
I can't take your money.
I think I'm a lucky guy.
Hungry?
She never mentioned it again.
Tom told Mary not to worry about what might happen on October 20th.
Thanks a lot, Tom, but no thanks.
I didn't have enough time to do everything that had to be done.
This is an error.
I want to go to Boston with Tom.
That one is big.
Hopefully!
I can't condone what you did.
I saw Tom last weekend at the club.
The world could use a lot more people like her.
Tom and Mary are a perfect match.
I think that Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Did he write anything in his diary yesterday?
Why does Tom want to be a carpenter?
If you don't have a pen, use a pencil.
Since early childhood, he dreamed of writing stories.
Sami was trying to protect me.
I don't ever want that to change.
Hurray!
Did I mention that he's handsome?
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
Many firms are competing for the wealthier segment of the market.
Now, listen!
Keep far away from him!
Sami was Layla's romantic getaway.
Please tell him I'm sorry.
Tom and Mary eat lunch by themselves every day.
Tom said that he didn't do that.
You seem confident.
Sami practised yoga for a while.
That was nifty.
We're going to the market.
Literature is a nation's future.
That makes it difficult.
Tom is doing a good job, isn't he?
I have grapes.
Tom hasn't asked a single question.
I could not for the life of me figure out what was wrong.
Tom is going to visit me tonight.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think John would let me do that.
I'm going to wash my hands.
Read after me.
Tom knew I was involved.
I'm sorry, but I can't stay for long.

Was Tom seriously hurt?
I want to live.
You'd be perfect for this job.
Mary told Tom about her problems.
Tom said that he might never come back.
I have a dog.
I don't want to wake the kids up.
Help me.
Do what you consider needed.
When was it purchased?
Look at what we did.
I'm sure.
He has many talents.
The university was founded by his father twenty years ago.
Translate this text.
Move out of my way.
Come here.
Aren't you going to buy that?
Tom thought that he'd found the perfect hiding place.
Goal!
Tender kisses.
But your ex is a psychopath!
The bird is in the sky.
I know what Tom is like.
Bye!
You should allow Tom to do that.
Dinner was awesome.
He hates snakes.
I had to tell the truth.
There's someone inside.
A quarrel between husband and wife is like a spring day's drizzle.
Unfortunately, that's completely impossible to do.
Is it all resolved now?
You haven't yet convinced Tom to do that, have you?
I'd like to spend my next summer vacation hiking and camping.
Nobody came.
I teach French to my friends once a week.
They focused on their work.
I know that you've been worried about Tom.
Contact Tom Jackson for details.
They said that they felt better.
I need medical assistance.
Learning a foreign language as a non-native speaker is hard work, but all that effort pays off when you realise you can communicate with someone from a completely different country in their language.
Will you drive me home?
Tom said he didn't mind.
All people are not gentle.
I remember when Tom and Mary were babies.
Why me?
People should mind their own business first and foremost.
I looked for my cup, but didn't find it.
She likes coffee, doesn't she?
Look at what we made.
I heard Tom walking up the steps.
The choice is all up to you.
Why is Tom here? He should be in school.
He needs to change his socks.
Let's stop doing that.
"There is no right or wrong way to get fat," said Tom.
What we know is that Fadil sometimes beat Layla.
It's on top.
I've done nothing else.
I had a good summer vacation.
Tom and Mary don't want to study music.
Louder, please.
She has a rich boyfriend.
She says she feels the same way.
This music suits my present mood.
You must work more.
Who knows?
This will affect Sami for the rest of his life.
Let's play cards instead.
Don't let anyone open the windows.
Aren't you going to introduce me?
You never told me why you didn't do that.
Do you understand?
I know why you want this job.
She said that she was jealous.
Mary never talks about what she does at work.
Tom didn't answer Mary's question.
It's quite clear that Tom doesn't want to be here.
We're not here to judge.
My roommate, who can't hold his liquor, came home after the party and barfed all over my new shoes!
Don't you recognize me?
Tom didn't seem to want to say something.
Where?
Tom will miss Mary a lot.
Do you know how to use this?
Tom didn't tell me that he didn't have a driver's license.
Sami didn't offend anybody.
Two dogs guard the entrance.
Tom is now on some sort of secret mission.
You should read the introduction at the beginning of the book.
She told me she was a doctor.
I like fish more than meat.
Tom wanted to hire us both, but his boss would only let him hire one of us.
We've already decided not to leave early.
It was a wonderful morning.
I lied about it.
I owe Tom an apology.
Mary takes good care of her car.
Tom was first one to do that.
Do you think you're smarter than Tom?
You might need the calculator now.
I always spend Christmas Day with my parents.
I'll be here this evening.
I should've explained everything to Tom.
Tom might not make it in time.
Thanks for trying.
Wait!
She can't see without her glasses.
Why is Esperanto an underestimated language?
May I borrow your bike?
Please tell Tom to do that at 2:30.
All hope is gone.
I can't come over tonight.
They contradict themselves constantly.
I don't want to read anything else.
Can you read that sign ahead of us?
Who are you calling stupid?
Sami probably would have loved it.
Look at what we did.
The interview began at 10 o'clock.
May fifth is Children's Day.
We turned the offer down.
I decided to be a doctor.
Tom is going to be happy to see you again.
Is that all I am to you?
Mary gave Tom directions to her house.
Is there room in your car for me?
Who gave you that envelope?
An absence of rain caused wild plants to die.
I watched you.
Sami and Layla told each other all about their past.
You already know about what Tom did, don't you?
You stay out of my life and I stay out of yours, OK?
The solution of one may prove to be the solution of the other.
I know what you said.
Tom has about half as many books as I do.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it'd be.
Sami didn't stop filming.
Please close the fridge.
Tom is graduating tomorrow.
Zoom in on this picture so we can better see it.
Mary admitted that she hadn't been honest.
How much is she paying you?
Both Tom and Mary have dyed their hair.
Seriously?
We'll talk to Tom on October 20th.
Hi.
Mary is the same age as Tom.
Tom was close to tears.
Tom asked for a back massage.
Quitting one's job in a big way is cathartic but is it the right thing to do?
Just say nothing.
If you want to become a good writer, you need to practice writing.
Tom wasn't the one who told me you wanted to do that.
Tom is already quite drunk, isn't he?
Why aren't you interested?
It didn't take Tom much time to do that.
We need to speak to Tom.
Could you come and help?
Tom said that nobody else was there.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be impartial.
Keep far away from him!
Sami bought shampoo for his dog.
I believe that I've seen the document that you're talking about.
It is said that she is ill.
Tom spent a lot of time checking his homework.
Tom and Mary said they enjoyed last night's party.
Oh, that's a shame.
There's actually plenty to do in Australia.
You know what this is, don't you?
I know that you don't believe me.
Sami forgot Layla's room number.
Tom wanted a divorce.
The entire crew takes pride in its work.
We thought that we wouldn't be able to stop him.
I can't take your money.
I knew that Tom would have enough money.
Tom and Mary have become close.
My mouth was full so I couldn't answer.
We'll show them who we are.
Nothing happened between us.
Goodbye.
I'm afraid that's no longer possible.
Sami's restaurant was in the mall but it had its own entrance.
Sami read all those books.
I thought Tom would be present at today's meeting.
I must do that carefully.
I've never met a kinder man than Tom.
I teach Tom's children French three times a week.
Tom was told by his doctor to remain in bed.
Enough!
I forgot to speak with Tom.
Each of the girls was dressed neatly.
He hates snakes.
You can't compete with us.
When are you coming back to Boston?
He'd be fired if he didn't do that.
Look above that building.
Do you think it means something?
I am all ears.
I am not married.
Why is Tom here? He should be in school.
I'm Tom's dentist.
We are writing an email for our friends.
He came into the hospital to visit me.
Sami stepped back.
Almost all of Tom's ex-wives are friends with Mary.
Write your name in full.
Clip your nails.
Would you like to go fishing with us?
Thank you, Jesus.
That smells bad.
You're not well, are you?
It is better to risk saving a guilty man than to condemn an innocent one.
As soon as you tell me how, I'll do it.
My answer may surprise you.
Had he tried it once more, he would have succeeded in it.
She made plans.
How do you spell "bludgeon"?
The car isn't clean but dirty.
Dan was responsible for twenty-eight bank robberies.
Sami is now fifty years old.
I thought Tom would come alone.
Tom doesn't need to come.
Goodbye.
You were sitting in front of the glass with beer.
That makes me anxious.
It was a tough exam.
Tom lives in Boston with his wife and his three children.
Can you open the door, please?
How many hours did you work yesterday?
Tom wanted to find out the cause of the accident.
Even though Tom is a child, he knows the difference between right and wrong.
Mary said she didn't smoke.
Tom has questions, too.
Sami took two of his dogs out for a walk.
This should work.
It is not easy to translate.
Mary is alone, isn't she?
Tom and Mary shouldn't have stayed here by themselves.
I'll put the kettle on and we'll have some tea.
I really wanted to do that with you.
I hate walking.
Tom and Mary don't eat anything except the vegetables that they grow themselves.
Have you got anything to read?
Death motivates me to live.
He is not going to be cold.
Tom told Mary she was his one and only.
That was a good guess.
I don't think Tom knows everybody's name yet.
Sami can't hear anything.
We don't get much rain.
Were you translating with the help of a dictionary?
I learned by heart 2000 English words.
They said that they'd never teach French.
I wish Tom and Mary were on our team.
Buy!
You're still taller than me.
That's very vague.
I don't want to do that like that.
What does that mean, exactly?
He became famous throughout the world.
Is that all I am to you?
I was talking about him.
Manon is not like the other girls.
I think that's a very stupid argument.
Mary did everything I told her to.
She has been told she can't do that.
Mark is so honest that everyone praises him for it.
She is a British citizen but her native land is France.
Do you think I ask too many questions?
I think Tom and Mary are too young to be dating.
It's starting to get light.
Don't cry in public.
Tom and Mary live with their father in Australia.
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary wants to buy with the money her father gave her.
Tom is lucky to be on the team.
I have no idea.
We deserve better.
Do you believe war will start?
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
They don't worry about what's going to happen tomorrow.
I don't want to read anything else.
What exactly are we having this party for?
These people are anything but innocent.
I don't advise them to buy this car.
Do you believe in afterlife?
I did it because everybody else did.
Probably.
Do you really know why I'm here?
Corals are a beautiful and important part of our ocean.
She cannot be accepted.
The entire nation was glad at the news.
I will try.
That's something to think about.
Stars are shining.
I studied French for three years.
Tom hasn't promised us anything.
Those are my cats.
You should at least tell Tom that you don't want to do that anymore.
Mary said she didn't know anything about that.
I almost forgot to put my passport in my pocket.
Sami drove everyone home.
Tom and Mary dipped their toes into the water.
Where did he stay last night?
Tom wasn't really tired.
We're husband and wife.
Don't give them any ideas.
We will not do it.
Tom stood in front of Mary.
"Well, there's something I'd like your advice on about my research project ..." "Let's see... Hmm, you're investigating flowering plants then."
Drop your weapons!
I gained their trust.
There is a military base near here.
Aren't you going to go there?
You're the only person I know who likes getting up early in the morning.
I had to fire them.
Does she speak English?
This photo is my favourite!
Tom knows how to talk to children.
You should advocate disarmament.
He met his stepsister for the first time today.
Who are your favourite stars?
The horse is not white.
You recovered quickly.
Cars pollute a lot.
Tom barely recognized Mary.
Where did you hide them?
I'm not your teacher anymore.
Turn off the fan when you're done reading the book.
No thanks, that's not my thing.
I'm really happy.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be busy.
Tom will get back from Australia this week or next week.
Faster!
Tom says that he has a secret weapon.
I'm not going to study tonight.
There was a Brazilian girl in my class last year.
Please.
Let's be thankful for everything we have.
All three of my sisters died in the accident.
There are a lot of rocks in this garden.
He'll be back in two hours. In the meantime, let's prepare dinner.
I was angry.
Nothing.
Tom couldn't stop the tears.
Can any of your friends speak French?
Tom and Mary say that they're not angry.
Smile.
Look!
I doubt that Tom will cry.
I didn't know that you were such a good cook.
I am boring.
When you're 17, you don't understand those who are over 40.
Sami succeeded.
No one thinks that way anymore.
I don't know why Tom and Mary aren't happy.
Tom hugged his parents.
Nothing, I'm not eating anything right now.
María is reading all of Dostoevsky's works.
I saw you give it to Tom.
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment.
Whoa!
Could you press this button?
My thirteen-year-old daughter is going on her first date tomorrow.
I will come.
I'm grateful you volunteered to help.
Don't walk on the grass!
Mary thought she heard a dog barking.
I don't want him to hear.
I don't think Tom was disappointed with the results.
A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
He cut down a tree in his yard.
I know you.
I need to be ready when Tom and Mary arrive.
Sami was still reluctant to call the police.
I see no other course of action.
Are you still waiting for Tom?
Tom is almost always cheerful.
I know Tom is a lazy person.
Have you ever looked around and taken note of the people who were in your life?
Tom and Mary didn't mention what they'd done.
Sami liked the babysitter a lot.
You're supposed to be downstairs.
Do you think it would be better to write Tom a letter?
Can I come, too?
Sami has a brand new car.
I heard a loud noise.
Japan is now very different from what it was twenty years ago.
You must give it to them.
You accept Tom's suggestions.
I am not old.
I thought Tom wouldn't recognize Mary.
I went to Paris.
Tom is coughing again.
I had my pocket picked in the train.
She kicked him.
I wasn't expecting guests.
Tell her where we've gone.
You're my son.
We can save a little time if we do what Tom and Mary suggest.
Kill!
Maybe Tom and Mary weren't hungry.
Layla will never forget Sami's eyes.
Who'll be in Boston with you?
She opened her eyes again.
The horse is black.
It's about 30 minutes from here on foot.
Stay away from the dangerous neighborhoods.
Where's the beach?
I don't know how long the concert will last.
Tom saw a light in the distance.
Mary looks like she's alone.
This is a letter from Canada.
Mary was willing to do that, but Tom said she didn't have to.
Mary's grandmother is toothless.
We could write a book.
Ask Tom and he'll tell you the same thing.
I'm getting used to this new machine.
Tom thought his parents were perfect.
The jewel was stolen during the night.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't helped.
I am not rich but poor.
Sami felt really uncomfortable.
Who are Tom and Mary going to listen to?
My phone's ringing.
Tom will get it next time.
Journalists collect information with the goal of providing the most accurate version of events.
Careful!
We saw a boy run over by a truck.
I decided to take his side against the others.
I'll turn around while you change.
I can't even find time to read.
Mary says she doesn't know anybody here.
Tom wanted to do that this morning.
I think we're going to return soon.
She's a lot tougher than she looks.
That's where I want to live!
He who hits my dog, doesn't really love me either.
Do you often go to the movies?
If it rains tomorrow, the tour will be cancelled.
I think that Tom will call Mary.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Tom lay on a sofa with his eyes closed.
You never told me where you lived.
I think that Tom is a really nice kid.
Don't talk to your mother that way.
I thought I'd wear a tie.
Sami kept looking at the hoodies.
He's not sick.
Tom asked if he was really required to do that.
When will the repair be finished?
There's not a single car on the street.
What?
He slowly raised the gun.
Why did you let Tom and Mary do that?
I didn't think Tom would tell you how to do that.
All were present.
Tom and Mary often play chess together.
I can't approve your plan.
I was plenty nervous.
Do you go shopping every week?
Have you heard how fast he talks?
Tom went to visit his sister in Boston.
He's no less than forty years old.
I won my first gold medal.
Mary and Kate talked about their school and their friends.
He doesn't take care of his health.
He's a very clever boy.
Have you been talking to him?
Can you open the door, please?
He is just an ordinary person.
I think Tom will permit us to do that.
I didn't even know we had practise.
A tornado is coming in.
That bird is called wagtail.
I'm listening to music.
He died in prison.
This seems to be a pretty busy place.
Don't worry about them. They're just jealous.
I think that Tom is the one who'll win.
Where did you meet them?
Don't worry about them. They're just jealous.
Cat!
I wouldn't work in Australia even if you paid me double.
Will you please tell me the secret?
She tried to conceal the fact.
Caution.
They saw him throw garbage into forest.
He is a mean fellow.
I doubt that I'll be successful this time.
Tom made me go.
I don't like this candy.
I fell asleep before the end of the movie.
You drink too much.
Sami wasn't a perfect person at that time.
Something always goes wrong.
Mary says she plans to do that.
Tom knew his plan wasn't very good.
I'll permit you to go.
There's a chance that Tom will eat with us tonight.
She is bored.
Is this wine good?
I've never seen Tom wearing a tie.
Here's another day in London.
Is it OK if I come?
I know that Tom is dead.
He will go to the dentist.
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston by yourself, is he?
How much money has Tom stolen?
Mary is going to get her chance.
How much is this T-shirt?
I must come in.
I'm going with Tom to Boston.
I am a boss.
Are these real?
Sorry! I'm not good at explaining.
We should give Tom a chance to tell us what really happened.
I've been working here for many decades.
I don't think Tom and Mary have ever seen one of these before.
Tom and Mary hoped they could do that.
Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't done it.
I can't wait to tell Tom about this.
Walk!
Halloween was brought to North America by immigrants from Europe who would celebrate the harvest around a bonfire, share ghost stories, sing, and tell fortunes.
Tom consumes a lot of wine.
You should've followed Tom's orders.
Now he has nothing to live for.
Tom said he'd be glad to help.
If I don't tell him, who will?
Did Tom get there in time?
The guy I met yesterday didn't give me his real name.
I'll never talk to you about my buddies again.
Algeria lacks water resources.
Sami wondered how the panties got there.
You should come too.
He took risks.
Tom said he can handle it.
Forget it.
I don't even want to talk to Tom.
Thank you!
How did your sister die?
I don’t think I’ll succeed.
Tom's world revolved around Mary.
He shaved his beard.
I saw Tom stealing something out of your purse.
I've got to phone Tom.
You said you needed me to help.
Sami can do whatever he wants to do with his life.
Oregon is just south of Washington.
Sami was trying to walk.
I think that Tom is going to be OK.
I'm pretty full.
How did Tom die?
Are these real?
Both teams are unbeaten.
I was hoping that you'd answer a few questions.
I was in London.
The burglar got away.
I read a book.
I don't have to move to Boston.
Right?
Tom said he thought that Mary understood French.
Read.
I'm not a doctor.
My mom was a wonderful woman.
I think that Tom doesn't really need to do that anymore.
Did you see how close that was?
Tom wondered where he might have put his passport.
Tom never wanted to do anything we asked him to do.
I haven't heard from him since last June.
Isn't that a friend of yours?
There is a mistake in the sentence.
Would you mind helping Tom and me?
I come from a small town located in Kabylie, Algeria.
He's very afraid of death.
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
Come in here a minute.
The aim of the Tatoeba project is the translation of all sentences into all languages, not to have a mass of sentences.
I didn't buy that.

How are you?
It looks like Tom won't be here today.
I know that Tom isn't in Boston.
Tom had no desire to win.
They cried when their dogs died.
Good.
We could stop somewhere.
Let me have a look at those photos.
Where did you buy that scarf?
If you put your mind to it, and you really want it, you can achieve it, whatever it is.
He knew me.
How old was Mary when she passed away?
Most people around here have no electricity.
She has to stop smoking.
I bought the TV from her.
Sami doesn't believe you.
Brains consume 25% of the body's energy.
Those are exactly what we want.
Mary is always late, isn't she?
Tom said that Mary was ready.
None of the books in my library are in French.
Tom has been living in Australia for a long time.
Tom is a really bad singer, isn't he?
He takes pride in his work.
I worry about that sometimes.
It belongs to me.
What time does the train arrive at Boston?
Do you have a match?
Tom came to pick me up at 2:30.
I go to school at eight o'clock.
I baked Tom some brownies.
Tom said that he hasn't yet done any of that.
Hi, I'm the King of the Universe.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
We appreciate your interest.
Behold.
Tom is awake.
Mary told me she bought a house in Boston.
500Gb?
Push off!
I think that's a small piece of sausage.
She waited for her lover at the station.
I can't communicate with Tom like I used to.
Tom said that Mary wasn't excited.
Tom said that I didn't look like a teacher.
Let's call her Taninna.
I saw Tom try to kiss you.
You should come as well.
It seems that there was a misunderstanding.
I want to learn how to say this word in Arabic.
We actually did that.
Tom was fired without notice.
I haven't told Tom about my financial problems.
Sometimes it's better to keep quiet.
Play!
Did Tom and Mary say where they found your wallet?
Tom has no right to give me orders.
Tom lives a quiet life.
Impossible!
He has twenty children.
I'll probably do exactly the same thing Tom does.
I am acquainted with the chairman of the committee.
I need somebody.
I moved to Australia last winter.
Mary's brother likes to dance.
What is the capital of Turkmenistan?
I don't think Tom knows anyone who's able to do that.
One day a man will fly to the stars.
I never really was on your side.
I know Tom needs to do that today.
Good to see you!
It's this month's magazine.
Pull over.
Is your mother at home now?
It's a good idea, but tell that to nature.
You're usually busier than me.
There's a good chance Tom will win the race.
I am fed up.
Tom worked all day long.
Tom and Mary promised me that they'd come.
Tom is a good reader.
Bravo!
Do you have a moment, Tom?

Can I talk to you about something that's bothering me?
Tom seems to know a lot about Boston.
Stop embarrassing me.
She rewrote it.
My brother advised me to stop smoking.
Sami brought me here to embarrass me.
I opened the can, but it was empty.
Tom is still a bartender, isn't he?
Tom was unbeatable.
This is my dog.
My stomach hurts.
I have two arms and ten fingers.
Tom hurt his leg while playing football.
Layla is dating Sami's brother.
He hung up his coat.
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
I must've made a mistake.
Tom didn't know that Mary had done that.
Do what you consider needed.
Careful!
I need you here now.
You don't seem to be interested in doing anything.
The police learned more about Sami's life.
Three people came.
Tom and Mary say they thought they could do that by themselves.
Let's drink something else.
Tom and Mary wanted to pay off their loan.
Mary is waiting for her husband to come home.
It was my first kiss.
They have a very spacious dining room.
Mary says she's thinking about moving to Boston.
At attention!
I can't even remember where I bought this.
Tom is difficult to deal with.
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
He has to pay for what he did.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
Can you play basketball well?
If you explain it, Tom ought to understand it.
I hope it'll be quiet.
Checkmate!
Do you play baseball?
I'm getting used to this new machine.
They took risks.
I forgot that today was Saturday.
I'm more than a friend.
The man who I thought was my friend deceived me.
He fries the eggs in oil.
"Are you making fun of me?" "No, I'm not."
Layla came back to her room.
Sami was the first person to start calling me "Fred."
You missed your chance.
Mary laughed when I told her about it.
She has twenty children.
I have a stomachache.
How are you?
Mary said she's already done that.
Layla wanted to leave.
Sickness changes people.
You can do that yourselves.
They're fishers.
Tom wears the same clothes that all his friends are wearing.
Tom won't likely tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
Is the pain unbearable?
I can't believe Tom doesn't like Mary.
Do you promise never to lie again?
Do you see the stars?
Let's talk to him.
They cooked all their own meals.
I'll buy you a coffee at the cafeteria.
That's interesting, but beside the point.
What is this?
Is Tom allergic to anything?
Quickly!
Mary wouldn't tell anyone, would she?
I broke one of your mugs.
Come with us now.
I don't know your reasons for not liking Tom.
Do you sell advance tickets here?
Tom talks about Mary all the time.
What did you do this morning?
You are my pride and joy.
Boston wasn't cold when I was there.
Do you see that happening again?
I thought Tom and Mary weren't busy.
I will check it.
Don't worry about the past.
Many people lack humility.
Tom has been working since late last night.
I just bought myself a new jacket.
Sami was so skinny.
Tom complained that Mary never helped him.
Try to learn some grammar.
Do I owe you money?
She was born yesterday.
She put her harmonica in her pocket.
I have too much homework.
"May I help you?" "Yes, I'm looking for a dress."
Sami was respected by everyone.
How much time will you be in Australia?
Sad.
We kiss our child a hundred times a day.
You're going to start right now.
You're my star, Sami.
I didn't ask Tom to sing.
Sami has an issue with you.
Nothing will ever change that.
Are you going to go talk to Tom?
What's the message?
Tom, you should come too.
Tom put a finger to his lips.
In 2013, Tom relocated to Boston.
Tom and Mary always blame John for everything.
Mary made her position clear.
You know what this is, don't you?
It is raining.
Harry couldn't keep up with the class.
Tom is going to put his house up for sale.
He is not going to be cold.
I knew Tom wouldn't be afraid.
Tom and Mary wanted to protect themselves.
Learn!
Hey.
Do you know where my key is?
I hope you'll remember this in the future.
I didn't buy that.
I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.
This is something I made.
I worked late last night.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
Sami was tracking Layla on Facebook.
A book worth reading is worth reading twice.
Why is grass green?
There's a bus stop neighbouring our school.
I know Tom doesn't want to be there.
I'll be with you every step of the way.
Escape!
Tom and Mary say they have a lot to do today.
Tom cried for an hour.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
Can you please tell me what's happening?
I translate only for my manager.
Tom crammed everything into his suitcase.
Sami is not here to make friends.
Thanks for your advice.
Why don't you let Tom know you aren't going to do that?
Mary usually goes to school by bus, but sometimes she walks.
Rest.
I know you'll enjoy Australia.
I saw you crying.
It might take years.
Sami doesn't live on a farm.
What're Tom and Mary going to do when they finish school?
I should go to the city to talk to him.
Great expectations.
That's the way I would've done that.
Mary said she didn't need your permission to do that.
Did Tom speak French to you?
Nobody's ever asked me that question before.
Is it all right if I come in?
Tell Tom I feel fine.
Flee!
They're still alive.
I wanted to become a doctor.
This is a secret.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Sami and Farid are like best friends.
It was nice to meet you.
It was a summer day.
Who gave you that envelope?
Heaving a great sigh I plunk my bread on the table and flump onto the chair.
I'd like to swim in this river.
This is the best book I've ever read.
Maryland is the richest state in the United States.
Inhale.
I'm pretty sure they won't allow us to do that.
Why did you live in Boston last year?
Tom barely escaped.
You don't need my approval.
Are you listening to me?
I didn't realize that Tom and Mary wanted me to do that for them.
If I were you, I'd think twice before going on that route.
Cool!
The river is about half as long again as the Thames.
Mary has lots of things she wants to do today.
Tom is going to ask Mary to do that for John.
I doubt I’ll be successful this time.
Tom came to my rescue.
The storm has caused terrible damage.
I translated.
How much is she paying you?
The whole world could be destroyed by an atomic war.
Tom wanted to live in Australia with his family.
I have met him before.
Tom is going to eventually learn how to do that.
They are all ears.
He wants to know everything.
Sami waited for his mom to come home.
She rose slowly to her feet.
I was blinded by the bright sun.
Mary said she was asked to help.
Even though I slept for twelve hours, I'm still sleepy.
He eats nothing but fruit.
All right.
I have something in my eye.
Mary hasn't told me where she's planning to stay.
Tom came here today looking for trouble.
I hope you'll return.
Tom has a mustache.
Let's ask for it.
How did you find out about us?
They are reading their book.
That's what usually happens.
I don't like all of them.
It's easy for Alberto to learn.
Thank you for waiting.
We should probably get you to a doctor.
I hope Tom isn't tired.
Can you really blame him?
I'd love to have breakfast with you.
Could you please turn the radio on?
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in Australia?
I don't think Tom and Mary know you're here.
He returned very late at night.
You won't believe what I have found today.
Will Algeria change?
They plan to have a party.
Our government doesn't care about us.
I spend a lot of time studying French.
I hope that Mary likes the present I bought for her.
I'll be here waiting for you at 2:30.
I don't know what I should say.
"Well, there's something I'd like your advice on about my research project ..." "Let's see... Hmm, you're investigating flowering plants then."
Shouting isn't singing.
What would I do without you?
We were the ones who did that.
I dream of a society whose wealth is distributed fairly.
Do you know where my key is?
She slammed her hands on the table.
Tom looks like he's bored.
Allow me to explain.
Mary said she didn't live in Boston anymore.
This is the guitar I like the best.
"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
Ashgabat is Turkmenistan's capital.
You should keep in touch with Tom.
My wife is a vegetarian.
Whose friend are you?
Is Tom the only one who knows how to do that?
Of course this is my real family name. Here's my passport.
She moved back in with her parents.
She's painting her nails.
I gave him three textbooks in exchange for his help.
Mary looked like she was guilty.
Thank you for waiting.
She slipped and hit her head.
Wait.
Mary left her keys on the table.
I didn't realize Tom was busy.
What would you do in my place?
How much time do you spend getting ready for work every day?
Ready!
Tom had problems at school.
It's sometimes difficult to do away with misunderstandings.
Every student is supposed to know the school regulations.
I don't want to go to school.
They told me that they were very happy.
After having walked six kilometers, he felt tired.
I'm the one who told Mary that she should study French.
My uncle gave me some good advice when I was in trouble.
I knew it was them.
He wished he had more free time.
Sorry...
Tom says I have to study French.
Tom agreed not to do that.
I love you like crazy.
I'm sorry you're sick.
Maybe it's Fadil.
Sami played.
I wanted to pay closer attention.
We made sure of it.
Once I helped her.
Hmm.
You still haven't met your girlfriends parents?
Mary said she'd take care of it.
Did you get a massage?
I don't want to be left here in the dark.
My baby began crying, asking for milk.
Which do you think have more vitamin C, apples or grapes?
Proceed!
Don't you think it's wrong to cheat on an examination?
You want to be finished doing that by 2:30, don't you?
I don't want meat.
I advise you in my capacity as a doctor to stop smoking.
Put the bag down.
He spreads gossip.
You encouraged us to do that.
She's a fisher.
Tom and Mary kept their eyes shut.
Sami stole the phone from a store.
Is that the real reason that you don't like Tom?
Tom doesn't have to do that alone.
Why do I need to go to Australia?
Do you know where my glasses are?
He shut his notebook.
Please make your bed.
It belongs to me.
I forgot my suitcase.
Sing!
The exam was very hard, and I couldn't answer a single question.
Mary said that she wanted to move to Boston.
Sickness changes people.
Tom is going to join us shortly.
I know you'll enjoy Australia.
Are you sure it'll be OK?
What beautiful weather!
He was seen to throw garbage into forest.
Sami was eating by himself.
Don't be scared.
How dare you marry my daughter without my consent?
Tom is very young.
Words could not describe it.
Hand me the water carafe.
Tom took his key out of his pocket and unlocked the door.
She's teaching students English.
Judging by his look, he looks like a beggar.
They know that I'm older than them.
Nature never breaks its own laws.
These are too small for you.
Can we come tomorrow?
He walked towards his car.
What for?
They were here earlier, weren't they?
It isn't a fake.
Tom realized he wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
The girl in the picture is smiling.
I should have guessed Tom would do something like this.
You lost your glasses.
I didn't think Tom would enjoy Mary's concert.
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston for three years.
Tom was my boyfriend three years ago.
That is unconfirmed information.
Mary ate the apple Tom gave her.
Do you promise never to lie again?
Tom worked all day long.
You can make your choice freely without fear of retribution.
He helped you, didn't he?
Tom went out drinking almost every night when he was in Boston.
She bought her dream house.
I want to know whether or not you'll be ready by 2:30.
Tom came into the room without knocking on the door.
No one could make the princess laugh.
I could barely breathe.
You could feel how the earth trembled.
I had no idea you'd ever met Tom.
Do you plan to stay in Australia for very long?
It happened before.
Fadil gave a full confession of what happened.
Where are the friends?
I tried to explain that to Tom.
That goes against my beliefs.
Patience!
How wings help birds fly?
We made sure of it.
Did he tell you?
I cannot make noise. The baby is sleeping.
It's boring to stay at home.
Hail, Caesar!
Are your parents still living?
I saw what happened.
You have to speak French here.
Tom didn't know that Mary had done that.
I want to sit in your place.
Layla was sixteen years old when she put on hijab.
Layla doesn't celebrate birthdays.
Mary asked Tom to give her a ride home.
Isn't that a friend of yours?
You don't eat anything.
My son is taller than I am.
You take things too much to heart, Anne.
It's totally wrong.
I'm the one who made this.
Boring!
I heard my name called by someone.
Where do you think I should pitch my tent?
I'm scared to get closer to your dog.
Home!
I don't think that's appropriate.
Tom earns more than $10,000 per year.
Do you like books written by Franz Kafka?
Is there anything you want to say?
They're studying in their rooms.
Tom and Mary may have some problems we can help them deal with.
We can understand everything she's saying.
You have the same answer to everything.
You don't really want to live there, do you?
I think I could've done that by myself.
Tom often drives too fast.
Retire.
I will make it clear for her, just in case.
Aren't you going to be on vacation next week?
Is there any place around here where I can rent a bicycle?
Tom is a student at Harvard, isn't he?
I hope Tom isn't tired.
If you are to succeed, you must make a good start.
What's the name of this tree?
Likewise.
On a clear, dark night, our eyes can see about 6,000 or so stars in the sky.
I want to get up and dance.
She wasn't so sure herself.
Tom and Mary are here, but they're busy at the moment.
There's a book lying open on the desk.
Have you found your ticket yet?
Mary won't let us help her.
He didn't even respond with one word.
No one knew what to do.
Interesting.
Tom was living with us at that time.
I didn't count on anything else.
It looks like Tom and Mary aren't interested in that.
You should buy your ticket in advance.
Tom and Mary don't eat anything except the vegetables that they grow themselves.
Tom teaches at three different schools.
I think that Tom can help Mary.
Stop brooding.
I know why Tom and Mary were crying.
Today is not good for me.
It's about thirty minutes from here on foot.
I want you to do it alone.
Life's unfair.
I'm an idler.
Tom didn't even try to get out of the way.
I've seen a lot of changes here.
I never should've listened to you.
I don't think that Tom will do that today.
I can't come tonight.
Take our picture.
I won't have time on Monday nor on Tuesday.
They seldom forget to pay their rent.
Tell me what should be done.
Tom got awfully sick and had to go home.
Journalists collect information with the goal of providing the most accurate version of events.
Don't stand up.
Your website looks good.
What team do you cheer for?
I didn't think doing that would be much fun.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be here later.
Tom has a problem and he wants to solve it.
I didn't spend a penny.
Do you want coffee?
Today's my daughter's birthday.
Tom shouldn't do that kind of thing by himself.
You're a lot smarter than you think.
Tom came downstairs in his pajamas.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.
Really!
Is this door always locked?
Mary wanted to learn how to defend herself.
Do you want to come out and play?
I feel alone. That's why I have so many friends on Facebook.
She knew she'd win.
The flowers were bright and colourful.
Tom has a teenage daughter.
Sami and Layla's honeymoon is over.
Can't anyone else come?
Sami didn't worry about Layla.
Tom's dog has black and white spots.
Thanks for your advice.
I don't want to eat.
Time flies fast.
It is said that she is ill.
I wrote Tom three letters last month.
How long do frogs live?
Does she speak English?
He has to speak French for his job.
It had all been a big mistake.
Is the skirt not too short?
Tom unscrewed the cap and handed the jar to Mary.
I wrote you ten letters.
I saw Tom yesterday morning.
Malbrough is going to war.
Tom thinks his parents are perfect.
Masaru gets married today.
Do you know the reason why Tom was late?
Think about it one more time.
A woman is the most sweet thing in the world.
I'm listening to music.
How long do frogs live?
Find Mary and tell her to come here right away.
I've got a fever.
I think you know that Tom isn't going to be here today.
I thought that you might like something to drink.
I wouldn't have visited Boston if Tom hadn't told me to.
She looks older than she is.
We call him Mike.
By the time the ambulance arrived, Tom was already dead.
Maybe Tom will give me a job.
Tom and Mary have done everything they wanted to do.
Mary went to the hospital because she was sick.
She hurried to the station only to miss the train.
You're quite right.
They are talking to each other.
Get your clothes on.
Nay.
The revolution has brought about many changes.
Welcome home.
You look much better.
Martians have taken over the earth.
I've never forgotten Tom's birthday.
They don't eat.
She has a scar on her chin.
Tom wants to read a book.
He has scars all over his body.
Are you listening to me?
I don't always do that that way.
Tom identified Mary's body at the morgue.
It's just not what I do.
My legs ache from sitting.
Please tell Tom and Mary they have to get home before 2:30.
I told you I'd help you.
They have a very spacious dining room.
This is a book about England.
He isn't sure if he's right.
We want to make learning effective, interesting, and fascinating.
I didn't know you were a romantic.
Tom asked me to come back tomorrow.
When was the last time you cut your nails?
I heard my name called by someone.
You're gonna make me furious!
The meat's not ready yet.
What is it, dear?
Tell us what needs to be done.
Play there.
I think Tom didn't believe me.
Be our guest.
This is my daughter.
Don't you want to know what Tom looks like?
Tom was important to me.
Mary looks like she's ready to work.
Tom and Mary would've done that by themselves if John hadn't helped them.
Tom became a teacher.
He came into the hospital to visit me.
Mary is quite crazy, isn't she?
Tom said I needed to get more sleep.
Why do you work here?
Do you want a job?
Drink!
Did you just call me old?
Why didn't you go to Boston?
She's pretty, but dangerous.
Louder.
He buttered his toast.
I didn't think Tom would tell you how to do that.
Jump.
You can identify children's voices without any problem.
He saved the boy from drowning.
Tom can't swim at all.
Dead?
I want you to keep away from her.
We warned you.
They can't shout, they are dead men long ago.
Maybe Mary doesn't know she shouldn't do that.
I don't think Tom and Mary are the people you should be talking to.
Dunno.
I've decided to tell Mary that I love her.
Many people lost their homes after the earthquake.
Cool!
And whose fault is that?
Tom buried his face in his hands.
Aren't you going to the game?
Morning!
You should not be afraid of the future.
They are reading.
The bird is in heaven.
Mary didn't hurt anyone, did she?
Sami is not doing that.
Tom and Mary are the only ones here who know John.
Tom came to Australia to look for a job.
My answer matches yours.
And who's going to stop us?
He translates faster than others read.
There are security cameras all around here.
We need to eat something.
What are you doing to achieve your goals?
Tom and Mary say they don't have time to do that.
Jim likes the doctor.
Tom is on the same team as you, isn't he?
Write with pen and ink.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
Tom isn't able to do that tonight.
She taught her children French.
Sami didn't even look over there.
Sami started washing his hands.
Is it true that you built this house by yourself?
I think you're too sick to go to school.
Tom searched for a job online.
Mary walked in and quietly closed the door behind her.
How many times an hour do Tom and Mary do that?
I will make it clear for him, just in case.
Where did she try doing that?
I won't betray Tom.
Tom and Mary told me they'd visit Boston.
Pick up your things and go away.
Stars twinkled in the sky.
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow.
Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I need to do that.
You're bored.
What are you doing out here in the cold?
Congratulations!
Tom asked if I wanted to go to a party and I said yes.
My husband makes a hundred thousand dollars a year.
Tom and Mary think I don't know what happened.
No one will give us any money.
Layla thought it was the perfect plan.
I don't understand why Tom didn't want us there.
Tom is considered dangerous.
Tom didn't seem very satisfied.
You must give it to them.
Tom gave me an apple.
Tom and Mary used the money John gave them to buy something to eat.
What did you say?
What is three times seven?
Do Tom and Mary still have keys?
Action!
I don't have a hundred dollars.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
She spreads gossip.
Thanks for waiting.
I'm sure Mary is gravely ill.
He went to Gokdepe.
Tomorrow is the wedding. Everyone needs to look very festive.
I thought it was a good idea.
He lives in the city.
The Second World War was five times bloodier than the First.
Every member must attend.
Sami started dancing with the teacher.
Tom is very loyal to his friends.
Grandma walked to the market to buy food for the whole family.
A good person is a moral person.
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
I say go for it.
Tom is the one who turned on the lights.
I bought the car at a 10% discount.
He was elected captain of the team.
I think I'm going to go inside.
Mary thinks she's infallible.
I sure do miss Tom.
I have a dream.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
He hates snakes.
Tom will likely do that, won't he?
We won't need money.
Breathe.
Sami can help you with this.
She speaks English very well.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think John really knew how to do that.
Who do you think is the GOAT of tennis?
Do you have a cat?
Tom glanced at the others.
Tom was lying when he said he didn't know Mary.
Just say nothing.
I'm too tired tonight.
I think everybody should learn another language.
Hold on.
I assure you that we care.
I really want you to meet them.
Mary found what she was looking for under the table.
Do you know what Tom looks like?
Which do you like better, bananas or apples?
I wonder what effect technical advances such as the Internet, mobile phones and digitalization technology have on the people's awareness, actions and interest in politics.
Hello?
Sami is going outside.
Tom says he has to go to Australia the day after tomorrow.
They learned.
I forgot to feed the fish.
