You must be a fool.
Tom is in the park.

Take her somewhere.
I was right on the spot when it happened.
Its origin is unknown.
Smell this.

Where did you see it?
I don't know why you want me to do that.
I expect that I will see him on Monday.

What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very angry.
As is often the case, Mike was late for the meeting this afternoon.
Tom told me that Mary had a new boyfriend.
We're not going to let that happen.
These fools broke the law that forbade breaking the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke in such a loud voice that I could hear him upstairs.
Tom got his eyes tested.
I didn't give it to Tom.
Strange rumors are going around.
I know that you are rich.
Bill put aside a hundred dollars for his trip.
He served in the navy.
Who taught you how to dance?

It wouldn't surprise me.
Seriously, I’m not lying.

Tell Tom everything that happened here.
I am looking for my phone.

Everyone but Tom is wearing a hat.
She gives him everything he asks for.
Is that for sale?
I'm getting angrier.
Do you have a bigger one?
This is legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
That only makes the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the toilet being flushed.
I rang the doorbell.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can I use your car for a little while?
You can't stay in here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There is a little sugar in the bag.
I used to do that as a kid.
A very good thing happened today.
What are you guys talking about?
Don't meddle in other people's affairs.
Who's wearing the blue T-shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I have no money to buy the dictionary with.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for the eyesight.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I had known her address, I would have written her a letter.

His house is beyond the hill.
It was Sunday and I wasn't about to get up early.
What a lot of pens!
Mary, are you decent?
I've corrected the mistake.
Do you want me to call them?
Tom did twenty pushups.
I'm sure you'll be able to do the job.
You could've heard a pin drop in the restaurant after Mary slapped Tom in the face, threw a glass of wine over him and stomped out.
You are two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary in private.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, who is in prison, never writes to Tom.
This is expensive.
I haven't heard from him for ages.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought it was about time we all met.
All are interested in Japan.

Please just do everything I do.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what you call good luck.
It was so dark I had to feel my way around the room.

Is she your teacher?
Sing it again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom understands he's no longer needed.
Tom was in the garden.
The young plants are potted during the winter.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom must've told Mary.
Why's everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you that would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
What time do you wake up?
Take the garbage out.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I've got her keys.
You bought candles, didn't you?
Canada is the motherland of ice hockey.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They would agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief snuck in through the window.
Spiders are loathsome little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
A kiss without a mustache is like a bowl of soup with no salt.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
Today, many things happened.
I saw a car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom was working with Mary.
I'm awfully tired.
Do you know what your children are doing right now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We saw a castle ahead of us.
Tom continued to tickle her.
Six comes before seven.
I went to visit my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe that someone wanted to kill him.

You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom is getting a little tipsy.

I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one equals two.
Red is better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not yet ready to do that.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you want to say?

Stop making so much noise.

Try to convince her to help us.
Are you going to go with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
Wood may remain ten years in the water, but it will never become a crocodile.
Tom pretended not to understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw that happen.
I think it can be no other reason but that.
I'm really happy now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
Sign here.
What an ego!
Does that mean you bought it?
A man is as old as he feels and a woman as old as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you said to me?
Last year there was a lot of snow.
He attempted to swim across the river.
Everybody seems to be happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
Don't you want to have another daughter?

What happened to your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm OK.
We're not going to fire you.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend such a large amount of money?
Mary likes to hang out with the bad boys.

Watch your mouth or you'll get it.
You need to consider the consequences before making any modifications to existing code.
I cannot bite. I have no teeth.
I think you did great.
We had a heavy rain last night.
What did Tom bring?
This is exactly what I've been looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I injured my ankle.
I have nothing more to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She sat in a chair reading a magazine.
From this moment on it is forbidden to cry.
If I'd known it, I'd have told you.
Here is the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the monkey.
Don't you even think of eating my chocolate!
Painted white, this house looks bigger.
I had some trouble finding the original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point in doing that?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me Tom speaks French.
Tom is coming back to Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll have dinner.
I think Tom played well.
He only blames other people, and never himself.
Do you know how to play the banjo?
Tom walked over to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
How long does a turtle live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years finish building my house.
I was irked.
Don't talk to your mother like that!
We're going to see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us at his party.
I suddenly realized what was happening.
She said she'd be late.
Do your parents still live in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom is very likely to win.
What would you like Santa to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventure?
Why were you angry with me?
You may leave if you want to.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
The cat is not mine.
The captain ordered his men to fire.
Sit there.
He hasn't made it yet.
Tom is a father now.
Tom is engaged to my daughter.
I will not go to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman. One must think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I didn't succeed.
I thought that you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
It sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you wear a hat.
Put it on the shelf.
I thought you'd found someone else.
There are always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
Do you think such a thing is possible?
To make things even worse, he got sick.
Do you think Tom is unsociable?
If that's true, then she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom didn't seem to recognize you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Keep it to yourself.
Do you read something besides the Bible?
Give me a reading on that meter near the boiler.
What does that gentleman do for a living?
Why do you think Tom likes it?
Do your parents know about this?
Are they talking about you?
Tom wants you in the conference room.
The main thing on Tatoeba is not to utter ideas above your stomach and below your knees.
He paid him four dollars.

What are the lyrics to that song?
Mary likes teasing her brother.
Law is on my side.
Tom needed to find someplace to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
Publication of the article was timed to coincide with the professor's birthday.
Your phone rang several times while you were in the shower.
She married him for his money.
Not every bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think that Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
That's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
The bill, please.
You must keep your shoes clean.
Your birthday's coming up.
Do the math.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded from the Internet.
I think Tom is under thirty.
Were you drinking?
He is, without question, the best man for the job.
You make my job easy.
Tom said that he saw Mary doing that.
Tom can't just quit.
I'm loved.
You don't seem very busy.
The deadline has passed.
You're a lot like me.
Do you know those men over there?
Tom left the room without saying a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished your lunch yet?
Tom and Mary talked for at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you push this button, the door will open.
How many ties do you need?
I came back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the latest rumours?
I would've shown you how to do that.
I begged Tom to come.
Your tag is sticking out.
My mother taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He kept a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I screamed for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know that this is important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I won't be late again.
I am terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom tends to the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if you kill them.
They've taken Tom off life support.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Pardon my French.
What did I just do?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other everything.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom is half your age.
Tom shut the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be recovered from radioactive waste material.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you tell Tom first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He would not dare to do such a thing.
The twelve-hour journey had tired me out.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom had breakfast.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know that Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help Tom wash windows?
That's outside my area of expertise.
It was yesterday.
I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
What does your son want to be when he grows up?
I'm unnecessary here.
Don't tell Tom what really happened.
I'm not just going to give it to you.
What will you say then?
Were you speaking about your hobbies?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?

She married him at the age of 20.
I cannot give this dictionary to anyone.
Hand me that box.

Do your children know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup smacks of fish.
There are a lot of girls in the room.
He talks about her too much.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know that I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were buying time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ while living among people spoke in a terrible, from the point of view of the Jews, Galilean dialect of Aramaic language instead of Hebrew; thereby showing the inconsistency of the allegations of the existence of any sacred language, which claim the use of such in prayers especially brings the followers closer to God.
Tom eventually changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom was paid three hundred dollars for doing that.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast was right.
It's obvious Tom doesn't know anything.
I'll ask Tom to make you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I have no other books.
I want you to read this book.

That's really hard.
You've betrayed me.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
Is that my book?
Laundry is a chore.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my number.
I've already decided who to go with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's children must miss him.
I thought Tom was mistaken.
I think you should talk to them.
He read physics at Oxford.
He concealed the fact from me.
Are you the one who saved me?
While sleeping, he snored loudly.
Which browser is your favorite?

You don't even look at me.
Tom is too lazy to do that.
Please cease from quarreling.
Grandpa always said there'd be days like this.
That's not what I told her.

Somebody's got to talk to him.
I never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You sound upset.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will do you a lot of good.
Tell Tom to be here by 2:30.
It's not rocket science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Do you want to drink some beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of starvation.
I've learned so much from my mistakes, I'm thinking of making a few more!!

How wonderful is that?
I'm hungover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car sells well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words confused me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Give my love to her.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer stunned everyone.
Tom looks well.
Did you kiss Tom back?
It's about time I was going.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I'm a light sleeper.
Tom doesn't care about anyone but himself.
I am from Shizuoka.
Tom cut down all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day when he is free.
I wonder what has become of her.

He gave him the book.
Thanks very much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
It's as easy as falling off a log.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm satisfied with the way things are.

What is it you want to talk about?
Tom is shouting at Mary.
That's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine running.
I do not know what is in the box.
I thought Tom said that Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October of 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Again and again there are challenges in our life. Some call them problems, others call them growth opportunities.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.

I knew I could rely on you!
Tom added wood to the fire.
"Love has never killed anyone." "Really? Ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I've bought everything I was planning to buy.
That looks like the work of a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.

Are you hurt anywhere?
He could not go on a trip for lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll knock it down!

That was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone left me uneasy.
The river flows calmly.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I was watching them.
Do you really love her?

It was dark green.
He'll come for sure.
Is there a message?
Yesterday, I got a call out of the blue from Tom.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all of your questions.
I'll bring the glasses.
I've decided to give up.

We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.

I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his stove.
My eyes hurt.
I like stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, OK?
Tom tossed Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I cannot help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the combination of royal authority and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
Do you want me to go talk to Tom myself?
We each went to our respective homes.

I don't know what I want right now.
This is unbelievable.

Six to five for the viewers!
I think she is a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.

He looks terrific.
Tom will help you if you ask him to.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I was ugly.
Do you cry often?
We didn't expect these results.
I've already read it.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Have you found something interesting?
Everyone does it.

I heard this sentence on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her shoulder.
Can't you speak French?
How dare you do this!
This knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?

It's a situation I would love to change.
We've taken care of everything.

There's no escape for her.
I'm sorry that I did that without you.
Your nose is bleeding.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Soon your efforts will be rewarded.
Tom wants the same thing you do.
We can't just ignore this.
Where did you and Tom first meet?
Where's there a supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you sing out of tune, join us.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I cannot swim.
He never existed.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It had never happened before.
I wasn't about to do that.
I can't trust you.

Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom isn't leaving.

What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
No one loves me.
I wish I knew Tom's telephone number.

The teacher put a short comment on each paper.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of that tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix this.
I said let them go.
When does it start?
No one cares what she thinks.
I don't think it's strange at all.
"How did you get my phone number?" "Tom gave it to me."
When will you harvest your wheat?
Tom told Mary that he was ready to do that.
Does it make sense to fix this?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said that he's tried doing that three times.
He thinks that I am in love with her.

This lesson is never-ending!
This box weighs a ton. What's inside?
He gets everything because he's a brown-noser.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

It looked like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you enjoying yourself?
That's not very likely to happen.
I'll order that later.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to Boston?
This school is ours.
I was free all day yesterday, but today I'm working.
Take your coat. It's cold today.
Come to think of it, I really need a cellphone.

Please do something about it.
As you know, we were late due to the heavy rain.
To all appearances, she is healthy.

Look after your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to wind up.
Have you eaten supper yet?
I love chili.

Why are you wearing my shoes?
The power rests with Tom.
I learned to study and play like my Japanese friends.
Why are you looking at me?
Nobody's going to blame you.
I'm not at all busy now.
Children like playing more than studying.
He was mistaken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.

Tom hopes Mary knows that she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We're proud of our achievement.
Tom should've invited Mary.
Tom should've been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread that I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She has become a postwoman.
Don't leave me alone here.
I need to know everything.
We need a taxi.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that that man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as “Harald Bluetooth", introduced Christianity to Denmark.
We can do nothing for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?

I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He put on the black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.

Another day gone by.
You should do that right now.
I have to go and have an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He hurt himself upon falling.
We're unbiased.

I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Do you come from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world-famous for its hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like this perfume?
The lock is broken.
The diamond is a precious stone.
Help yourself to the cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Hold up there, sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom has promised to go to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he got married to a very beautiful actress.
Did you have a good sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They mean well.
Tom works as a waiter.
It'll be cold this evening.
She says that she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice, waiting for a reply, was faced with was a sudden howl. It was a resounding noise, sharp as to burst her ear drums, loud as to reach unto the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We had been talking about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know that you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom isn't allowed to go there.
Tom helped Mary carry stuff out to her car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know that what I did was wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We should hire him.
I tried in vain to deal with the problem.
You ought to have done the homework.
I talked on the phone.
I don't think that Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I could not lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
What goes around comes around.
We rented a canoe.
Have you eaten a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers was your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes despise the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed up a tree.
The language I'm learning is very hard.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know that I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have a firm belief in his innocence.
The president governs for four years.
I'm glad you're glad.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Could you solve the problem?
Tom and Mary are both here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building has twenty floors.
If you don't go, I won't, either.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
Are you going to give Tom anything for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to assist Mary.
She likes the singer.
If he had taken my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision on my own.
Can you say that one more time?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind arose.
Tom didn't have the courage to try sky diving.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Do you feel OK?
He is stubborn as a mule.
I think you're reliable.
She knew she was wrong.
It's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's defensive.
You are always wrong.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me that she'd won.
We should stick to our plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with his children.
How are the negotiations going?
He prepared himself for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would find it interesting.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom has a little mustache.
Did you understand what she said?
You seem distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a bright idea.
She is resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said that he wouldn't help me.
Why do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything's all right.
She always keeps her room in good order.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on other people's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face got red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're finished already.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
For him, hunger was an abstract concept. He had always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Somebody poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
He looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her feet ached.
It's a risk we can't afford to take.
Can you spare a minute? I'd like to discuss something of importance to both of us.
We've got to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of 2?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that a lot.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
It'll be opening time, time I get down there.
I'm not sure what size she wears.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
Tom turned on his flashlight and went into the cave.
Who is your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as it stops raining.
Tom stepped away from the door.
We have to do that.
She could not help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
He and I cried.
Don't you want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you so dressed up?
Milk can be made into butter, cheese, and many other things.
You have no authority to do that.
I've got a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, do not forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourselves.
You like jazz, don't you?
You are drunk!
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.

Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve that problem.

You promised that you wouldn't drink today.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We have checked.

We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
This is definitely not what I wanted.
How did you fracture your shoulder?
Tom concealed the fact that he had been in prison.

I don't have any male siblings.
Let's watch something else.
Do you think that this translation is accurate?
I know that Tom kissed Mary.
We were both very hungry.
Tom has nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Pull over here.
That was a big help.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You must take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, go to sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have the time.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going out for a meal on Friday.

I wasn't ready for this.
Look at that girl.

His neck is broken.
What are you saying?
You left the bar last night just when I was about to buy everyone another round.

I ache all over.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They are running.
The road is inadequate for the amount of traffic which it carries.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.

I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of his former self.
How do we do it?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go to Boston with us next week.
Don't let them in.
Anything can happen.
What day is it today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me for who I am.
I'm a normal guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.

I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stand still!
What is your favorite TV program?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh my God! It's on fire!
I am afraid that you will get lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I will come back to Canada tomorrow.
Give my thanks to your son.
It seems that his father is a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What are you talking about?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to drop by his house this afternoon.
They need you.
This is an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what's happened?

Tom will never find it.
In any case, now I'm considering trying out some likely things.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is the first time I've ever grilled meat in my home.

How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom became very famous quickly.
Everybody already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.
You don't have to lie.

I already knew that.
I never met Tom.
She may have said so.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.

Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I was thinking of.
Tom showed his driver's license to the policeman.
I get a haircut every month.

I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There are many talented people in our city, but Tom isn't one of them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
I found my bicycle gone.
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
I doubt that Tom will win.
"Gee, it sure is boring around here." "My boy, this peace is what all—" "Here I come! Your Majesty, Ganon and his minions have seized the island of Koridai." "Hmm. How can we—" "It is written: only Link can defeat Ganon." "So how can we—" "Great! I'll grab my sword!" "There is no sword." "Huh?" "There is no sword!" "..." "Here is a skull axe." "No." "How about an oh-my-goodness spear?" "No." "How about smoke bombs?" "No." "Well damn, how about this pistol?" "Yeah!"

Is your watch right?
See you Sunday at three.
I was at your wedding.

Pray for us.

I'm beginning to think you're serious.
I won't come back again.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
This is Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do things like this?
Tom is really sorry.
I like your glasses.

Have you taken your medicine?
Bunnies are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time's on our side.
Don't you know him?
I am still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt that Tom is still angry.

We'll take her home.
Do you smell rubber burning?
That's not what happened here.

Who sent you?

Put it on the floor.
I wish I could have gone with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
Do you plan to stay long?
We ate a hasty meal and left immediately.
There is a large garden at the back of his house.
You're obstinate.
Be careful not to drop anything on your feet.
Begin every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you ever call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The gate was open.
I brought some wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you all.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.

This is the book that you are looking for, isn't it?
It had to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is this water drinkable?

Do you live there?
What would you like to eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask whether Tom was planning on doing that or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to go to his birthday party.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing a new pair of shoes.

Naivete is his only merit.
My hobby is collecting insects.

Always yield to traffic from the right.

There are a few more questions I'd like to ask you.
I do not like the rain.
She may be cute, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you like.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Are you still having trouble with that?
I never asked her.
There is nothing as relaxing as lying in a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a book lying open on the desk.
Sorry, I had completely forgotten about it.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
She is my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like siren's song to me.

Treat him well.
Tom wants to borrow my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?

For Christ's sake, stop it!

There's a bottle in the refrigerator.
I still can't believe Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't say when he'd be here.
Tom really likes you.
Can you do that for me?
There's not much I can do for you now.
It's because I was asked to come that I'm here.

What if he's wrong?
Tom is a little bit like his father.

They have taken her away.
Mary could do it if she tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one, too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?

Today, I'm finally going to tell Tom what I really think of him.
Don't get mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
You like to sing?
I love winter.
Show me her picture.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom certainly doesn't think so.
I got a phone call from him just as I was about to go to bed.
If I can do that, so can you.
He felt the warmth of the sun on his skin.
Tom promised to return.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
