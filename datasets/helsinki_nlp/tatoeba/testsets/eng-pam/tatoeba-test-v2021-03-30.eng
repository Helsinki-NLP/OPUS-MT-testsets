He is a mere child. 
It looks like Tom was right. 
Stay with Tom for a moment. 
Would you like something to drink? 
We looked down at the beautiful sea. 
I thought you were serious. 
I pointed this out to her. 
Do you like to travel? 
I would like to buy some aspirin. 
It is said that nobody has solved the problem yet. 
Don't let him keep this picture. 
Tom wouldn't do what I asked him to do. 
When do you usually eat lunch? 
Should I call the doctor? 
Do you drink? 
Everybody got scared. 
They aren't dead. 
Shit stinks. 
I'll write to Tom. 
He went out of the room without being noticed by anyone. 
I'll tell her you came by. 
Don't get lost. 
She decided to be a doctor. 
I have to wake Tom up soon. 
The earth is a ball. 
Do you eat meat? 
Tom doesn't like me very much. 
Do whatever's required. 
Please close the door. 
I'm sure this is only temporary. 
Hide that book. 
I know you are rich. 
Nobody called him. 
They captured Tom. 
They might be able to help you. 
Are you ready? 
This is Mary's dog. 
He was blind from birth. 
I'm taking notes. 
Tom wanted to stick around for a few more days. 
He plays very well. 
He plays the piano very well. 
Are we doing this? 
I didn't know Tom lived in Boston. 
I am more beautiful than you. 
The bridge is high. 
Tom is deaf in one ear. 
How to say it? 
Can I help you? 
Tom probably won't even notice that Mary isn't here. 
That was unrealistic. 
You are ill. 
Where do you think all the money goes? 
I will have him call you the moment he gets back. 
Didn't you see Tom at the party? 
You've told me that before. 
I'm at home. 
This car runs on alcohol. 
They both smiled. 
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders. 
Try this! 
It doesn't surprise me. 
Tom peeked out the door to see what was happening. 
Like father, like son. 
What do you like about it? 
Tom came in and handed Mary an envelope. 
Are you going to do that again? 
We went to New York by plane. 
Workers lost their jobs. 
I love a woman. 
Where are you? 
They found nothing. 
Are you tired? 
I will lend you as much money as you want. 
I've heard this song before. 
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world. 
They can't escape. 
Take things a little more seriously. 
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but there's something you should see. 
Who's free? 
They already knew. 
What are you looking for? 
I do not know. 
He put some coins in the box. 
She decided to be a doctor. 
Tom seems discontented. 
Tom never goes to places like that. 
They found Tom. 
Summer is almost over. 
I refuse to let you marry that man. 
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here. 
Nobody seems to be in charge. 
I came to Boston last month. 
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history? 
Tom is out of the office. 
We have plans. 
They didn't answer. 
Both of my kids have already graduated from high school. 
I also like candy. 
Armenia is a mountainous country. 
Yaguat√≠ likes swimming in the river. 
He came late, as is often the case with him. 
How could he have known? 
"Thank you." "You're welcome." 
Do we need a Plan B? 
I'll be waiting. 
We have made friends with Tom. 
I talked to her on the phone. 
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox? 
It is still light outside. 
What became of him? 
Why don't you like Tom? 
They both screamed. 
In a word, it's ridiculous. 
I wonder what became of them. 
Don't worry. 
I know your father. 
You're stronger today. 
Do you think I'm crazy? 
Tom certainly was polite. 
Can you come? 
I hope it'll be quiet. 
You're too big. 
What did you do to each other? 
I have no time. 
They followed Tom. 
Thanks for the advice, Tom. 
We have a lot to celebrate. 
What kind of man was he? 
Nobody likes bad news. 
We can't see it. 
He caught the cord. 
Tom doesn't like me much. 
Is that edible? 
Stand up! 
Maybe we can talk to her. 
I can hide everywhere. 
I think Tom forgot his camera. 
I thought that only I had thought of that. 
I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept. 
Tom doesn't seem tired at all. 
Listen to Tom. 
Your watch seems to be very valuable. 
You never said anything. 
I make lunch every day. 
Tom is in recovery. 
What's in these boxes? 
The city wants to extend the road. 
I, too, like candy. 
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world. 
He comes here every five days. 
Would you like something to drink? 
Let's do it. 
According to you. 
I gave him back his ring. 
I love you more than him. 
I knew I'd seen it before. 
He's three years older than I am. 
I'll be watching you. 
We arrived at the station at five. 
We're going to be late for the concert. 
The worst is still to come. 
Perhaps you should get one. 
Are you ready to go? 
Watch them closely. 
They found this. 
Where is my dog? 
You will be ignored. 
Oh, don't be like that. 
It's too expensive. 
What is your last name? 
You can mix different foods in a blender. 
I need to have a haircut. 
Lisa speaks not only English but also French. 
No one here pays. 
Keep her away from us. 
He's young and healthy. 
What's in these boxes? 
Your mom is here. 
They both coughed. 
I will be back soon. 
I'm about to get married! 
He doesn't have a sister. 
Why are you crossing the street? 
Eternal love doesn't exist. 
I didn't like what Tom gave me. 
We heard them. 
I was home all day yesterday. 
He is a man of profound knowledge. 
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help. 
They all talked. 
They executed Tom. 
Where did I put it? 
They buried it. 
The children's laughs spread throughout the forest. 
It's not going to happen to Tom. 
Let's go! 
He was arrested because he stole the money. 
We reported his disappearance. 
She must be angry. 
Would you like something to drink? 
In a word, life is short. 
Are you a student? 
We are doing something. 
Not until late at night did he come home. 
Enough! 
I wish I was in Boston. 
I've never had a beer in the middle of the day before. 
It looked funny. 
He named his son James. 
Friends do things together. 
They gave up. 
Did anybody follow you? 
Where are you from? 
In a store if you break something you must pay for it. 
Get lost! 
How are you going to stop them? 
Tom made three changes. 
Is your watch correct? 
Tom took everything to his office. 
Tom didn't go to the hospital. 
You will have to go without her. 
I don't speak Japanese. 
The store might be closed already. 
Tom knows time is running out. 
I am connecting this computer to the Internet. 
Tom got a bargain price. 
Mary's neighbor is a busybody. 
How did Tom solve the problem? 
Would you come our house? 
I love teaching kids Spanish! 
How could she have known? 
I want to see you smile. 
Few people have two cars. 
I think it's possible that he may come. 
They all giggled. 
How many times have you gone? 
I've never drank milk with tea. 
Did you lose something? 
Tom came over to my house last night. 
They found Tom. 
Tom's dirty clothes are on the floor. 
Do you like tea? 
During the battle, it was as if time had stopped. 
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out. 
You go first. 
This was left on the porch. 
Congratulations! 
We're leaving the day after tomorrow. 
I have a brand new pair of socks. 
Tom moved the flower pot to the left and the secret door slid open. 
Ask him. 
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world. 
The bathroom's on the left. 
You'll soon get used to eating Japanese food. 
Tom kind of looks like John. 
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old. 
As far as I know, Tom is still married. 
It wasn't you, was it? 
It's a piece of cake. 
Tom is connecting his phone to the Internet. 
I've got to do this now. 
Where is the bathroom? 
Are you mad? 
Do you want to do this or not? 
How many hotels do you think there are in Boston? 
I left my shoes at school. 
Didn't you see Tom at the party? 
Tom should've asked Mary for help. 
Tom doesn't have a home. 
They made me go there. 
We have a kid. 
It cannot be true. 
I'm leaving early next week. 
I thought Tom was from Boston. 
Don't tell my wife. 
I might be able to help her. 
She saw the file. 
"What do you want to know?" "Everything." 
Do you think it's safe to do that? 
They all died. 
My room is always clean. 
Tom and I used to play tennis together. 
These are my shoes and those are yours. 
They don't understand. 
This is a horse. 
Tom was blinded. 
The children ran toward the classroom. 
They arrested Tom. 
They called me. 
Where is the dog? 
Thanks for the support. 
It's too large. 
This is Mary's dog. 
Do you love me? 
Do you believe in God? 
It's big! 
He plays very well. 
That doesn't seem right. 
Tom almost never asks about that. 
The pain never went away. 
I want some food. 
They don't listen. 
The city was destroyed by fire. 
Excuse me. 
The more people you know, the less time you have to see them. 
They all looked. 
I'll loan you the money you want. 
He loves fishing. 
We've been married more than thirty years. 
Tom wished he was with Mary. 
They exchanged gifts. 
I lived in Boston for about three years. 
Are you free tomorrow? 
Few people seem to have read the book. 
The train was almost empty. 
Isn't it scary? 
You don't know a thing about me. 
They can help. 
An old woman limped along the street. 
She is a well-known singer. 
John sent me a letter written in German. 
I just want you to know that Tom is safe. 
They believe it. 
What happened in Vietnam was like a bad dream. 
I want that cat. 
They caught Tom. 
I've found something amazing! 
Stay with Tom in this room. 
What would you like to eat? 
I'm falling. 
I don't think my gift meant very much to Tom. 
I think I've found a meteorite. 
Tom has a moustache. 
Are you at home, too? 
I asked Tom to call you. 
Tom translated the contract into French. 
May I have your email, please? 
You are my friend. 
I have to find out when Tom plans to leave. 
You know her, I think. 
Can you get her? 
They'll find Tom. 
This plant has some burned leaves. 
Tom went back to his seat. 
She goes to the movies once a week. 
Tom certainly is knowledgeable. 
They came back. 
I spoke with my family. 
So far he has admitted nothing. 
Please excuse my being late. 
They can wait. 
She will return within an hour. 
We'll tell Tom everything he needs to know. 
Everyone has their own opinion. 
I have no home to live in. 
Have you ever had your fortune told? 
Are your parents going to be home? 
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto. 
I was a teacher. 
He fell victim to his own ambition. 
Now we don't know what to do. 
What have you taken? 
Tom was about to get into his car when he was shot. 
I am interested in books. 
John is a veterinarian. 
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table. 
He always told me the truth. 
Take a look at that. 
This discovery will be recorded in history. 
Tom has come to a decision. 
The news made him happy. 
Tom doesn't have to be at today's meeting. 
They decided to settle in a suburb of London. 
You can drive, can't you? 
Thanks for the inspiration. 
It's not that big of a deal. 
The English entered into the tea trade at that time. 
The children ran toward the classroom. 
I've never flown before. 
They continued eating. 
Just get back. 
She shut herself up in her room. 
A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert. 
Where can we meet you? 
Don't forget about us! 
It is too risky. 
They found nothing. 
I've had enough. 
Vegemite is a popular Australian foodstuff. 
My mother thinks of everything in terms of money. 
What's your last name? 
You are very brave. 
Should that happen, what will you do? 
They will change it. 
What do you want me to do? 
Don't forget the ticket. 
My mother doesn't like the heat of summer. 
I don't think we'll reach Boston before dark. 
This isn't my fault, is it? 
I traveled to Italy last summer. 
This isn't your fault, Tom. 
It's not only Tom that has to study. I have to study, too. 
I exercise because I want to stay healthy. 
I just don't know what to say. 
I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed. 
Cats have the ability to see in the dark. 
We have not seen each other since our school days. 
I think you should help her. 
They usually sleep in this room. 
We have to help her. 
This is important to them. 
Tom had something in his hand. 
My parents still haven't met my girlfriend. 
The whole plan is only based on his personal opinions. 
We didn't talk yesterday. 
Who told her to do that? 
Can you stay long? 
That boy over there looks about the same age as you. 
He thinks that he's the centre of the universe. 
Trousers of today sit much lower on the waist than they did centuries ago. 
When he arrived, I made coffee. 
Tom didn't kill anybody. 
I don't want to go to school. 
They all entered. 
I think Tom died. 
I didn't know Tom didn't understand French. 
Don't worry. This won't happen again. 
Let me go my own way. 
Do you drink coffee? 
Tom was at the gym for three hours yesterday. 
She was educated by her grandfather. 
We had Tom paint the wall. 
I thought Tom was from Boston. 
I walk twenty miles a day. 
Tom went to Boston three years ago. 
He proposed that we should start at once. 
Tom has a wife and three kids. 
Didn't you know that she passed away about two years ago? 
What did you do to each other? 
We need Tom's strength now. 
Let's go! 
They're waiting for it. 
The public is requested not to litter in these woods. 
Let's not go. 
Tom is drinking water. 
Is that all you're going to tell me? 
Tom accepted Mary's offer. 
I can't see my dad. 
How many people are on board the ship? 
Where do you think all the money goes? 
Could you find a room for my sister? 
I am thankful for my children. 
Tom is driving to the hospital. 
I have to get home before it gets dark. 
Tom and I'll both be there. 
Tom used to play the piano when he was younger. 
Are you looking for somebody? 
There's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof. 
The mob gathered round the car like so many flies. 
They are more active at night. 
Do you want me to call Tom? 
There's fresh bread and water here. 
Tom is clueless. 
This is an easy mistake to make. 
Tom obviously feels very passionate about this. 
I'll tell them you called. 
I didn't even know that you used to live in Boston. 
Where is the toilet? 
My parents were proud of me. 
Do you think Tom knows? 
Is it yours? 
Watch them closely. 
Spaghetti don't grow on trees. 
What became of her? 
I was in bed all day long yesterday. 
Should we wait for you? 
Tom doesn't appear to hear us. 
I'm at home. 
Isn't it remarkable? 
They don't care. 
Show me what you're capable of. 
He said I don't get enough sleep. 
Let's open it. 
They believed Tom. 
Let me explain. 
Take it off. 
I don't know. 
I could scarcely believe it. 
I am selling my goats. 
They all listened. 
Tom wanted to save the world. 
Do you believe in ghosts? 
I remember it all. 
Now you do it. 
This is my life's ambition. 
I saw Joe last Sunday. 
He will arrive on the afternoon of the 5th. 
This is the word which I would like to replace. 
We don't want her to leave. 
Learn to write. 
Tom lives on a farm in California. 
A mother is responsible for the conduct of her children. 
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while. 
Those are the children you gave the book to. 
Nobody called you. 
They bother me. 
Who turned off the light? 
I wish school would disappear forever! 
I was a teacher. 
I like candy, too. 
All the soldiers were gallant. 
He gets up at seven. 
The babies are screaming. 
Let me walk you to your car. 
Ever since his father died, David is very sad. 
They're here to protect him. 
We disputed for hours about what to write. 
Are you hungry? 
Does anybody know him? 
She could feel her knees shaking. 
This is kind of fun. 
We have made friends with Tom. 
We've been wondering where you've been. 
I spent all day yesterday with him. 
You should report this to the police. 
Tom took some money out of the drawer. 
Nobody understands me. 
I'm here because of her. 
This is Mary's dog. 
Could you send me more information by email? 
Thank you for your opinion. 
In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth. 
Good evening. 
He proposed that we should start at once. 
That was the scary part. 
I want you to get started right away. 
I'm as old as you. 
They found us. 
There's nothing I can do about it. 
He doesn't listen to his teachers. 
Is this Tom's wife? 
What did you call me in here for? 
We listen to music. 
I can't fix the seat. 
Do all of you speak French? 
He doesn't listen to his parents. 
They drove home. 
She got him to eat his vegetables. 
Broccoli is one of the best vegetables for you. 
Some people never listen. 
I'm tired of living this kind of life. 
She is younger than me. 
I know it's important to you. 
Tom drank milk. 
Congratulations! 
We corrected it. 
I'll wait for you. 
I haven't found anything yet. 
First, let us talk about the experiments conducted in laboratories. 
What do you want? 
How do you say that in Italian? 
Tom and Mary didn't invite me to their wedding. 
Did Tom go home? 
Are you sure you're ready for this? 
Tom hasn't written to me in a long time. 
He said, "Leave me alone." 
Who doesn't like the beach? 
I don't know. 
Don't you hear that? 
I want you to follow me. 
I want a knife with which to cut the rope. 
They entered cautiously. 
Did I write that? 
As a whole, the plan seems to be good. 
Tom turned off the music. 
I'll go and ask Tom. 
They arrested him. 
You have told Tom the truth, haven't you? 
Let's look in the closet. 
How will you manage without a job? 
Hurry up. 
You wouldn't lie. 
Tom is watching TV now. 
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox? 
I don't want 2013 to end. 
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission. 
We'll be waiting. 
What he says is very true. 
Do you think Tom knows how to get there? 
I hope you'll find what I'm searching for. 
My name is Jack. 
The answer was right in front of me. 
They all sat. 
She saw the file. 
He died yesterday. 
The government was earning more money than it needed. 
Don't give up your day job. 
It was a gift. 
I cannot afford to buy a car. 
Are you sure you're ready for this? 
They'll ask her. 
They followed you. 
What are you doing? 
Tom is getting ready to go to work. 
Does anybody have a problem with this? 
Tom must be winning. 
Can you wait about an hour? 
Tom didn't even text Mary to tell her he'd be late. 
He was asking about your health. 
In the mountain area, snow has fallen more than fifty centimeters deep. 
The mistake hastened his retirement. 
He never visited her. 
She is cold to me. 
No one respected men like him. 
I am free of debt. 
He is eager for success. 
I'm not chicken. 
I can speak many African languages. 
It is very important to keep your word. 
What's your last name? 
She is a well-known singer. 
I'm thirsty. 
We're flying above the clouds. 
They need to talk. 
Somebody is eating. 
You can do it. 
I'm sick. 
Tom doesn't know Mary is here. 
A new idea came to me. 
Tom and I had an agreement. 
I'm not talking about that. 
Let's go meet them. 
Tom used to be lazy. 
I wanted to see them. 
Do we have to pay anything? 
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up? 
Is your mom home? 
Much of what they wrote about never happened. 
Do you like apples? 
Our victory is secure. 
We close at 2:30. 
Horses are animals. 
Go away. 
I always have an uncomfortable feeling. 
My sister has three times as many books as I do. 
My mother thinks of everything in terms of money. 
This is your bag, isn't it? 
Thank you. 
Tom didn't show up for dinner. 
Tom didn't want to live any longer. 
I had never been there before. 
Tom doesn't even know my name. 
I'll loan you the money you want. 
Tom wept. 
I got to know my current girlfriend at the gym. 
It's no longer that way. 
They both work. 
You're going to tell us everything. 
I'll give it to Tom. 
I thought you had taken everything out of the office. 
Tom's patience has run out. 
I don't blame you. 
They both giggled. 
They came in. 
Is this your bicycle? 
Who are you waiting for? 
Can you see the woman standing behind Tom? That's Mary. 
This isn't my fault, is it? 
The jets took off one after another. 
They all know. 
What does Tom eat for lunch? 
He has left now. 
Bob has the habit of going to bed at 10:00. 
If it had not been for civil war, they would be wealthy now. 
I don't think Tom has met Mary yet. 
As he was about to leave, he said goodbye. 
I do not know. 
He failed the entrance exam. 
I bought a book about animals. 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 
It's a dictionary. 
I'll give it to you. 
Maybe it's a good thing Tom isn't here. 
It was her fault. 
Let's get it open. 
We'll get another one. 
They all drank. 
I clean up my room every Sunday. 
They arrested her. 
I've been wrong. 
I have to go to bed. 
He will get back from school. 
Don't you want to see your kids? 
Can you talk to him? 
Some of them are too much to bear. 
What else do you need? 
Tom drove along a desert road. 
I forgot to shutter the windows before the storm hit. 
There are 50 members in the club. 
Tom didn't get what he wanted. 
You have thirty minutes left. 
Must I clean the room? 
Tom's not a bad kid. 
I spent all day yesterday with her. 
The girls don't like that song. 
Everyone is anxious to know what has become of the former champion. 
We didn't talk yesterday. 
It was a lie. 
Everyone likes him. 
I'm sure you're very busy. 
For whom will you vote for president? 
I didn't trust him at first. 
I really like him, but not his circle of friends. 
The city wants to extend the road. 
Termites are destroying the houses. 
Call the police! 
We shall do this free of charge. 
My goal is to become a doctor. 
We're studying now. 
Do I have to pay you? 
I told Tom everything I could think of. 
I was up all night reading. 
They arrested him. 
What do you think I was doing? 
I didn't ask them any questions. 
She wept when she heard the terrible news. 
She is a well-known singer. 
That's enough. 
It's just a fantasy. 
I read a lot. 
Tom got stuck in a traffic jam. 
Thank you for your support. 
Why don't you want to come with us? 
He doesn't listen to his teachers. 
This is what's going to happen. 
Thanks for the opportunity. 
I don't know. 
We're concerned about Tom's future. 
The concert will take place next Sunday. 
The city was destroyed by fire. 
I don't have any cash on me. 
John sent me a letter written in German. 
The bottle is empty. 
You're probably right, Tom. 
Could you please turn the radio on? 
They both died. 
Good morning! 
Life begins at forty. 
Tom is voting. 
Tom won't be that easy to convince. 
He is good at handball. 
They all stood. 
Why don't we order pizza? 
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam. 
Now, take a deep breath. 
What happened to Tom's parents? 
Muiriel is 20 now. 
They all left. 
Have you ever seen one of these before? 
Tom doesn't really mean that, does he? 
Where is your school? 
It's time for the truth. 
I'm working in Tokyo now. 
This is the next one! 
Do you speak Italian? 
Should I ask them? 
I eat using a utensil. 
Tom gave it to us. 
So what does it mean? 
They appear dead. 
He showed me how to use this camera. 
They drank coffee. 
The bottle is full. 
Excepting Sundays he works every day. 
I'll make it simple. 
They stayed one more day together. 
Where does Tom live? 
I bought this book in Boston last month. 
Yesterday was my birthday. 
Tom thinks that I was in Boston last week. 
This truck is in need of repair. 
We have pictures. 
I'll be with you in ten minutes. 
Where do you live? 
He came over and cooked dinner for me. 
That was an evil bunny. 
He's young and healthy. 
It looks like Tom isn't interested in that. 
Give me a ride home.
