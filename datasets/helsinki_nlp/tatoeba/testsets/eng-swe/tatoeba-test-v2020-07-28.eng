I hate being late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be on my own.
What's that worth?
I'm happy to do it.
It is unfortunately true.
Let's decorate the Christmas tree.

Welcome.
It wasn't sensational.
Easy come, easy go.
Has everybody found their mistakes?
Where does your uncle live?
The house was silent.
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.

That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you care?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
My knee hurts when I bend it.

Tom glanced down.
It's OK.
I am responsible for his conduct.
Tom's scared.
I received an e-Reader for Christmas.
She plays hockey on the weekends.
You don't talk a lot.
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandma.
I remember the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Tom took off his clothes and stepped into the shower.
The other children call her Piggy.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm no good at dancing.
I told Tom to calm down.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She has undertaken too much work.
She is stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We never agree.
It is uncertain if the letter ever came or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pencil.
Are you going to stay in bed all day?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under the barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really planning to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows that's true.
She cried.
Can I see Tom today?
Nobody wants it.

I walk like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You are taller than me.
I wish you a happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bored me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone has a better suggestion.
The ice is very thick.
Understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You would've liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, including the boy.
Kate has a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan anyway?
Tom seems bored.
He is not mad.
There is no doubt as to who will be elected.
He was hurt.
Perhaps I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's strange.
Have you read the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equal rights for women.
What're you watching?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Hail, guildbrother.
Where is the Portuguese office?
My friends stood by me during the court case.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was only teasing.
Keep down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What is her problem?
Get dressed quickly.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The queue to the fitting rooms was winding through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
His car spun out of control going around the curve.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the town's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man cross the road.
Nobody is too old to learn.
I would do anything for love.
Two men wearing ski masks entered the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It pains me to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom ripped me off.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the parish.
Let me take a gander.
Tom wants our help.
Time is up. Hand in your papers.
My father is healthy.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have money, you have to do without.
I'm afraid to go home.
Go on and say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new energy.
Set the cake out on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's just what he needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I am already late.
Even my mom knows it.
He would have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who did you talk with?
The boy grabbed the cat by the tail.
How can you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I am out of work.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anybody?
I'd like to speak with Tom in private for a moment.
He's going to give in to temptation.
The television doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She acts like a child.
What's it like?
Mary believes she has special powers.
I know all this.
Everybody needs to know.
After the stop the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to speak to?
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
Tom put the book down.
I am the best.
English is difficult, isn't it?
I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine meeting him again.
Even during work, I secretly indulge my Internet addiction.
I never thought it'd be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I don't have it in me to go into the city.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom flashed his headlights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This is not a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everybody says they did.
There is no one here with that name.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
It'll have to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chain saw is broken.
You think she's cute, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is going to take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
A squid has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very clever.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never have I seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom's fast.
Approximately 4.9 percent of Finns are Finland-Swedes. In other words, people with Swedish as their mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom let the cat out of the bag.
What's the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not a hatchet.
Would you be able to write down the link to the site?
She enclosed a photo.
The walls in the old house were not straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everyone dreams.
Flour is made from wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd come to your senses.
On arriving home, I discovered the burglary.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.

Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love?
What's your favourite fast-food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'm going to do it.
We need to find it.
What is missing?
I can do it myself!
Set your mind at ease.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I've got great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You'll die soon.
This one's no good.
You're probably right.
Monday begins on Saturday.
It's really not worth the effort.
"How old are you?" "I'm sixteen."
I have a steel bladder.
Have you heard from Tom?
We visited places of historic interest.
We're having steak tonight.
Tickets are valid for just two days, including the day they are purchased on.
I have two foreign friends.
You may as well say it to him in advance.
