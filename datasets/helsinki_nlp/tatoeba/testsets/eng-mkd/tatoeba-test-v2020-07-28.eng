It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are you being treated?
I have a splendid idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom has promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't let anyone know where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That would take time.
Why aren't you going after him?
That's one of mine.
You seem to be cold.
I feel like walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Was I talking to you?
Did you like the bicycle?
He's a bread lover.
I felt like an idiot.
I'm not getting enough help from Tom.
I'm not going to take advantage of Tom.
Tom was overweight.
What does that mean for him?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've met only once.
Thank you for letting me speak with Tom.
Let's fire them.
What's it worth?
The water came up to our necks.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped pacing.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom isn't my father.
Tom is a neighbor.
Tom has left already.
It's probably still available.
You looked lovely.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is served between 7 and 9.
Tom came last week.
They were all scared.
I've been watching.
You picked a nice one.
Nudists regard nudity as normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan expressed his racist beliefs in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine. Give it back.
Wolves stalked the flock.
That song hunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Has Tom paid the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You guys are wrong.
Tom was productive.
Racists are dumb people.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever shot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
She got the ticket in vain.
I don't want to turn myself in.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing?
Tom has no children.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch was guaranteed.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should've known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his telephone ringing.
Tom did what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for the position is very intense.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he hasn't been a good father and is trying to make amends.
Tom isn't good at pretending.
Tom said that he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom glanced down.
I love honey.
I need to confess something.
Alcohol influenced him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know jack.
Tom glanced around.
They're quite safe.
Tom blushed a little.
No one really cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would've said no.
I have to help him.
He criticizes everything.
You'll understand when the time comes.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out his gum.
I really love your eldest sister.
Can you see that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on the picnic with John.
Don't be fresh with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous! We are not descended from apes, we only have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there something in particular that you want to see?
What time do you usually eat lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting your job?
It took all evening.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks that he's too cool for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're sort of rude.
It sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop bad mouthing Tom.
What could go wrong?
When will I get to Boston?
Tom ate a late breakfast.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
Someone's in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm obese.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
I happen to like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary fast-forwarded the movie.
She has good handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report by himself.
Can people buy these?
He doesn't seem so well.
Hey, can I have that?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me just a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I am in London.
It won't be lonely here.
She asked me to take a look at it.
I think we'd better not go out in this storm.
It took me a long time to rid myself of all those ants.
Do we really want to eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you do it in reverse?
Tom and Mary were talking in French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Do you like singing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs whenever I have a cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you so you can understand it.
Everybody seeks happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was horrible to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat which still had the price tag attached.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't like Tom much, do you?
One must distinguish.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the papers said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
Tom is obedient, almost submissive.
What page is Tom on?
Mike said that he would come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
A man cannot be made in a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run for it!
Is there a delivery charge?
I want a second helping.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed's empty.
He has a bad heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I’m going to be okay.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've put this off for far too long. You will finish it tonight!
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What is it with you and him?
Whatever you do, do it quickly.
I think I know how to find him.
We accept checks.
This newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You got one right.
Macedonian has four verbal moods: indicative, conditional, imperative, and renarrative.
They haven't left.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom started smiling.
Tom isn't very happy.
Could I talk to you, Tom?
These pants fit me well.
I don't have a gun.
I need authorization.
We're the champions.
You frightened Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't litter!
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's exactly what got me in trouble in the first place.
What exactly happened to you?
How are you not sleeping?
I'm getting advice from them.
Tom began screaming.
This tooth has to have a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is large.
It's a game for children.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll return at 6:30.
Tom told me to get lost.
I was only gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
She made a fuss for no good reason.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Keep a low profile.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom is a doofus.
Who's on your list?
He had a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, pal.
Let me out of here.
I'm just glad it wasn't you who did this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
The girl saw it, too.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do that right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're up against.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I walk with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom is a big spender.
Tom is the only one who can answer that question.
One of Tom's complaints is the food.
Be careful not to step in the mud puddle.
They both coughed.
The train traversed a tunnel.
Tom is overemotional.
Mary hasn't washed the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are any meals included?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It'll be all right.
It's boiling in here.
That can't be her.
Today is the fatal day that they will attempt their escape.
Everyone went crazy.
People are beginning to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still yes.
I'm here looking for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why are you working for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was at home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom has gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Tom might be playing chess with Mary right now.
It looks as if you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you won't help him?
Tom's room is messy.
There are no survivors.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I slapped him.
Tom is with somebody.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.

It is worth quoting one famous section of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is inconsiderate.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right to it.
Didn't you hear me call?
Let's take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back.
Remove the tourniquet.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
I thought you didn't want the reward.
Look at that smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're insincere.
Why can't you go now?
You learn to appreciate your health when you are ill.
Look at this shining star.
I don't know how to help him.
Strap yourselves in.
Make him confess!
I know none of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows that you hit Tom.
Can't you help me just a little bit?
I like this school.
Call if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When does your passport need to be renewed?
Mary doesn't have enough courage to confront Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
I got that from Tom.
There is not a grain of truth in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm such a retard!
We've discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where is the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
An electric heater warms up the ceramic tiles of the bathroom floor.
Tom gave Mary a hand.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came for a visit yesterday.
Tom left a message for you.
I have to go find them.
This task requires dexterity.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys were climbing down from the canopies.
Let's forget it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he abandoned his plans of living outside the country.
You catch on quickly.
You must not give up.
Didn't you get one?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize it all.
I don't quite know.
I initially hated it.
He got his sleeve caught.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know it yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Keep quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he didn't feel cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting darker.
The tubes are clogged.
I've offended you, haven't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They crouched down beside him.
Tom isn't a vegetarian.
I think he's correct.
We slept in a tent.

Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to leave here at once.
I'm ready to do it.
The water reached my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you're going to have to release Tom.
How shameful!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where should I park?
Doesn't anyone care?
How's that your fault?
Tom took a drink from a bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Come in and sit down.
You share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this play start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks don't match.
Tom talked Mary into donating some money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your old dog named Cookie?
I just bought a boat.
You really fooled her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I put it on the table.
You're thin.
Tom began laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I am not feeling very well today!
Tom opposed the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm happy to be done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold it!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one here.
It is a multi-stage process.
I have a small gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk about Boston too much.
It's yours for the asking, Tom.
Tom isn't shy at all.
Tom ran down the hill.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
This mustard really bites the tongue.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was lovely.
Tom was a good man.
Tom sat beside Mary.
I had a few auditions, but never got a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom is too old to be living on his own.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
You have been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I must find a way to help them.
Is Tom able to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is just my age.
Gold is heavier than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anybody in there?
Have you read this yet?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew that Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
It's almost time for her to go.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom is struggling.
Tom unfolded the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, she didn't get what she hoped for.
I just fired them.
This has been fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom needs some serious help.
You have to stay away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom put his arms out.
There's nothing you and I won't do.
He said that his previous dentist told him that he'd remove nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to think the same way you do.

Curry powder is composed of several spices.

Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who'll be there?

Are you planning to stay here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks dubious.
Keep it to yourself.
You've got one now, don't you?
I'm pretty zonked.
I don't have a job.
My old English teacher is certainly rolling in her grave right now.
People often complain of how others treat them unjustly, failing to perceive that their own behaviour is quite objectionable.
She wears high heels to make herself look taller.
Do you like bowling?
Excuse me, I think you've dropped something.
You should just talk to Tom.
I'm correct.
I've been burgled three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to workout.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make any noise.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was utterly humiliated.
Don't call me a jerk.
Why does it matter anyway?
We meet at last, Tom.
I bought that book for him.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He abandoned the idea.
I probably sound ridiculous.
It's nice and cool.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did somebody hit Tom?
We've got one rule around here.
Tom made a decision.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was so nice a day that we went for a hike in the mountains.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate language.
Coffee gives you energy!
Tom was a nice man.
He likes soccer a lot.
Why do you ask me that?

Sometimes I'm scared of the dark.
We'll miss you, Tom.

Tom can write well.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll see to it that Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own house.
Tom already told me.
They must abandon the idea.
Tom is really peeved.
Why did he leave so suddenly?
We all find her behaviour abhorrent.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose paper is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes flashed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have some news.
This is a good place to pitch our tent.
That was beautiful.
Permit me to stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom might have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
You'll have to ask him that.
You made a promise.
We're ready to go if you are.
I want you to keep your promise.
I can see I'm not needed here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest person I know.
"I like traveling." "So do I."
There are many birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I'm the one Tom wanted to meet.
You should ask them to help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom might be richer than we thought he was.
I never wanted to deceive you.
What on earth was all that about?
I have no such desire.
I made a few calls.

Smoking means suicide.
Beetles, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's build a fire.
I wanted to get this to you ASAP.
Which cap is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom skinned his knee.
Where do pine nuts come from?
Can I talk to you upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I must rest.
May I look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom removed his coat.
Can you come with us, please?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed and the crowd applauded.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
Dogs are white.
Get him away from here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's a writer, too.
I nearly had a heart attack.
I recognize that guy.
Help me out here, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
It was really touching.
Bring her inside.
You cook turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, and that's that.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking two years ago.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting by himself.
I already feel much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as difficult to do as I thought it was going to be.
I am hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want to be seen.
It's a shame that concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom suddenly stopped.
My father used to take me here when I was young­.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm tough.
Tom arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He always parades his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig is wasted.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is it the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What'll happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
An automobile has four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What help is that?
That's quite helpful.
Tom's phone vibrated.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
It turns out that you are unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice is a great time saver. You can form opinions without having to get the facts.
That didn't go very well.
We've got to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't look at them.
Tom didn't eat lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the work again.
I'm not quitting now.
This room is cramped.
I fired her.
Don't be such a fool.
I can't open this jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you come back to work.
Tom couldn't contain himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate one another?
I didn't catch that.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom gave it some thought.
I'm perfectly comfortable waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
It's not a high priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
Get it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won't succeed.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I'm ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never surrender.
I hope you're up to the challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did you fire us?
Last night I was at home.
The girl that works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom isn't very young.
The element phosphorus is present in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda felt nauseated and suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a dog.
I feel kind of sick.
I will work to the best of my ability.
I have cash.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed everything.
Tom threw the dart.
Don't look surprised.
I'm not safe in here.
Much to my dismay, Mary came to the party wearing a prurient dress.
I'll say anything you want me to.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to be helping them.
Don't turn your back.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
Get them over here right away.
Tom is living abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Are you able to help us at all?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
He sat next to the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That really doesn't seem possible.
Thanks for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved the puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom wiggled his toes.
You know me better than you realize.
I can't get them out of my mind.
He has big problems.
This is not blue; it is violet.
Who were you with?
Tom went with Mary to Boston.
Lambs are usually killed before they are one year old and eaten by humans.
Can you get this arrow out of my leg?
I forgot just how clever you can be.
Can I see that one?
He spends money like water.
We have no secrets.
I guess I just wasn't thinking.
I'm not so convinced.
Let's end this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain it.
Go on ahead.
This book is heavy.
Why do we need to find her?
All I'm saying is be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel are really very bad at muffling sounds. I can hear my neighbor chewing his gum!
Were you frightened?
Please feed the cat.
We're going to be OK.
Let's stroll around the bazaar!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the keyhole.
Look at us.
It was two months ago that I arrived in Tokyo.
Are you teasing me?
Please talk to me.
Angels guard and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't work.
My grammar is poor.
Tom was available.
Tom is going to town.
I am curious about Japanese culture.
This is reality.
Who saw me?
Tom is getting close.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wished he could tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That did the trick.
These goats are playful.
Tom went fishing.
Tom never for one instant thought of trying to convince Mary to do that.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since I finished college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I wish I'd called you.
May I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not backwards.
Tom is a heavy sleeper.
Be very good and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood in awe before her.
There are several exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house is under renovation.
He gave me a half dozen linen handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven't had time to write the report yet.
I can do without it.
There are those who wish to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
It's getting cloudy.
Tom threatened Mary.
There was no stopping Tom.
I love to walk along the river in the mornings.
You've got to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We've got to find him.
He took advantage of me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I don't find the formula.
You're in command.
I'm thirty.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry. We'll find him.
I'll use my imagination.
How about a sandwich?
I know what to study.
Hand in your papers.
It was an awful sight.
Dan's knife was covered with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink to excess.
We'll follow her.
Everybody down here sure likes you a lot, Tom.
Today, at midday, we shall eat cherries from Italy.
Tom is also from Boston.
Be careful. It's a fierce bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on duty today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sun block.
You have no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Tonight sounds good.
They travelled eastwards.
Tom is quite strong.
I can't stand that bloke.
You're the owner.
Water is a source of life.
The tiles that fell from the roof broke into pieces.
Who's the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the bathtub.
Stop by anytime.
Tom would've thrown us out.
Tom didn't feel embarrassed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up! It's urgent.
You'd better leave.
Tom missed the exit.
I have two cameras.
What're you up to?
Dan confessed to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put down his drink.
My wallet was stolen on the bus.
Don't fight with me.
You seem to have some trouble understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm of no use to you here.
Was anyone injured?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I got paid to paint Tom's picture.
I know that wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary shout.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoeba is a protozoan.
If you do that to me, I will cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Tom is dead.
Waves are generated by wind.
Take a clean glass from the cupboard.
This is not a joke.
None of it matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say that he's very rich.
I'll pay my own way.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a possibility that I'll be killed.
I left a message for her.
Was that all you saw?
It'd be a disaster.
I love how the French spell their word for ladybug.
The crane can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're fascinating.
I think it's a little risky to do that without some help.
Are you good at it?
We're pretty good.
The pork is diced and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love trips.
Love is the answer for everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had problems dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book hasn't yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a vast sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it was pretty boring.
You have a guilty conscience, don't you?
I coughed up blood.
I just need a minute.
The capital city of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should've asked you first.
Do you know how Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a tissue, your nose is running.
Tom walked with Mary.
I've just seen Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
Originally they were farmers.
All you have to do is believe me.
I just don't want you to do something you'll be sorry for.
I'm upset.
Tom seldom goes out.
We put up a tent.
I didn't think it would rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you were staying.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll look after Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't speak to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm fairly healthy again.
Tom was still in his pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that one.
Walk this way.
You've been demoted.
The sentence is not grammatically accurate.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
I was invited to their wedding.
Do you have any other questions you want to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
In the middle of the city, there is a fountain.

The reader will quickly realise that my analysis is precise and that her results are reliable.
I've tried.
A fallen tree blocked the path.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom has a fast car.
All of my attempts have failed.
Mathematics is his strongest subject.

I can get it from her.
Bring food.
It may be hard.
I'm not casting a spell over their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think you've been lied to.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom is downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
He works us too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be a husband at every wedding, and the deceased at every funeral.
Tom is probably OK.
I believe in ghosts.
My father is home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you give it a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Enjoy your evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
A humid climate is characteristic of the peninsula.

Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.

Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.

This is where I spend most of the day.
Should we wait for her here?
If you go out wearing that little you will catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was rather funny.
I framed him.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's happening?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everybody busy?

Stop badgering me.

I'll do it anyway.

There was no avoiding them.
We need to find him tonight.
It's too conspicuous.
I wish I'd called them.
Pray to the Lord and not his prophets.

I got even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where're you going?

I should've been more polite.
Keep Tom entertained.
It's still rising.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.

Tom can't mean that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary prided herself on her beauty.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was insolent.
That's not a good enough reason.
First, there's something I'd like to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
That was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What's the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she comes back.
I haven't got any pen.
At what point do we start to worry?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They came to the conclusion that the ship must have sunk.
Did you buy the medicine?
Has Tom been drinking?
My shoulder hurts.
The question is who's going to do it.
I'll drive to Boston tomorrow.
They detest him.
Is everybody happy?
I thought we could sit here for a while and just talk.
Forget about it, OK?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.

It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.

Please ask me anything.
Hey, what gives?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom is under a doctor's care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom is a child prodigy.
He walks to school.
It is starting to sink in that we can't ignore nature.
I don't see why you won't help.
Tom seems very full of himself.
The question now is what should we be doing.
When did you last talk to Tom?
He ranked fourth on a total of 56 runners.

Don't make a liar out of me, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not so little.

Can I talk to you about them?

They all turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That cannot be true.
Tom is done.
We should help them.
These guys are very immature.
Tom didn't reply at once.
He has enormous potential.

Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious and get even better after he's had a few beers.
You have cute eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your sack or his?

Yeah, right, he'll mend his ways. When Hell freezes over.
Tom is a consultant.
May I talk with you?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when are there fireworks?
Tom might be lonely.

I want to know when your birthday is.
What were you guys talking about?
Keep your fingers crossed for me!
The concert concluded with the national anthem.
We've been out looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I won't move.
Hold on one second.
It gives me something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
She ran as fast as she was able to.
I've won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's plenty of air in here.
She has married a nobody.
The wind calmed down.
Nothing's been changed.
You don't need to wear anything fancy.
The old man became childish before his death.
I don't like this book.
I made a lucky guess.
What would Tom want that for?
The sun is just a star amongst zillions of others.
I came down with measles.
Can anyone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to become famous.
That's pretty normal.
Have you googled her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Stay out of my way, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was hospitalized.
I hated her.
I've still got a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in parks is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, that explains it.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope I got that right.
Are you sure we don't need an appointment?
Whoever can listen to butterflies laughing can also know how clouds taste.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Don't make iftar into gluttony!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it one bit.
I just got off duty.

I'm not a student.
I have flu and I'm tired.
Mary had a flower in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food's cold, put it in the microwave.
The creek's to our right.
Tom isn't an old man.
This seems deceptively simple.
I want my life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved up.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
That guy is a bandit.
Tom may have seen it.
Tom limps slightly.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?

A whale is a sort of mammal.
Dan hit Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems disturbed.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" - "No, did you?"
Thanks to all of you for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's awful.
What is on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm here on holiday.
He has wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're no longer a spring chicken.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably wrong.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe that we've actually done this.
How many miles is it to Boston?
I'm very good at it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
I am ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
It was still there.
I've got lots of questions.
Who runs things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might possibly say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I'd never take it.
It's going to get even colder.
What're you drinking?
Easy come, easy go.
His feet were asleep.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.
Tom might be drunk.
Sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underrated.
Can you locate this place on the map for me?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?

Look ahead.
We have never done it before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom pestering you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't felt well for two days.
This hose is junk. It kinks way too easily.
We don't think so.
I think Tom is rich.
It must've slipped my mind.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police have arrested her.
Take these.
We've been expecting her.
Going out in this rain is out of the question.
I'll have them go right away.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got a good one.
Not a soul was to be seen in the town.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's no problem.
Do you want to sit?
Tom was dubious.
Tom threw a rotten egg at Mary.
We're all safe.
OK, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom might not really be as busy as he says he is.
Nothing that's happened here makes any sense.
I framed them.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like watching lesbian porn.
And just who might you be?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Please stay quiet.
Tom was immediately concerned.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little more.
I already believe it.
He's writing his mother a letter.
They're different.
What've you written?
Tom feigned surprise.
For the boy to swim across the river was impossible.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
I felt the same way.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old cottage has a certain charm about it.
This subject is taboo.
We barely survived.
Did you get the job?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was texting.
You'll get better.
Tom was a bit woozy.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
Tom was motivated.
You may have to help us.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a chicken.
Dude, you can't just go up to a woman and grope her. That's sexual harassment!
I decided to tell her that I love him.
Find your higher power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
It's your loss.
We rolled up the rug.
I call for a vote.
Tom has been sedated.
You can't do whatever you like.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Should I continue?
It was really windy.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The ship hull is divided into watertight compartments.
I'll do the dishes, since you cooked.
Let's drop the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming back home?
They were attacked.
You have to stay in shape.
She has fake eyelashes.
I don't have all day.
There's only one cookie left.
Tom doesn't like doing that.
I'm working on that.
Did you hear a knock?
I'm not going to wait for them.
There's no need to be scared.
"Are you angry at me?" "You bet I am!"
He is no longer the shy boy he was.
Get it?
Don't cause a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I've got to get him to help.
We have lots to do.
Tom never was mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together. Some played at marbles, at hopscotch, at ball. Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses.
Suspicion is destructive of friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was covered in snow.
I worked for them.
There isn't much milk left in the bottle.
We should both go.
The pain caused by love is much sweeter than any pleasure.
It was nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're going to find her.
You're wrong about her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from inside.
Nobody believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He banged his head.
We started to walk.
Put the seat back.
What is its purpose?
What's Tom carrying?
Expect no mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is getting angry.
I'm not finding the equation.
They are listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not satisfied.
We think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yup, I am angry.
It is less humid today than it was yesterday.
I have trouble making new friends.
It's strange that people in hot climate zones eat spicy things like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do something?
Tom had no family.
I cannot really say which one the baby wants, since he's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I must be going home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Despite being rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom has a bad cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't like to cook.
Let's go and get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't be doing this.
You're no friend of mine.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned the TV off.
It's a red herring.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that ever happened here.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Can you fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
Have you had lunch?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slit on one side.
Let's have a bite to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I manage just fine.
She doesn't know how to read or write.
Tom has hurt his leg.
Step inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed it.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I think Tom has stopped breathing.
That's all over now.
Nobody went with me.
I know Tom will eventually get out of prison.
The most expensive thing is land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom has written down a list of things we need to do.
Tom is a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
The milk tastes sour.
We ran short of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary for a job.
Why do you resist?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first one to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
He's my husband's dad. He's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That's likely to be a problem.
Calculate how much money we will need next year.
I struck a match in the darkness.
How much is that over there?
God willing!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Do you get up at six?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is really cool.
Tom spends too much time on the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I just languished in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You are under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard correctly.
Tom has a headache.
Duh.
It's clear.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to let it go.
You did your best.
He is a glutton.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mummy is buying me a toy.
I'm not going to take that chance.
The house requires repairs.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom is an errand boy.
Tom doesn't listen.
They want everything right now that you said you'd give them.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were some witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are totally different.
I go fishing every week.
What did you decide?
Is that necessary?
Tom remained behind.
I'll never stop loving you.
He made it look easy.
You'd better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well ran dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you'd better call them.
Some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
Why should I do this?
Does your dog bark at them?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I like German doughnuts a lot.
We were eighteen at that time.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
Crossing that desert is dangerous.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
Seeing him with his girlfriend puts me in a bad mood.
Tom ran off.
He went on doing it.
This is revolting.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Has Tom been injured?
You've been drugged.
Tom began to get downhearted.
I think you should choose her.
Behave yourself.
You're magnificent.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish!
Go ahead and open it up.
Tom gave Mary an icy stare.
Tom wore a hoody.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom has gone to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I swam in the river.
Are you through yet?
How long's it been?
Don't burn yourself.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
If possible, I'd like to see him.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't do the dishes.
Tom is a funny guy.
I've been a lot worse.
Tom did his best to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I had only one drink.
Nobody writes to me.
Tom is heartbroken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're pessimistic.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone stayed calm.
Every client has rights.
I'm just calling to say hi.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they spotted me.
I have Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We are victorious.
Tom says he's never been sick a day in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is a pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll come right now.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is false: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who is Dan talking to?
They cursed us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his father at all.
Tom isn't very tough.
It was after midnight.
That's an outrage.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed shampoos?
Tom looked around as if waiting for something to happen.
I was persuaded to stop smoking.
Here it is warm. You could put away your coat.
I don't think I was followed.
They're defenseless.
He often helps others.
Tom is very pessimistic.
You get one phone call.
Skiing is actually a lot more fun than I expected it to be.
Tom swam in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's head back home.
That's all for now!
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Come on let's catch that guy.
I'm trying my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to intrude.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't joking.
Fill out this form.
That's not my idea of fun, but whatever floats your boat.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom buttered his toast.
We have work to do.
I heard him sniffle.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on that hill.
I'll take anything.
It will not be fine.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and her children alone.
What are some of your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
I'm afraid this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to these kinds of problems.
You'll be all right.
It was all so easy.
I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth.
He rarely went there.
Tom is motionless.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, always, the victorious side is right and the vanquished side is wrong.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
If it is even possible, translating jokes is quite hard.
It was a good day.
I have some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome weakness.
How many push-ups do you do every day?
I'll just sit here.
You don't have a key, do you?
Let's be realistic.
A tea with lemon, please.
Tom's out of a job.
This may help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body reeked of alcohol.
Tom is getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is tricky.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Were you one of them?
He has a small frame.
I'll see to it that we complete this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
Your handshake is too tight.
What if we don't find them?
Don't make me come after you, Tom.
He came first in the competition.
I just want you back.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often takes a walk before dinner.
She sat up late last night.
You're unscrupulous.
Everybody was silent.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad. What's wrong?
He abandoned the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we going to find them?
It may seem strange.
No one is saved from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Someone open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I want you back in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Do we need them that badly?
He was in despair over health problems.
Do you know why Tom wasn't at the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has an earache.
Dan was hit on the forehead with a hammer.
What gave you that idea?
What has Tom been doing?
You're having a nightmare.
Now isn't the time.
You're out of booze.
What time are you going?
I would like to buy a sofa.
I never got an answer from her.
Let's put the Christmas tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I can't get this song out of my head.
Tom has seen this.
The car gave a jolt.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What does Tom have in mind?
A mother's advice would outweigh a friend's.
We're not out of danger yet.
Tom is getting angry.
He waited ten minutes.
She wore a vest.
Dan is now wanted by the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw it over there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
They're moving fast.
It's urgent that I see Tom.
Tom is waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've made it worse.
I like to listen to Tom's stories.
Tom has seen worse.
We know each other.
Cooking pasta is easy.
The hunter went deep into the forest, never to return.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay anything.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming! You're giving me a headache.
I'm not having you boss me around, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a marvelous sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't gloat.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'll become stronger.
This elephant is adored by small children.
Thanks a lot, Tom.
This is difficult for her.
Mary put on some lipstick.
She has a picture.
He's good at swimming.
The flowers are wilting.
Take a walk with me.
You've got my word on that.
This is so annoying.
We really need more American slang on Tatoeba, stat!
We're sorry.
Tom may chicken out.
Is this seat vacant?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I like tea.
The last thing I want to do is butt in.
Won't anyone sit with you?
I really wish you'd be quiet.
Tom said Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It hasn't been easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm getting kicked out of school.
I often listened to him playing the melody on the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is responsible for producing all art and literature.
This is extremely hard for them.
Tom is being silly.
I don't think Tom will be here on time.
Stick to your plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's insecure.
Make sure that the gas has been turned off.
Would you take part in this event?
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
Me, I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in any hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy the company of humans.
I sleep standing up.
I intend to use it.
Would you please give Tom a message?
He flirts so forcefully that he ends up pushing women away.
Tom, by accident, set the curtain on fire.
Is Tom talking to you yet?
Self-harm is difficult to understand if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is going to hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin the evening for everyone.
The pressure builds.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom has had that car for years.
Can myrtle be used in cooking?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom is shaking salt on his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I don't like to talk about them.
We're busy right now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm wasted.
They have no choice.
No one's going to find me.
Tom got really mad.
In what kinds of situations would you use it?
Can't we start over?
I'm afraid you're going to have to do this without any help.
We're all at risk.
Tom won't want it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back here for years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sport?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He is afraid of getting lung cancer.
I feel very chilly.
Tom played the piano for three hours without taking a break.
I got a good one.
Did you get someone to look after the child?
I'm quiet.
He chased the thief.
It was a remarkable experience.
Tom chuckled aloud.
Does it really matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk with me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The present government has many problems.
Tom never killed anyone.
I won't say anything.
It'd be good.
It's a short walk.
Tom is very stingy.
That's all I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan pulled Linda to safety.
They are my cousins.
It's already eleven.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom considered it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
Man is sinful.
I can't wait to find out what Tom has made for me as a present.
I've seen it myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not going to do what you ask.
Tom seems flustered.
What would you know?
Whose photo is this?
There's no substitute.
A hypochondriac imagines maladies where none exist.
My sister has her hair done at the hairdresser two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
The rainwater evaporates on a hot day.
Ask him to wait till I come.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It seems well written.
That was the whole idea.
Tom must still be at school.
I never say anything, even though it gets on my nerves.
You're not in his league.
I like to be early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why can't you just call them?
Tom might hire Mary, but I don't really know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry up so you'd catch the last train.
Please air the room.
Tom is still trying to talk Mary into taking the job.
What percentage of our bodies is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think I can.
That's very clever.
Please help me in welcoming Tom.
You're very clever.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't take more than five minutes.
As time passed, the radioactivity diminished.
Can we believe that?
Why are you so dressed up?
I think I know how to keep it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll give them a call.
It always happens the same way.
Chemistry gave us plastics.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for my PC.
You're gay.
What're you up to?
Why are you mean to me?
I cannot read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thanks for inviting us.
Tom dried the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom was very clear.
They must be worried.
I gave him a ride.
That gave me an idea.
The watch spring broke.
I asked around about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Everyone, follow me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't really old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need loving.
That's his business.
I just wish I had my camera.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You need to do that somewhere else.
It scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You must keep an eye on the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm just feeling a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's quite delicious.
Let's go sledding.
You may sleep here.
Talking to him always puts me in a good mood.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was fun.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me.
How many litres of oil are there in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
Another world is possible.
We have nothing you want.
This pear is green.
Tom wished he hadn't told Mary anything.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom started mumbling.
I can understand you.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm going to scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
Everybody sat down.
He softly touched her.
Maybe we should turn back.
I don't like to walk.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a meeting.
We're about to start.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What's your hobby?
Look, I'm being serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was required.
Donate what you're willing to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give the signal?
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
They won't be coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom returned to Boston.
The light faded out.
Come on!
What if Tom says no?
I changed my shirt.
I've been dying to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to eat breakfast in bed.
Dan is walking his small dog.
It had to be done.
I knocked over that lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice over for dinner.
I'm sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed what Mary said.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience can't be handed down — everyone has to come up with their own.
I wanted to believe Tom was happy.
This cloth stretches a great deal when it's washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom began talking.
I cut class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard to catch any fish.
Tom dozed.
I think she is good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupted.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion counts for much.
Alcohol lowers inhibitions.
Tom needs your help.
I'll have him go right away.
Tom looks baffled.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were as black and deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to speak, but he couldn't.
Bring her along.
I think Tom is obese.
I think Tom is hurt.
Tom just wanted Mary to help him a little more with the children.
They all have drinks.
Tom lifted the box.
He is a harsh critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget anything?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I let you catch me.
Put the radio on, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is quite a place.
I've got plenty to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to forgo his morning swim, on account of it being too cold.
It's not necessary.
I just want the situation resolved.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
I'll call.
This isn't the way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom yelled.
Please repeat.
You're so dramatic.
Tom licked his lips.
Tom didn't even know that Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
They say that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family begins where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We've been trying.
It's so cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook something for you.
You're overworked.
Could that be Tom?
I have to get her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your bravery.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe impressions at the crime scene.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran outside half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who is going to tell him.
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom must not be permitted to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat the bigger my appetite gets.
What'll you give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a turncoat.
I'm going to have to try and handle this myself.
They scanned the spaceship with a probe.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Do you know for sure that these are real diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I was finished?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
You don't know jack.
I looked at her.
A large crowd of people gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've been in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unstable.
Get your hands off of Tom.
Are you people crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Could you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
I like it that way.
Would you do me a favour?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I sliced the sandwich diagonally.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two children.
To put it briefly it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom rushed into the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You are my happiness.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left some food on his plate.
Tom changed course.
There's no one in the classroom.
The rocket went up.
We laughed.
Tom was a little startled.
Tom is just visiting.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
Have a good trip.
Return to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to look busy, so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I very rarely eat meat.
I'll go and ask her.
I'm saving this seat for him.
Tom couldn't help.
I'm going to call her later.
Flowers soon fade when they have been cut.
I called them yesterday.
I carry a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom isn't a good writer.
I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
Moreover, I can fly.
Our money ran out.
There was hatred between us then.
There's nothing to see here. Let's go.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
He and I are friends.
I may admire others but I have never aspired to be like anyone, other than myself.
Sometimes it's a little hard to tell if Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't burn.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Children are sometimes afraid of the dark.
Stand aside.
I had to stay behind.
Tom is the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom will catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom became depressed.
I was worried sick.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's the one I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there is hope.
I heard them sobbing.
I wish I had ridden my bicycle here.
I have to visit Tom.
What's making you uneasy?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear suggestive clothing.
This is classified.
That's not so many.
You said that an hour ago.
I don't want to end up dead.
Well, I'll be damned!
I prefer walking by myself.
How many plants did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son has died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I wouldn't want to show you up.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
You never gave them a chance.
Tom appeared suddenly.
I'll do what you say.
That's a long story.
Tom will be great.
Tom was nice to all Mary's friends.
That'd be fun.
He deals in used cars.
Cherish the thought.
I'm not going away.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom is cold.
Emily is a teenager.
They think it's superfluous.
Who was the thief?
He has charm.
The question is who decides what needs to be done.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My recorded voice does not sound like my natural voice.
I told you that this would become tiresome.
I didn't know whether to get angry or to laugh.
I'm angry at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at 7:00.
I always wanted a dog.
You're quite safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether he will come to visit us next month.
The puppets are controlled by wires.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls teased her about her clothes.
You'll be confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom has already done what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them one more chance.
I just got a call from him.
The failure depressed him.
How've you been, Tom?
I can't bear to look at him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Even she doesn't understand me.
Beekeepers believe that GM crops adversely affect the health of their bees.
You're now free to go.
They're stalling.
Tom is a sophomore.
If I can understand it, anyone can.
The tourists were not happy.
Tom removed his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom is stuttering.
Laws are like cobwebs, which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through.
You are prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, as he usually did.
He removed his fur jacket downstairs, went up, and knocked lightly on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see this eye to eye, but it's not me who is wrong.
Something was wrong with Tom.
You like your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we are full.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
She's texting her boyfriend.
Has anybody seen Tom?
He avoided danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I need to repeat it?
I think you've been spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is a remarkably beautiful city.
This handle will not turn.
I think that you are right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Tit for tat."
We were really tight.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
Nobody defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
Tom is a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is astounding.
Let me catch my breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where is my wallet? Nevermind! I just found it under the couch.
He is watching TV now.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I suppose that's OK.
You can chain me, you can torture me, you can even destroy this body, but you will never imprison my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It keeps happening.
I wish I could be as happy as you.
Try on this sweater.
The cat dug its claws into my hand.
"When'd you go to sleep last night?" "4 o'clock." "What? What were you doing up so late?" "Talking on the phone with my ex-boyfriend."
How did you get them?
No offense!
I've been a little distracted.
He was heartbroken from unrequited love.
How much is too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You make me nervous.
His rank isn't high enough for that position.
Are you hard of hearing?
This is where I belong.
You are my friends.
He is a carpenter by trade.
Tom isn't as naive as a lot of people think he is.
I punched his jaw.
We have two girls and one boy.
I'm taking my lunch break.
Was that man harassing you?
Fill out the form.
There wasn't anybody there.
Do you speak English?
Is that even a word?
You aren't Canadian.
I really am getting married.
Everyone told Tom no.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's so much to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We must face the facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's happening here.
Tom freaks me out.
Tom sleeps on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I could call a taxi for you.
You're in no danger.
What are my choices?
We've got to get them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
It made me feel close to Tom.
I don't want to bother them.
Tom was badly beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving and caused an accident.
I brought a couple of bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was extremely annoyed.
Why does Tom do it?
I have a job for you.
How do you form the plural of nouns?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
He gave me a bad cold.
It's gotten better.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't get mad at us.
Tom lowered his rifle.
Tom needs a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're really good.
That was a dirty trick.
We'll leave theory to the mathematicians.
Where's this from?
We're not done.
Tom wasn't put in jail for espionage.
Can we do anything to help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These small letters can only be read with a magnifying glass.
I can't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is an incisor.
We're here to help.
He is an army officer.
You were very brave.
I won't hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I can hear sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer reads 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anybody?
I will do as you say.
He would do whatever it takes to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say anything that you don't mean.
I decorated my room.
This is complete madness!
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Let Tom have his fun.
Our boat approached the small island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute. The wash is done. I'm going to hang out the laundry to dry.
Tom was a miner.
It's perfectly white.
I wish I had the will power to stay on a diet.
The person in question is now staying in America.
He is thought to be guilty.

This is the first time I've been here.
I hate that trumpet.
My eyes are tired.
I need to get away from her.

We're experienced.
Tom isn't looking very well.
I have a hump.
I'm being fired because I've been late to work a lot.
I was thinking I'd like to buy you a pair of earrings.
What'll Tom do now?
That's the spirit!
There's always a catch.
Your health is very important to me. Why don't you go to the doctor?
Spirit, are you there?
Nobody here smokes.
Is your freezer still working?
The town restored this old historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.

Get your paws off me.
Don't say that name around me.
Are you going to throw that away?

Those are my things.
Tom used to take a walk every day.
The exact same thing happened to one of my friends.
I no longer feel that way about you.
Tom isn't naughty.
Tom changed subjects.
We'll handle this.
That feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'm going to read this again.
Give me my glasses.

I know about him.
We've got the key.
Tom failed horribly.

It was tragic.
I can tell you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've asked everybody.
Driverless cars are now widely in use.
That's not my call.
I told the police that Tom was with me at that time.
He went out to eat.
Then there is a problem...
Tom is carrying some chairs.
No matter what you may do, you must do your best.
I'm no good for you.
It's brand new.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my snacks?
The organist was elderly.
I was playing tennis.
I think you should help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He sat next to her.
Why don't you do it like I showed you?
I'm making scrambled eggs.
I like blue.
The girl let the bird loose.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't put sugar in my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no porn of it, porn will be made of it.
I've been calling for hours.
She died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipes?
She got a proper telling-off.
What's it all mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine. I don't like it anyway.
I hope that's not what really happened.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and cut loose from her parents' control.
Tom is a big spender.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was performed in 2005.
I forgot where I put it.
Tom never said that.
You aren't invited.
You said you would text me in the evening, but you lied, evidently.
Make a guess.
She undressed to take a bath.
A waterfall of sweat began to pour down my face.
Mary renounced her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I want to study math.
A piano is expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you make out?
Movies are a great diversion.
At first, I couldn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
He made me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning to leave.
How many guests should we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
It seems I was wrong about him.
I appreciate your help on this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
Our plane was cancelled because of adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is an answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They may come back.
It's thundering outside. I'm really scared!
The committee are all against it.
The world is lightened by the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was totally wasted.
Wow, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport is close by.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom isn't frightened.
I've cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
This cork won't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to watch Mary.
Mary likes her coffee steaming hot, while Tom likes his lukewarm.
I gave her a fake address.
I took my shoes off.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance that Jane will come.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're going to need this.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
They started firing.
Tom started giggling.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
Why do I need a lawyer?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were those guys?
Tom began to talk.
Tom doesn't look so well.
I'm going to try real hard to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats anything.
Where does Tom shop?
It looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
All is quiet again.
It's a minor glitch.
I certainly hope so.
Take off your shoes.
I have a lot of problems at the moment.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Catch him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a brand new person.
Bring me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is whether he can do it or not.
Tom rushed upstairs.
Tom's going to kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
I have to tighten my belt.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't obey his parents.
I don't like Tom in there.
Let's go get a burger.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old kid.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston just last week.
I sleep standing up.
I am getting weaker and weaker!
That cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
I also feel the same way.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom going?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
Germans have a more relaxed attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom won't come back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's sleeping.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they placed his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept tips?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, who will?
I wish I could be more like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud clap of thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
I said open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I was very unlucky.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I made Tom very angry.
A week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'll be the one helping him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I always liked mysterious characters more.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I like eating pineapple for breakfast.
I meant to tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the greatest American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't disturb Tom.
Tom might never come back here again.
Nobody likes crybabies.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried climbing the distant mountain.
I missed the competition.
That was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom is quite crazy.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
The soap hurt my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'm happy to help.
Everything's quite informal.
This isn't the way.
I know I can do more.
You learn quickly.
We had a lovely meal.
Tom has been unemployed for three months now.
Tom doesn't have a lot to give.
I'm the one who got beat up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know that you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought scented garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He got used to working two hours every day in the garden.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while he was travelling in Africa.
We want to see it.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport has expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really cool.
How come you made such a mistake?
Your memory is good.
Can he do whatever he wants?
The time has come to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It sure is hot.
We have bad news for them.
We should head home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom wasn't the only one in the room that couldn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not fully aware of what has happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This one's a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Can you give us a lift?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yes, so?
I asked where Tom was.
You've been quite helpful.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come to save you.
There is a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We got dead drunk.
Who made the doll?
I never gave up hope.
Her long hair was chestnut brown.
I'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never pick fights.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We've barely begun.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office for him.
What is its purpose?
I want somebody else.
Don't speak.
They may need our help.
I've got some donuts.
I'm studying French.
Get out of my sight.
It was far too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls will not play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I've been careless.
Mary terminated our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wit.
We have to call Tom.
They're going to hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have supper.
You won't need that.
One day I strolled into the woods.
Let's give him some privacy.
I never wear suits.
The heater is broken.
He went away.
Majority of his clientele are poor people.
We've all been wrong.
Find the differences.
That's devastating.
Why's it bothering you?
Tom says he also wants to do that.
Women like men with moustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I care about them.
People are always dying.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call if there's trouble.
She's destroying her clothes.
He whipped out his sword.
I'm dying to go to Boston.
Tom reluctantly went.
Tom seems a bit depressed this morning.
Nobody understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where it was.
Tom got kicked by a mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in whatever form, is repulsive.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should've bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book. I need it again.
Marco thinks he writes well.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Tom isn't very neat.
Don't listen to him!
May I say something?
What a scoundrel you are!
Who makes breakfast for him?
I don't understand this song.
They call me captain.
Tom is insecure.
Tom wouldn't give in.
Tom got suspended.
They started kissing each other.
She will be a teacher.
I'm not about to tell Tom that.
I would like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems distraught.
Something's strange.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find succor in the nearest village.
We hope it's good.
You're competent but you're slacking.
He has worked in the embassy for three months.
School is over now.
We might have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll bring them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him any way I can.
Tom lost his temper.
It's work.
We'll manage it.
Praise stimulates students to work hard.
Tom isn't very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I disagree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom is about thirty.
What's the big deal?!
I can see how upset you are.
OK, I'll order it.
We'll sort it out.
I can get you a deal.
He's away on a trip.
Dan was assaulted by two people.
Tom weighed himself.
Something must've happened to Tom.
Tom has really changed a lot since last year.
I suppose I should go talk to Tom.
Tom was indignant.
Tom looks a bit shaken.
He's hammered.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title of lady was only used for noblewomen.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can you pick just one?
I came by to feed Tom's fish.
I'm here to help you, actually.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, lying on his bloody bed, with a dagger lodged deeply in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I got paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
I couldn't be more certain.
How long will you be staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so much fun.
Could you stay a minute?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're particular.
You should give him some space.
You just missed Tom.
Where's the mail box?
I hear your childish laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are plotting something.
Just let us be.
Tom is quite thin.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder rumbling?
Don't mix business with pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're OK.
Your zipper is open.
This is one of mine.
There's nothing to stop us.
Tom is perspiring.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't make Tom angry.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for some help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely correct.
Rats are small.
Please stay close by.
We're done talking.
I got you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm bored with Boston.
Tom had a bad headache.
From the moment he saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was riding in the back seat.
The bank loaned the company $1 million.
There's so much more I need to say to you.
I always take notes.
What're the terms?
Are you staying, Tom?
I know what you love and I'll do everything I can in order to destroy it.
Play in a more relaxed manner.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
It looks like I drank too much yesterday. My head is pounding. I'm completely hungover.
Tom enjoyed himself.
Tom said he couldn't remember that guy's name.
I'll have your baby.
It was fairly funny.
Tom pulled the door shut.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have any interesting books I could borrow?
Tom moved cautiously.
Just get inside.
He forged the steel into a sword.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied in the library yesterday.
I've had my say.
You're ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom blew his nose.
When will we meet?
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
Tom is only a child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom has indeed found something interesting.
We were outnumbered.
It'll be okay.
I can't believe you.
What was it Tom wanted to see?
I'm so afraid.
Dan flew into a rage.
I don't even know which one is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where I should put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's difficult to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll get him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy all these things for us.
I couldn't leave Tom to die.
Was Tom hospitalized?
You'll feel better.
These are the rules.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in two.
Aren't you fond of playing tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me in front of the post office.
What college do you study in?
It's a question of integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom isn't very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I thought it would.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just went inside.
A blood vessel broke in my eye.
Tom visited Mary yesterday.
You've gone too far!
I have a son who disappeared.
I'm trying to work.
What flavor do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch that the show will be cancelled; they haven't sold many tickets.
Tom is on his way.
Tom doesn't think that he needs to use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl went to sleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're ridiculous.
Tom paid me.
I like to read books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom appears awkward.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Today was very hot.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has faults.
Tom sat down behind the steering wheel.
What do we do about them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What do you see here?
I'm under the impression that it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
She already has a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she still said she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrifying.
Where does he live, generally? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for one moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep if the lights are on.
There is too much acid in this orange.

It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom is away on business.
Tom said that he'd water the garden.
Do you know how that could've happened?

Do you remember what you were wearing the first time I met you?
Lightning normally accompanies thunder.

This lesson is endless!
The glasses are in the glass cupboards.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn't French kiss him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.
We're concerned about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you.

She called the psychiatrist.
How come are you still not sleeping?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He is unable to do it.
Tom didn't have the courage to try doing it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love to each other.
I burned the trash.
We've both seen it.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a world-famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made myself clear.
I'm filling in for her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this amazing?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
As a matter of fact, I've gotten back with my old boyfriend.
Let's just get this done.
I think Tom is great.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom after?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't like to.
Your new guitar sounds good.
What does the sign over the door say?
Take a seat.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Maria.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them right now.
I got my shoes wet.
Tom would fight back.
She is always hard at work.
What country are you a citizen of?
Traffic in ivory is illegal.
I always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still some room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom can't swim yet.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages can you speak?
I know that you cared deeply for Tom.
I was home by myself.
I should've asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
It's unbearably hot.
It looks like those two have made up.
I'm afraid I can't authorize that.
I urgently need you.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We were broke.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I made this for you.
You're courageous, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not the way I wanted it.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you are awake.
Return to your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'm bringing Tom along with me.
I'm kind of a loner.
I can't cope with this task.
I guess I'll have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you weren't at his party?
I'm looking for them right now.
I'm not allowed to tell what you want to know.
They're both good.
Why are you going to Boston?
At first, I couldn't understand anything.
I went to a spa with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm searching for food.
Wood floats.
We'll be in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to disturb him.
Tom never stays long.
He walks on crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
They all talked.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom searched the kitchen drawers.
Many people in Africa were killed as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is Tom's photograph.
Could you call her?
Louder.
The forest was silent then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin condition.
She was depressed.
We're tempting fate.
I thought her boobs were bigger.
I might be ready to go soon.
Tom lacks empathy.
There's a little tea left in the pot.
I must have parked my car elsewhere.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise got on my nerves.
This is justified.
I didn't even know that you didn't like Tom.
I know a few things.
Was it all a dream?
I cannot sleep. I am just electrified by the knowledge of our imminent approach toward Pluto.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom disguised himself as a priest.
I'd like to see your warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
This is where Tom said he used to live.
Why's Tom like that?
I have sinus trouble.
I had little expectation for him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto is no one's property.
She handles a saw very well.
Turn it off.
I don't supply my real name to any Internet site.
He abandoned the plan.
I don't want to lie.
Time is not money. - Time is life.
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I am sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but apparently I was wrong.
I've got three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very nice.
The police are looking for me.
Tom is not so tall.
It's been raining for around a week.
He is slowly recovering from his illness.
I want a camomile.
He is too old to walk quickly.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom do the talking.
I know you still love Tom.
Back away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How can I reach Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of those people may be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the ceiling.
Her face was covered with cum.
Tom is fair.
This is what you need to do first.
I met him about noon.
I don't want to do anything tonight.
Get him something to drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is this ethical?
Do you know how that looks?
Pretend you've won.
I'm really confused.
They waited outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible. Thus, he was told to leave the company.
I'd understand anything coming from you.
Tom aspires to be a teacher.
Have a good week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
You only live once.
How many people are in the house?
Tom should leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why blame them?
They cost too much.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy doing this.
Tom walked upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I can't remember the question.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Now look what you've started.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
A nail punctured the tire.
We got dead drunk.
This is much better.
I'll have her mow your lawn.
Tom is good at math.
Tom emptied his bank account.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The heavier, the better.
You can take a break.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a disgrace.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know what that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You must forgive me.
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
The door has been forced.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think that she is strange because she is not just Caucasian.
She resolved not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's out back.
Dan wanted to find out where Linda had been the previous night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them some apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It's still not right.
Quote me an example.
I should certainly buy you a drink.
Should this happen again, call me.
Were you sincere?
The cup was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy here, aren't you?
They won't back off.
They're close.
Mum and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came back to life in his coffin.
No, I'm not angry with you.
She's our neighbour.
I've finished my work.
We'll handle them.
Please move quickly.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom has a black eye.
Tom's company is in trouble.
Have you ever done it?
Tom could be wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I stopped by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I take a hot shower, the mirror in the bathroom fogs up.
Tom took a picture.
Tom thought that Mary would be at John's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I'm afraid I don't have enough money on me at this time.
"Are you a vegetarian?" - "No, are you?"
Lightning struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped speaking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father had passed away.
They gave me another raise.
I will never set my foot there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I can walk.
I'm contributing.
It's a complete disaster!
Tom is good at his profession.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why my name was deleted from the list.
Tom orchestrated this whole thing.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is lukewarm.
Before that, there was no plant life in this region.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's reply?
You will do as I say.
Who's going to believe you?
Who are you going out with?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what was right.
Tom is miles away.
Tom likes writing.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
It is said that the old chapel is haunted.
Let's ask them something else.
Why is Tom's name not on the list?
Yes, so?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not used to it.
She has narrow hips.
I don't ovulate.
Maybe Tom isn't telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The great critic and the poet are traveling together.
There's no time for explanations.
Are they going to arrest me?
I'm afraid that violates every rule in the book.
What are you doing here? Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There is a Mr. Kimura on the line for you.
A man and a woman are people of different genders.
That's mostly right.
I know Tom cheated.
The wound discharged pus.
No, and it's not under the chair either.
I am a bit drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom covered his head with his pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did he look up?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom any money.
Our solar system is always in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom tossed the documents on Mary's desk.
Tom has done this.
I study art history.
I don't quite agree.
What's on the agenda?
I have a lot more.
It looks like those two have gotten back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still can't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They are outsiders.
Whether to translate is a moral choice of the translator. Sometimes things are better to be left alone in the language which produced them.
You're disgusting.
Tom avoids Mary whenever possible.
Before doing that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look gorgeous.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of nails.
I did it.
Have a look.
Hand me the wrench.
Tom appears nervous.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom isn't hopeful.
Tom wears glasses.
I'll continue working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
There was a great crowd at the party.
Since it is the oval track, the distance between the planets and the sun differs at times.
Tom was the one who told me.
Tom looked deeply into Mary's eyes and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room with all the windows closed.
Tom could get hurt.
All is good.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
Tom is Caucasian.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you in here, Tom.
It may be too late already.
You'd better find them.
I couldn't fall back to sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom steadied himself.
You'll be notified in due course.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman has had a child.
I really do like you.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't need to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, one doesn't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful to not say too much.
You are wandering.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom is cantankerous.
I just cut my finger.
I'll go and ask Tom.
My head aches.
I wouldn't advise it.
You only get one life.
Why does Tom have to leave?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Somebody might've followed her.
My wife has been here once.
That's powdered medicine.
He walked along the shore.
I don't want you to harass them.
It hangs on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom reacted badly.
Is Mike off the bottle?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very sharp.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her great-granddaughter.
That's our best hope.
I can smell flowers.
Tom started to choke.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
She's good at tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was murdered.
I need you for just a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourselves.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed hatred toward me.
I don't think they're capable of doing that.
I don't cry when I am happy.
I thought we agreed.
I'd like to help him prove it.
I find your arguments illogical.
Tom looks undecided.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he is wrong or I am.
My computer has frozen.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right over.
You forgot your backpack!
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.
You don't need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel is going to be a little pricey for you.
Tom lifted the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't get his trousers off.
I don't need to convince them.
What're you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were mistaken.
We are happy to see you.
You can go now, sir.
It might be him.
You're about to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen is giving off green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's your proof?
We woke to terrible news this morning.
The knee wound is now festering.
Dry your eyes.
Mary was afraid.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't comment.
Tom is a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seemed to be enjoying himself.
Tom might hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What do you eat, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't want to know either.
They're going to do it.
I'll have to stay here for the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get off here.
We're being paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel burst inside his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for your car?
Is she your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy person to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes running.
I need some nutmeg.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it's best if I stay here for a while.
Tom read the note again.
The children drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
I wondered what was taking you so long.
Did you get a reply from him?
I should get her home.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I've gone to Boston twice.
Tom got married at 26.
We've already settled that.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it is also not under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't feel it's appropriate.
Tom knows he hears something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come visit us soon.
Did you eat breakfast today?
What is this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She liked to boast about the magnificent chandeliers in her house.
I'm not from here.
What's on your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
Do you know what's happening right now?
Tom refused to tell us what had happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning piano.
They need the money.
He's good at swimming.
You're not going to find us.
I've heard from her.
You keep out of this.
Thank you for giving me the time I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came.
You aren't listening.
Do you think you're going to be able to stop me?
It's quite common actually.
I've decided to forgive them.
I know that you know.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles don't have four angles.
It's not light enough in here to read.
Tom confronted Mary.
Tom just listened.
Mary unscrewed her lipstick.
Why don't you guess?
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I looked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom asked about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone is waiting for her.
It might be risky.
I, too, am a teacher.
I thought Tom was going to be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we had fun.
Your moon returns.
Tom is wearing John's T-shirt.
He found his parents.
She gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's light.
Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
Tom looks astonished.
Tom was taken aback.
That's as it should be.
Let's try to get along.
That'll be difficult.
I don't like being retired.
Thanks for asking.
I've got a good reason not to like Tom.
It gave me an idea.
May I begin to eat?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Get him to call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
That girl who's wearing a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer is on his way.
I don't think Tom will put up much of a fight.
What are you grinning about?
I'll get them right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We've had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince succeeded to the throne.
You're not going to find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know it for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
There's no urgency.
I'm going to go get her now.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll come by subway.
I never got an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom'll come.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom drives to school.
Were you watching?
I have to think this over carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone is talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing the proverbs?
It was a great show.
We'd better go find them.
I haven't been home on a Friday night since I was thirteen.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're concerned about them.
You always forget.
Take off your cap.
I don't know what you think is going to change.
I'm doing it for him.
You can believe her.
Do you have injuries?
It wasn't my idea.
It's been nothing but trouble.
What's Tom up to now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom must be angry.
Tom will be asleep.
Let us protect our peace!
Tom is heavily armed.
We've been worried.
I forgot to tell you what time the meeting's going to start.
I forgot my password.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I had a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom made it on time.
TV's boring today.
Oh! Marvelous!
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
It might not just be a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to greet them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors are subject to inspection.
What's that scar from?
You're a nobody.
We're not going to find them.
The society was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally legit.
It's so cool!
The water perforates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write it down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
I happen to like a challenge.
He is not sitting on a bench.
I should've done that yesterday.
Tom is a lot like me.
Tom isn't my cousin.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
It's just imaginary.
Tom didn't talk to Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming about you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me it's OK.
Let's take a rest.
I'm sure he'll pass the coming exam.
We're on our way to Boston.
Tom is a good father.
Stay right here, OK?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately on the lips.
Tom drove to the store and bought three cans of insect spray.
It was disgusting.
You owe me nothing.
Tom transformed himself into a werewolf.
I bought these medicines for my father.
Children love cake.
Bill is quite reserved.
I can deal with Tom.
Tom became frustrated.
This is from us.
In case of an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I never touched it.
Who's in command here?
He confessed he had to lie.
Mary took Tom for every cent he had.
Cut the nonsense.
By the way, Mike, please tell me how to get to your house.
Tom had always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started whining.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
That might not be as hard as you think it's going to be.
We'd like to order 18 tonnes of olive oil.
Tom left work early.
We have everything.
I baked these cookies for him.
When is school over?
You've been right all along.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the rail.
These must be fake.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend has lost weight.
I'm through with Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom is always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom woke from his nightmare, screaming.
Tom has bad eyesight.
The flash wasn't working, so he couldn't take a picture in the dark.
We agree to start at once.
Is it done?
Everyone wants continuous peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom took off the blindfold.
The tribe wasn't delighted about the advent of the peacemaker.
Open up.
Put on your apron.
You could be wrong.
At the same time, I baked a cake.
Tom owns a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which classes to take.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
Try not to worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Nobody's in the classroom now.
It didn't come up.
I can't believe that Tom is the one who stole Mary's bicycle.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say anything you want me to.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room below?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom is a nice man.
I never change my sleep cycle.
Well, what's in the box?
She sat on the bench.
Everybody, come here.
Have you watched it?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worse that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you've seen here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I framed Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We'll miss Tom a lot.
I'm fairly certain that Tom has never done anything like that before.
You're very sharp.
I just thought I'd mention it.
Is it just me, or is Tatoeba extremely slow today?
Have you googled me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom is probably in the kitchen.
Tom is himself again.
It serves you right.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you men want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back till dinner time.
Tom has betrayed you.
I should get packed.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
I ate too much today.
My favorite music is pop music.
Half an hour passed.
I'm waiting for him to return.
That was impressive.
I can't see a thing.
He's quite an unpleasant fellow!
They pitched their tent on the beach.
I never wanted that.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took off the picture on the wall and hung another there.
Freeze!
Do you like cheese?
I'll call her for you.
He gets tired easily.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are anything but bright.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's punctured.
I'm helping Tom out with something.
I got mad.
Go get your hair cut.
Worrying is a waste of energy.
Tom went into rehab.
They'll be well paid.
Tom has likely gone out.
We weren't fighting.
Tom peeked inside.
You are difficult and easy, pleasant and bitter at the same time; I can't live with or without you.
Let's say for the moment that you're right.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear a word.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'm going to see you later.
It's warm in here.
It disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom is a pushover.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You've been missed.
Would you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They're all alike.
Don't forget him.
We've got to find them first.
I'm keeping count.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a skillet.
Tom will kill you.
We'd both better get some sleep.
I always get those two names confused.
Tom is wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very sloppily written.
You're supposed to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He wrote a book, and an excellent one at that.
Tom turned the knob.
This better be good.
If they lied about that, we've got a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more sad than stupidity and apathy.
They're all grinning at them.
Tom didn't protest.
What causes websites to lag?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She is a young university student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate tomatoes.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day shoveling snow.
His paralysis is progressing, and soon he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
I'm being paid to help you.
This jacket is too small for me.
I was fired.
I asked Tom if he could have it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I have no objections.
We're at home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you as happy as you want to make me.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll do that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on the way to work.
You're very sharp.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
Tom will be there as well.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't make me wait!
It was Tom who gave me the painting hung on the chimney.
The dove symbolizes peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You traitor!
I'll do anything in the interests of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enya’s music is good.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be going deaf.
That's over now.
I'm beginning to get sleepy.
A connection between personality and blood type has not been scientifically proven.
She sounded mad.
Frankly, Tom didn't try hard enough.
He comes from England.
Does anyone disagree?
That's the part I don't like.
I think Tom is courageous.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom is a hairdresser.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on the computer.
Perhaps you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We looked all over for them.
I really like your website.
I'm going to get you.
Push the button here.
Tom can really fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom totaled his car.
You must overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards can lay eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom is harsh.
He didn't reply to my letter.
We calmed down.
You seem disoriented.
The bread's baking in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad. Did you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I can see which way the wind's blowing.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move over to that table.
Hang on just one moment.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to the one I have.
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
Please step outside.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a shed.
Many trees fell down.
Lions are colorblind.
That wasn't right.
The answer's tricky.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We are very far from home.
Friendship lasts longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money now.
Tom believed in Mary's innocence.
He has too much pride.
I'm having a wonderful time here in Vancouver.
Perhaps we shouldn't be trying to do this without Tom's help.
Could I give you a hand?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess both of us were lying.
I've been happy here.
Few passengers survived the accident.
I could see you marrying Tom.
Tom seems courteous.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I've missed you a lot.
I'm shorter than you.
I will quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows ruminate?
Pus is coming out of my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't know how to speak French.
These received no names.
It's fair.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anybody else ever did love you.
We packed their suitcases for them.
What kept you up last night?
They cursed us.
Did you receive Tom's invitation?
Just give him a call.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your benefit.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They are eating a sandwich.
Turtles live to a great age.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom is a very sound sleeper.
Are you helping him?
She looks as if she were drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
I do remember it.
Did you come here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over for us.
I am sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're with friends.
You're looking thin.
I know you can't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make the decision.
They're going to find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thanks for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer quail eggs.
Can you explain that?
Where is his house?
Love is for lunatics.
Why should I help him?
Tom shined his shoes.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom is shaking hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
How is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I bothering you?
End violence; pursue peace.
Watch how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hang in there, Tom.
You're so helpful.
Tom can't talk to us yet.
They'll love that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what we can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick. It is time for dinner.
I'm getting confused.
You were speeding.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had one daughter.
Tom might at least apologize.
He sucks up to his boss.
The next morning he found a handwritten letter in the letterbox.
Come inside.
Is this seat taken?
I have to reduce my expenses this month.
Nobody talks about us.
I think you're overstating the problem.
Have you already paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom rubbed his face.
What use are you to me?
Let's take a closer look.
I like you better.
We don't have to follow her.
He turns me on when he wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They live on the floor below.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't attend his wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he doesn't understand.
I've got to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
A dolphin is a mammal species.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom is making fun of you.
I think I'll go out to eat.
He opened the door, though I told him not to.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
Tom requested that we take care of his child.
I put an underline under the word "Alice" to put an emphasis on it.
Third time's the charm.
We need to get away.
This puff pastry is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let's strive after virtue and give up vice.
You're a sharp one.
I am against this project.
Weren't you tired?
I know the problem.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I arrived too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is quite harmless.
I've got some reports to write.
I have a pain here.
You're making Tom nervous.
Where are we heading?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing.
Tom never turned up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish this tomorrow.
You've missed a button.
Illness can often occur at a very inconvenient time.
This dog is staring at me as if it wanted to eat me.
They were beasts in human skins and not true man at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is perishable, but the good memories live.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really sweet.
Everybody dies eventually.
I know how to keep my cool.
We love beauty.
I think about her all day.
I suggest we concentrate on finding a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote another check for Linda.
That's right, folks!
The building is a monstrous structure.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did that intentionally.
I received this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying above the clouds.
I love it!
Is this good English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has sail-like ears.
Give her a chair.
Where is your school?
Tom sat by himself.
How is your wife doing?
Tom didn't quite know how to respond to the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary was going to say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
It should be possible to do that.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not inflexible.
Tom's harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom backed off.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are wormy.
We might find something.
You look pretty good.
You've made Tom unhappy.
Heat it up.
Tom looks dismayed.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become both physically and mentally stronger.
She is a lively girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please stop walking.
There is no hot water.
I bought you a kite.
Tom sounded upset.
They started walking.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't even think it.
"I got nine on my chemistry test. And you?" "The same."
You were lucky to survive the attack.
Tom seemed to be in no hurry.
Tom was talkative.
How was the dance?
I am a student.
It fits perfectly.
I can see why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I dislike being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day we met.
You always leave your bike filthy.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's go to lunch.
I guess I was stupid to expect you to do anything.
You are my pride and joy.
What were you going to say?
Form two lines.
Headlines are supposed to grab the reader's interest.
He sat in front of me.
I would rather die than submit.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anybody.
I like your outfit.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew that it was a bad idea.
My mother says that the child's illnesses are phony.
Dan had a very stormy relationship with Linda.
They all went back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us.
Perhaps Tom can sing at our wedding.
Which would Tom choose?
The hospital there is not huge.
Most people have to work for their livelihood.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is eating for two now.
We're staying.
I'm not petting their dog.
I didn't sleep well.
I am a lover of liberty. I will not and I cannot serve a party.
Girls begin puberty around the ages of ten to eleven, and boys around the ages of eleven to twelve.
She's on a roll.
Tell Tom that he needs to make sure he doesn't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon clear.
This wall feels cold.
He thought someone had put poison in his soup.
Many people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was well-dressed.
It was really cheap.
Marriage frightens some people.
Was the door closed?
I have a huge sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals such as snakes, for example.
We need leaders.
It is his first day of school.
Don't dawdle on the way home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What kind of book are you reading?" "A novel."
Your car's on fire.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
Half the species are woman.
They're staring at him.
That's for them.
Those are Tom's dogs.
Where is the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
How is the weather?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk about me.
I want to work as a volunteer to make amends for everything I've done.
Tom tied his laces.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's great.
This sentence allows for multiple interpretations that I had to consider when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are wasps poisonous?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're wrong, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary was very supportive.
Tom is now in danger.
I give you my word.
Who'll pay the rent?
You're sort of rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I waited outside for you.
I want my money back.
Tom isn't interested.
Tom wanted Mary to drive John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom has good manners.
You've seen what I can do.
We have plenty money.
Do you look your age?
Can we have a menu, please?
All is not milk and honey in Canada.
I have some information regarding this.
Tom is glum.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They aren't stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom doesn't trust anyone else to do it.
He has poor eyesight.
That's my specialty.
I try not to worry about you.
I had a speech ready.
The falcon has sharp eyes.
I wrote that for them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom honked the horn.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom laughed politely.
That teapot's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom has lost weight.
They took a walk.
This is his maternal grandfather.
I want specific information.
Friendship is magic.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he has a few things to take care of.
How does that help?
Dan likely smothered Linda until she died.
The small island looked like a tortoise from a distance.
Are the trout biting?
What did you ask Tom?
Please stop embarrassing yourself.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is far from being perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't have much time left.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go see a movie.
Handsome women age far better than pretty women.
Tom has sheep.
He tripped him up.
Mary felt her face grow hot.
I know what's making Tom so nervous.
I thought Tom had retired.
Tom missed it.
Please come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Quit following them.
Tom is kind of shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
It doesn't bother me.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom is overreacting.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking your figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She works from nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts tremendously here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he'd left his umbrella.
Move out of the way.
I'm going to get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's finished.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom is never going to finish the job he started.
Tom has been a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You were wrong about the painting.
I'll bring her.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom is replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
You're one sharp cookie.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
They're all grinning at him.
Faith consists in believing what reason cannot.
Tom kept me company.
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn't help him.
You're throwing away your entire life.
I can't imagine a world without music.
I live pretty close to here.
There's a button on the inner side of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The spruce returns.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick a weapon.
They have elected a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "OK, I'll dry then."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's lagging behind.
We value our customers.
We have to abide by the rules.
That is a circus!
Tom is wet.
They demanded a salary increase.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know that Tom would be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom isn't here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I would love to have had lunch with you.
What is it you need, Tom?
He was about to talk.
The heater has quit working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Throw down your weapons.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought those books for them.
That's very possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
Everything's running like clockwork.
It was a terrific experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He is playing.
Tom asked me whether I liked his plan or not.
The fan doesn't work.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Am I clear?
I've had a busy day.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father is suffering from influenza.
I haven't been waiting so long.
Just look at yourself.
This is magnificent.
A space is missing before the colon.
Tom lives on this street.
You ought to see a dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They obeyed.
Tom stepped outside.
This is all I can do.
He sticks to his principles.
Tom is infuriated.
I'm only here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I can still remember the first time I saw you.
It's been dismantled.
Tom is very stingy.
Could I place this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'm driving you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom isn't buying this at all.
I asked around about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm thinking of going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He wriggles like an eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the rubbish in the barrel.
I'm happy to ride with Tom.
It's that time again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom sat at his desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't speak so fast.
You go and get Tom and then come back here.
I see no conspiracy there.
I will give you what little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday evening.
Take off your mask.
That's certainly one possibility.
You may go anywhere.
I'm making a fool of myself.
I liked your dancing.
I need you a second.
We've been tricked.
Tom is the real deal.
Tom looks frightened.
The police will investigate that case.
Now you've ruined it.
She's Caucasian.
Grab a seat.
Iron is harder than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became abusive.
When does the performance begin?
Could I just talk with you?
We're not about to let you die.
My shoes are chafing my feet.
Tom never said anything about that.
It's probably right.
We had to walk home in the rain.
I like being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he has no friends.
Every colour has a meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
It just doesn't feel safe.
I'm out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I messed up.
It made me strong.
The response is affirmative.
We knew you'd come.
I live in the city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How will I find it?
The ice has melted.
I coughed up blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I am afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee.
I'm always up early.
You must be deeply relieved.
I never got caught.
I love my homeland.
I never learned how to write.
They stopped walking.
Tom can handle that.
Don't jinx me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom never answered my question.
The room was locked.
I can't excuse her.
Tom stole from me.
Victory is bitter.
They are looking at themselves in the mirror.
I don't usually cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom escorted Mary to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
The two of you are in cahoots against me!
I've never worn a sleeping gown in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a smoke?
The children are asleep upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't do too badly.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm rather proud of it.
Try staying out of the way.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'm sending Tom home.
What are you guys talking about anyway?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught a fish.
Staying home is boring.
It isn't that bad.
They're going crazy.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won't be worth the wait.
I have to buy a new rug for the room.
Tell Tom to write me.
Do you like going to work?
I couldn't stand it.
Today it's sunny but cold.
What's it all about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to be an opera singer.
Give us any help you can.
Tom ran downstairs.
Tom made a promise.
Tom and Mary hit it off from day one.
Let's kiss.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure that it was Tom who made this.
"Aren't you going to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favourite subject.
Tom lost some weight.
You drive me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come out and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe with you.
Tom started singing.
Tom isn't so tall.
She is wearing a leather belt around her waist.
They fought the fire.
They finally left.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I'll go and look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't like using dildos, I prefer real cocks.
I won't cook for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a psychiatrist.
Tom gave a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can stay only if you are quiet.
I want to find out what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
Don't fight.
I expect your help.
Tom will go alone.
Tom got straight A's in school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are pure.
Tom talked too much.
My brother is out.
You were terrific.
I'd like to be able to tell people my real name.
The dentist put in a temporary filling.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom has hay fever.
They contacted their local politicians.
Tom is taking notes.
I was given this ticket.
We will have a discussion concerning the prognosis.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove a thing.
May I eat this apple?
How long's it been since Tom died?
Tom is odd.
That was really nice.
My dad gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
I heard you don't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Tom might know how to speak French.
Tom cut my hair.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with your elbow, isn't it?
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
What games do you like to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over to our place and help us move our piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It has cooled off.
I tossed and turned all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're going crazy.
He really turns me on.
I can go anyplace I want.
Tom was often bullied in school.
When does it begin?
The bear bites itself.
Tom walked across the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to leave?
Tom steadied himself.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom has always been able to get what he wants.
I suspected as much.
Tom isn't doing what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither friend nor foe. It is simply indifferent.
We've done what we can for her.
You need to buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do then?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in this market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than it had been.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can get Mary to smile.
Can't you bring down the price a bit?
I'm going to go wash up first.
Tom is thirty now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a great-great-grandmother just days before turning ninety-nine.
Have you looked everywhere?
The important thing to remember is that no one is ever one hundred percent anything.
He gestures when he speaks.
Sit by me.
Tom is fascinated.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm genuinely happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. Because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his imprisonment under house arrest.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more have a longer life than those that have been hit by a truck.
I often converse with her.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom pruned the tree.
The ground is still wet. As likely as not, the game will be cancelled.
I was getting sleepy.
What a collection!
Everyone has a name.
Have you ever sucked a penis?
The dog followed me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom has gone.
She aspired to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's get this done.
We're sophisticated.
I've wasted my money.
I think that's ridiculous.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the bog.
I can give her a message.
She blushed slightly.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom has had too much to drink.
I have some questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood silently.
I collect postcards.
This time tomorrow, we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
This room looks like a pigsty.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom does sloppy work.
We don't have to go.
I am talking with Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he feels like it.
I'd rather not discuss her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him in peace.
I know that already.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are sweet.
That's not relevant.
I like comic books.
You have really good handwriting.
The wind continued.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Was I talking to you?
Seed pods keep dropping off the tree.
Did you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the class to be silent.
It needs to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
What's the fastest way to get to the post office from here?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's nothing serious.
Everything made Tom laugh.
I set out early so as to catch the first train.
Do you still dance?
Listen carefully. You need to know this.
Are you going in costume this year?
I'll do as you wish.
I'm not feeling so hot myself.
Do you wish to speak to me?
If there is such a thing as an unforgivable act, it is the act of not forgiving.
The door creaked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did he respond to the news?
Where did Tom say he'd gone?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm pining for him.
He's relaxing at home.
I'm not sure I've got it right.
Tom noticed Mary looking at him.
Stop pressuring me.
Ask him to explain it.
It's still functioning.
Tom is a nice person.
The eagle is king of birds.
Let me call you back.
This is extortion.
Shouldn't you take a break?
You never asked why.
Tom didn't sound as enthusiastic as Mary.
Let me talk to you.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky cleared up.
The noise is going to wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.
That's not really something one would need to prepare for.
Tom and Mary are playing Gin rummy.
I made my decision.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'm calling security.
Tom thought you'd prefer a blue one.
How did you come here?
He picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He is very kind, just like you.
I'll go do that.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked until two.
I learned about you from him.
I know that you're upset right now.
He is on a roll.
The long walk gave him a good appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom helped himself to a cup of coffee and a donut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way to get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do that, but Tom told me not to.
They both laughed again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed danger.
He's addicted to porn.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
You hair is a mess.
Tom is the tallest boy in his class.
Tom, you've grown so fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would've cared.
Have you written in your diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is this radio yours?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the keyhole, but couldn't see anything.
I couldn't bear it.
I have known the deceased for a long time.
We can't go into that now.
Why are you limping?
Go on ahead, Tom.
I'm going to try real hard to get there on time.
No one came up here.
I know there's something here.
Dirty drinking water can cause sickness.
We're about ready.
Tom has good hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't do it.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
He dislikes me.
Tom stole your money.
The cork would not come out.
I helped him clear the table.
I had steak and potatoes last night.
Taking the stairs is better for your health.
Tom bought a coat.
We have them sedated.
Your religion is ugly.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
I wouldn't ask you to do it if I could find anyone else.
Pick me up at 2:30.
Tom started drinking.
I slept on the boat.
I kind of enjoyed doing that.
That just might work.
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
Tom is the greatest.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is seldom late.
He didn't respond to my question.
Do you know of any good Japanese movies to watch?
Did you catch them?
Originally, French was slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We've baked some cakes for them.
The fingerprints on the knife attest to her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can look it up.
Go and find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked some cookies for you.
That can be done.
Italian politicians make me mad.
Maybe I should give them a hand.
I forwarded the schedule you sent me to Tom.
It isn't expensive.
It's really unfortunate.
Too many books to read is a good thing.
We would have had fun if we had gone to the party.
We were saved by the bell.
He hit me on the head.
You must be cautious.
Tom seems stunned.
Having fun keeps you young.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean, you don't know that?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can be here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat smells bad.
Am I supposed to know you?
Tom carefully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's ill.
It's wild guess.
She is a slow runner.
How could you be so sure?
In the photo, some bottles with different types of vegetable oils are seen.
They are living in misery.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't like swimming.
We just had Tom's room painted last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin like most vampires.
I would sell this dog if it was taller.
I'm off to help my friends.
Dan proved to be of no help.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a bum.
We detest her.
You arrived there before them.
Here, bro, halfsies.
Tom put the new tablecloth he had just bought on the table.
Tom is going to help Mary.
Dan grew up at an orphanage.
Tom is frustrated.
The scenery is breathtaking.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
The freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the victory with wine.
We don't have a week.
I'll try to control myself.
Autumn is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Are you the one who caused the accident?
It takes only three minutes for the water to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You are drunk!
It was quite spectacular.
Dan dated Linda for a very short period of time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enrol in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have one friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
Which one is the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen it work?
This soup is too salty.
Why don't you go get him?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost anything to repair it.
Is that a yes or no?
Tom peered down the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend? Can't you see that I'm a wretch?
It looks familiar.
I envy her.
I offered him a blowjob, but he said that he wasn't in the mood.
There's somebody in the tunnel.
There is a limit to everything.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a very perceptive person.
Everything looked OK.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I'm not paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound like enough.
I'll go to the park.
You will find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew I couldn't trust Tom.
I can keep a secret.
I don't like to run.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
I work out.
She might have fooled you, but she won't fool me.
Let's just get out of here.
Forget what I said.
Give him all of it.
I don't give a fuck, not even a flying one.
Tom reached into the sack and pulled out some coins.
The room is a mess.
Solving this problem is simple.
They had to remove a bullet lodged near his spine.
It's a lot of fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If possible, this weekend.
I know how it must sound.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm very sorry, but I seem to have lost your parasol.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're OK.
You apparently haven't known the pain of catfish sting.
We import grain from the United States.
This is how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need some paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom is absent because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
Windscreen wipers haven't any utility against ice.
I was lovely.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What is it that you'd like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess asking Tom to help is out of the question.
My brother arrives tomorrow morning.
You do not need to like everything.
Is eating potatoes fattening?
They'll get one soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom yanked Mary's ponytail.
I broke a vase today.
That's my concern.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky because he didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
It's a no-brainer.
I like to make faces at him.
I waited outside for her.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and telephone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thanks for helping us.
What's Tom so mad about?
Tom will be here several days.
I hope we are the last.
They stood under the canopy in front of the store, so as to avoid the rain.
I can think of several reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were thin.
Tom never knew that Mary had cancer.
It was my mistake.
I've been hired to find them.
They haven't found her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was determined.
He didn't go there.
I ought to break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us could help him.
I'm going to check in on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
Everyone hesitated.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found that there's a movie called "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!"
I want you to help her.
You are one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom isn't yet able to write his own name.
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
It is on me.
How many days are there before Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I don't do that well.
Tom has a collection of Matryoshka dolls.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice carry the plague.
I'll call him in a few minutes.
Tom started grinning.
I begin tomorrow.
I haven't been honest with myself.
I've been searching for you.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not see the end of the monarchy coming.
Tom freaks me out.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while he was driving and caused an accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was absolutely amazing.
Tom greets Mary by waving his hand.
That's okay.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't be too alarmed.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It snowed last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French fairly well.
You should be careful not to do too much.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, let alone German.
Getting down this mountain will take about three hours.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Have you finished packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is in recovery.
Why would Tom do it?
Who are you there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get crazy.
I won't assist you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The president announced that the United States would put a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend this book to you.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I wanna be cuter.
Tom gave me a hint.
Am I too early?
It sounds really cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old school.
Is this appropriate?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it there, Tom.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
I can't shut it down.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You really are good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not rational.
American women didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what had happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very frank.
Did you give him that dog?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the hype was about?
Tom wandered off somewhere.
I won't be a second.
The alarm started ringing.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive.
Are there any objections?
Tom lay on his back.
Where's the toilet?
I'll stay right here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's an unquestionable fact.
Does that taste good?
Look out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom cringed a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom is resigned to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is more like Bogotá and Osaka is more like Medellín.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'll get it.
Ruminants are a group of mammals.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, push the button.
I cook soup in a big pot.
If I met Jesus, I'd check out his abs.
We can do nothing for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where is the ox going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
When an adult tells a lie to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very amusing, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom took a screwdriver out of the tool chest.
Grab the rope.
I hope that you will enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his arms.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom pushed open the screen door.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'm going to make everything.
Tom proceeded to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't enjoy riddles.
This book will help you write effectively.
This region is located in a valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston in my place.
Please air the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he saw Mary earlier this morning.
I like to spread honey on my toast in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
This area is extremely isolated.
Presumably, the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to gather strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go and help them.
It's not ridiculous.
You'll get them back.
Tom's girlfriend threw him out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the gauge.
I'm impressed by your design.
You said to call anytime.
What is that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn everything off.
Tom started to choke.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hello, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I will lose weight.
It's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
Tom can help you as well.
I wonder why we got married.
What help is that?
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
He has invited me to attend his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
I saw nothing at all.
"How are you?" "Fine, thank you."
Mary was such a lovely bride.
Tom ought to be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a tongue-twister.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We did nothing wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you dump me?
I don't like spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were dumbfounded.
You are not Japanese.
Tom has many good qualities.
Get with the others.
Well, that's all right.
You should eat more.
Tom is bad at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I don't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to make amends.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this one.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'll say.
I'm no match for you.
The company laid off five people.
I should sue him.
Tom has been here.
We're not friends.
Where is the mailbox?
The Internet is serious business.
Mars is the Red Planet.
He threw a stone at a dog.
Tom stared intently.
It's already 7:00.
I'm curious.
We can try.
As if you actually wrote this book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not get cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We needed Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How do we help?
In order to get the soil ready for planting you must plow it.
Tom isn't well today.
We're not watching.
Mahmud abhors being idle.
Nobody can hear you.
OK, I'm convinced.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and laziness are siblings.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
I tore my pants.
I asked them what was wrong.
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I would fly to you.
I said yes.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live next to a dam.
You're all cowards.
It isn't wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard about us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom is beyond hope.
It's just up ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help find Tom.
We are almost there.
I realized I still hadn't eaten anything.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
Your things are all here.
Stay as long as you wish.
Just take my hand.
I shouldn't have believed her.
Who would know that?
I can't go into that.
Tom knows many celebrities.
He is very meticulous in his work.
Come over to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I do remember you were in Boston for a short while.
How many sit-ups should I do a day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and see a film?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is utter nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan was disguised as a beggar.
You have very piercing eyes.
Doesn't that go without saying?
I thought you looked tired.
How long should I wait?
Take Tom downtown.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Are you going back to work?
I'll soon be with you.
Finish the cigarette and then come inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems to be rich.
Tom seems dependable.
Do you want a drink of water?
Tom isn't friendly.
However, the quantity is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I wish to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to be at his party.
A square has four angles.
I continued working.
They got addicted.
Would you like me to go with you?
We'll meet you there.
Would you please check those?
Give them a second.
They sat in silence.
Bring a shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary takes after her mother.
Choose one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
Do you want me to pick up anything at the supermarket?
The mass is over.
Tom wiped the blade of his knife on his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I could make that happen.
Do your gums bleed?
Just have her call me, OK?
Tom put his mug of beer on the counter.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I knew how to speak French.
She gave me a sexy look.
Come on. Don't be shy.
I'd rather not eat the meat from an animal that was cloned.
How far did you go?
My dad is very strict.
Perhaps I could come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy you another one.
Are you coming down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Tell me how that's possible.
He looked sharply at me over his spectacles.
Linda accused Dan of stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is sturdy.
I just need a break.
I have a delivery for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Yours is over there.
We didn't mean for that to happen.
This is highly unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave.
I need to get us out of here.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could've broken the fishbowl?
I lost my patience.
Tell me why I'm here.
Tom has battled depression at various periods in his life.
Can I take your bags?
I'd trust you with my life.
I'm sort of hungry.
I'll give it a shot.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class went wild.
There were penguin footprints in the sand.
Tom has just left.
Dan called for a tow truck.
I like to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Scoot over.
I don't speak fast.
We need to talk face to face.
Tom isn't impressed.
I'm not even sure I like him.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope your new boss likes you.
Did she mention the results of the exam?
If you want quality, pay for it.
Tom was munching on something.
She studies English.
With such a vivid imagination he'll become either a world-famous novelist or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They begin beating her.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our siblings.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit out his gum.
Let's do it my way.
I got something for them.
Mom, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easily one acquires bad habits!
She has started acting strangely.
In all probability, the money will not be paid.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she became interested in archeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What should we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
I'm as strong as you.
The president seemed strong.
What should I buy?
Tom walked to the window and looked out.
His mobile has been stolen.
I'm sad.
I'm in Boston all this week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were a better chess player than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy spoke about the issue.
Yesterday I came here.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me out.
We tried to get them to come.
I won't say it again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything could happen.
You're prejudiced.
You ran as fast as you could.
Is Tom back?
Tom has a stiff neck.
Seize the day.
What's Tom rambling on about?
He is very handsome.
Let the buyer beware.
Tom often cuts class.
Now it's time to make amends.
Most virgins have an intact hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you fry two sausages only?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Since the bus had been delayed, we had a long wait in the rain.
You can handle it.
Does she have a dog?
I feel like a rest.
Mary wore false eyelashes.
This is how I did it.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was better at French than he really was.
How long do I have?
It's almost summer.
Mary did not understand the lecture. The speaker should have spoken more slowly.
It looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes got wet.
That medication calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please take the job.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look foolish.
His mother is American.
Relax for a minute.
Is Tom fun?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The Sphinx began to walk around him.
We need your help finding her.
There's mold on the bread. This means that we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom did a lousy job.
Tom shut the drawer.
Tom seemed annoyed.
Please tell them what they need to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't obey your boss blindly.
I've been looking for him.
It works fine.
Tom got really sick.
Is there anyone here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here for him?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheeses to cheeses from cow milk.
We understand that.
How is it different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy products for a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having a great time?
I was up all night.
Tom and I have some unfinished business.
Has that happened to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was spooky.
Carpenters cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Open your mouth wide.
Same-sex couples should be able to get married.
The cow forgot that it once was a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is manual work.
Let's go and see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to hear about it.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
Let me try that.
Would you please put out your cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would you believe her?
Who's that girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was at home then.
Don't push me around.
See you later, OK?
I live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies beget more lies.
I'm all out of money.
This chair is plastic.
Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She is always cold-hearted.
Be serious.
Tom knew that he couldn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was a big help.
He stood me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
After lunch today, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The light turned red.
John is at the airport.
Tom should have been ready at least an hour ago.
Suffer pangs of conscience.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm exceeds all description.
I'm working tomorrow.
How much did you bid?
We need it now.
I don't know why you're here.
Blood circulates through the body.
I will make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
It won't do any good to lie about it.
The big toe on my right foot hurts.
Apples are good for you.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I've got to get them presents.
What would the prince like?
Where do we come from? Where are we going?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom craves attention.
Dan didn't have any empathy whatsoever to any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I give her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at that drawing.
Stone was used to build their houses.
Yes, I said that, but I was wrong.
I don't think we should be talking about this right now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I cannot speak English, much less Spanish.
What're you doing with this?
No one will bother you.
Tom never really thought about those kinds of things.
It's windy.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.

Those pajamas are too big for you.
We're turning back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal. That's, on one hand, good news because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
I find them very easy to talk to.
Tell me where I can find him.

That's really great.

What do you see now?

Wash up.

Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
May I eat something?
They passed away and left me.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and look after her.
Wouldn't that make you tear your hair out?
How will you get away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg is broken.
Can you make that happen?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested in seeing the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That very thing happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I wondered who it was.
I think he is right.
What do you do here?
That's what's wrong.
It's in peak condition.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom obeyed.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.

As Tom said, this soup is too salty.
Have I missed much?
Why didn't you stop?
Are you coming outside?

What Tom did was a mistake.

Just do what you want.
It is OK for me to use that?

What's this about?
You'll have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should've asked them first.
Tom might be a little overweight.

All I want is money.
I don't say nasty things about their children.

It's in a safe place.

April fools!

How do you think Tom died?
I've decided to stay where I am.
I thought you'd be hard at work.
Open Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I take the picture with or without flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was on.
Give them a chance.
Let us help her.
Tom is in Australia.
I don't think that I'll be able to solve this problem by myself.
They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.
Could you give them a minute?
Tom is an adult now.
We do not sell alcoholic drinks or cigarettes to people under the age of eighteen.
I took the bus back.
Here's how we do it.

Maybe it was a cat.
The battle doesn't seem to be nearing an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom is wide awake.
I forgot to tell Tom who was going to pick him up at the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom isn't kidding.
Did you touch something?
Let's just do it now.
Let me talk with Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in an accident, but you're going to be all right.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our fun.
I can make it happen.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I'll be back in a few months.
It's advisable to check whether there'll be any adverse affects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you've been prescribed.

This is the first time I've ever put pepper on my eggs.
I'll manage.
That medicine worked.
Tom knows how to play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The ruler is short.
I've had it with Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to get you someplace where I know you'll be safe.
How long did you live there?
I don't know why you don't like her.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wants me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom evidently was here early this morning.
Get up already, you lazybones!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's house.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd stay away from Tom for a while.
I'm not waiting to find out.
Now, why don't we continue this conversation outside.
You can easily identify Tom because he is very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to make sure he had no internal injuries.
I feel like I let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's going to hurt you?
I got stuck.
You're with Tom, aren't you?
This orange is really delicious.
I sort of like him.
I love golf.
Nobody really wants us.
It's extremely rare.
I'm not cut out for this.
Tom put a piece candy into his mouth.
You're not going to find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything's ready.
She is in a bad mood.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Wipe your face clean.
Have you decided yet?
Tom's eavesdropping.
Can anybody hear me?
How're you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to have sex with her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a rough time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a chain.
I'd much rather go by myself.
It was from them.
I want to lie down and rest for a while.
Tom is in the hospital, recovering from a drug overdose.
He cracked the walnut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were going to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom was the one who did this?
She hit me, not him.
I will be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom is here already.
They look busy today.
I'm sure that Tom has never been to Boston.
I think I should check on Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom is a big shot.
When you are meeting a girl, you have to act confident.
Tom, please, this isn't the time or place.
We had her under surveillance.
Tom is untrustworthy.
It irritates Mary when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
It's good training.
This chair is one of a kind.
I should've said no.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my strategy.
I've been living here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my love.
I know you tried your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside cover of his notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should feel bad for them.
I don't compromise.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
It's fun to watch TV.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is really great.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Keep Tom entertained.
They're only words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom swears too much.
Nobody walks in LA.
I'm not a whore.
He hurried in order to get the bus.
It didn't bother me.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree to this plan.
Justice is expressed through actions.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
It was childish of him to behave like that.
I'm walking with her.
That'd be fine.
I apologize for yesterday.
Leave while you can.
Tom felt a tad awkward around Mary.
I don't need those.
Was Tom the one who gave you that?
Automobiles replaced carriages.
They kidnapped me.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea tastes good.
We are on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very hard on himself.
She's a nerd.
The lemonade is cold.
The lamp was swinging back and forth.
Tom looks uncertain.
What more can I ask?
Tom is materialistic.
That would be wrong.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I put up my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Will you wait a moment?
It isn't over yet.
Look at that pole in the square.
Didn't anybody tell you that you didn't have to be here today?
I was really pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Mary he'd never met John.
Did you get all that?
You'd better go help him.
Tell me if you find a boyfriend.
It was remarkable.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can hardly see him.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Don't expect everyone to share that opinion.
I appreciate sweet things and books.
This is much worse.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got stung.
Don't you ever question anything?
I stared at the man.
Keep an eye on Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Contact her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I wish you were with me.
I like to play golf.
Tom became deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'll go to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get any sleep at all?
It's probably still available.
It looks like we're going to have a white Christmas this year.
You met my sister, didn't you?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works indoors.
His concert was great.
There's no answer.
Tom told me that he wanted me to buy a painting for him.
This is real easy.
Are you going to walk?
You should try it.
You've got enough to worry about.
I don't think Tom is going to be too much help.
Tom looked concerned.
I worry about him.
Tom is extraordinary.
I suspect it was Tom who broke the window.
Tom stepped forward.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is compassionate.
Make it brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've managed.
This is no one's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go get lunch.
It is warmer today than yesterday.
It had to come from somewhere.
The country house was complete, with a swimming pool, a barbecue, a soccer field and a pool table.
Tom says that he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll be seeing you again.
We were so young at that time.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While eating a pizza he was annoying his sister.
We should've quit earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom is courteous.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We are having dinner.
My efforts have been futile thus far.
"Why did you do it?" "Because I can."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heat.
We're all the same.
I wish I were by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not so horrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anybody else.
This was my mistake.
This sounds totally legit.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and reliable, whilst the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give in.
What did you and Tom do yesterday?
I won't cut corners.
She switched off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher's.
We must know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you believe them?
I come from Beijing.
There are only two genders in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what should I tell him?
Where is your child?
Tom is on the bed, talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are full.
Tom was overjoyed.
I am eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're fortunate.
You probably think I'm a creep.
Where did Tom work?
I need help carrying them.
The noise alarmed the whole town.
Whoever loves flowers cannot be a bad person.
This isn't a game.
He pecked her on the lips.
You're being mean.
Did you deliver the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have a small chest.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom is panting.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears flashy clothes.
Tom's feet were bare.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Girls don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem, it is mine.
Before going to bed, I took three pills to stop a cold.
Tom might be wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom was behaving like a spoiled brat.
It's a pity you destroyed everything.
We should ask him.
I'll give them back.
What did you need to see me about?
I think I've figured out what time we need to leave.
They're very well.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions. Second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who could blame him?
The audience seems to feel bored.
I raise cattle.
She borrowed the ruler.
We'll be seeing you.
I had to get something.
I believed them.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There's a war going on.
Was Tom in on it?
The thief disguised himself as a policeman.
We'll let Tom try.
That's the logical thing to do.
I'm going to go wash my hands.
Choose one.
Tom is angry and afraid.
You're evil and disgusting.
I wish I could've helped you more.
Tom is now out of sight.
I think we're done.
Tom said he saw Mary sitting in the park by herself.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
The facade of the building was completely renovated. I didn't recognize it when I drove by.
Can this be all there is?
We'll do this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This needs to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Ask him to join us.
It's not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They have her sedated.
This is irrelevant.
I'll be back in a little bit.
She seemed surprised by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting divorced.
She is having dinner.
My jar is leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom is quite a poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the cables snapped.
The geyser sends up a column of hot water every two hours.
Obey your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I have no home to return to.
I'm here by choice.
It's for your protection.
I've always had help.
They don't want it.
Tom is taking charge.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's reassuring.
He's very shy. He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are those?
It may be dangerous.
I must talk with you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you contact him?
Tom said that if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to old people.
Rare gems include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz and ruby.
Go and find them.
Before doing so, you must ask your mother for permission.
I'm going to take Tom's place.
What brings you to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
Stop shooing the chickens.
It was a wonderful day.
I got him to take my picture.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them.
I ate a hasty lunch.
Tom remembered all kinds of things which no one else could remember.
It's easy to tell them apart.
I'll go look for her.
Of all the languages I've studied, French was the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I counted up to 200.
Get a load of this.
Should I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Keep away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you get the loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
The project isn't going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea concretely.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed at Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework to do.
He breathed deeply.
That's disgusting.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman gets shy easily.
Can you get there by car?
I think perhaps I can help her.
I'll do what I please.
Tom has lots of time.
I'll be OK.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a beautiful bracelet.
Go and see if Tom is in his office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom screamed at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a large amount of money from her.
Can you help me figure it out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her one wish was to return and see her only daughter one last time.
She's the woman I desire.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'll go find another one.
I'm starved.
I bought myself a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders spin webs.
You sure do talk a lot.
We may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what others say.
He's head over heels in love.
Don't buy me anything.

I'm being serious.

Call the number I gave you.
I'll check in with you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I got something for him.
I would've said no.

This is only a simulation.
Glad to see you, Tom.
I felt kind of sorry for her.
He is generous to excess.
Tom slept outside.
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get your butt over here!
You could've said no.

What will happen will happen.
I heard that story.

I feel cold.
He walked ahead of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?

Turn off the light.
Do you want to come over?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't going to work.
He soon walked away.
The children were so excited after the party that they couldn't sleep.

Tom went away angry.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should know a lot about oils and lubricants for engines.

I'm claustrophobic.
Tom never told me he didn't know how to swim.
Tom quickly disappeared in the crowd.
For the record, I'm not at all interested.
No, I'm still a bachelor.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
It's not surprising.
That was surprising.
That matter is the same one that we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a fatal sexually transmitted disease.
It doesn't surprise me.
He turned the corner.
She ratted me out.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
Somebody will see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I was so wrong about her.
It's almost finished.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?

I'll remember that.
What time does class begin?
Can you wiggle your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour until the event.
You were incredible.
I won't quit until we find out who's responsible.
The alarm started ringing.
The bird picked up the twig with its beak and flew to its nest.

It's already open.
It is dependent on you if we will buy it or not.

Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom is quite good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is awfully calm.
I'll ask Tom to make some time for you tomorrow morning.
What in the world did you buy?

It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a simple question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was concerned.
My conscience bothers me.
How did you know Tom would lie to me?
Every nation has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are such amazing creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I have the time to do it.
Tom got drunk on tequila.
My grandmother is hard of hearing. In other words she is slightly deaf.
We've humiliated Tom.
Stop playing around.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
How do you get on with your parents?
Tom wants something to do.
You should've asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
You have my respect.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
These benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You've got to work together.
Show me your hand.
Those are hounds.
You ought to get into the habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Let's get out of here now.
Tom picked up the broken glass.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
He's the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go get changed.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where did you buy that? I want one too.
Tom is an excellent physician.
Tom is very unhappy.
How did you get these?
What more will I get?
People are trying to eat around here.
I need you more than you can possibly realize.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a watch.
Tom must've been the one who added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to keep it a secret.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to get your car running.
Did you hear it too?
What did they find?
He lied to my face.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to wash up.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom had done that.
If I ignore it, it will go away.
We'll just be in Tom's way.
Maybe I should give her a hand.
Don't touch the exhibits.
I may be able to find her.
I learned it by heart.
I don't have anything to give you.
They found a secluded beach where they spent the day.
Nothing was changed.
Everyone was alert.
He's somewhat hard of hearing, so please speak louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is walking south.
Love is like oxygen.
It concerns you.
That's a very dry explanation.
A walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them at a place they choose.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I resent his rude attitude.
I've asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There is no response from him.
We are all eager to see the movie.
It's quite simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom had his T-shirt on backwards.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, OK?
The dinner was so good!
Get control of yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, division is not.
I'm teasing.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
Oil is running short.
I think Tom won't go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Have you seen today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks between three and six coffees a day.
Tom burped loudly.
It was worse.
Tom started to snore.
I'm going to ask you to stay around for a while.
We keep two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Tom may be dead before morning.
We don't have a dog.
Make haste, and you will be in time.
Tom was astonished.
This can is empty.
There are some grapes in the refrigerator.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend you'd never heard of Tom?
Tom relaxed his grip.
Einstein regarded himself a philosopher.
The steam has fogged my glasses.
It can't be!
I didn't mean that.
Tom wasn't with me.
I know it for a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the red flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it was going to be hard to do.
I think I found one.
You'll give it a shot, won't you?
Tom went without food for a whole week.
I don't really understand you.
Although I am a pious man, I am not the less a man.
Tom excused himself for being late.
Are there any problems I should know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
Many people hunt.
He deserves the prize.
Could I talk to you?
Where are we headed?
Tom does basically the same thing as Mary does.
We need to check something out.
Tom's eyes opened.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good point.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
That was Tom on the phone.
How's your chest?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who spoke?
Tom started to say something, but Mary shushed him.
We met in an inn.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing for me to drink.
I've been all over town looking for Tom.
Turn it on.
The nightlife is better in New York.
Please come on in.
This medicine is to be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom isn't a member.
I guess our job is not to let that happen.
Why is space black?
I felt bad.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said that the house was haunted.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs do not grunt.
Tom became conscious.
Tom made Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at it.
Tom may come today.
Tom cannot distinguish between reality and imagination.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no will power.
Will you lend a hand?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't at home when I dropped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's just get on with it.
Better to die standing than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems to be sad.
I was home all night.
We went out from there at eleven.
You can ask me anything you like.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
How are you related?
You deserve a raise.
You should talk. You only got a 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human as it is from another dimension.
They're bothering me.
How's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've found a cure for that yet.
Every member must attend.
He didn't get her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen!
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is clearly frustrated and desperate.
You must be freezing.
Who would want Tom dead?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You've got to let me get a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Flour is made from wheat.
Don't ever touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary about the matter.
You're fair.
I will go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'm going to eat it.
I guess I'll just go over to Tom's.
Did Tom get any gifts?
You two are very cute together.
You sure are pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's quite possible that I'm mistaken.
What is happiness?
Dan injured Linda's dog.
He dislocated his collarbone while playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know that there was a swimming pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The play is over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is going blind.
Do you really believe that this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was brash.
This isn't an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I just can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom follows a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
She asked if I felt like cooking something.
Pay attention on the road.
We'll stop along the way.
I heard Tom sobbing.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
I thought you said you could play the piano.
It's closing time.
Let me handle him.
The rock rolled down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser's.
Tom must be crazy.
Do it again!
He has a bad heart.
One should not make comments.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom isn't that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is really cute.
You're a real nerd.
Sorry, we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look horrified.
I could make things easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave my house in slippers.
I think Tom is petty.
She had a bad infection and her ovary swelled up.
I don't need any counseling.
This one's no good.
It is out of the question.
Tom made for the exit.
Who'd want to kill me?
His behaviour is sometimes weird.
We were going to hang them.
This is probably not a good time to be doing this.
I'll only be a moment.
I have a list from her.
That was so stupid.
How did it go, Tom?
I have other things I need to be doing.
Believe in justice!
What's Tom saying?
Why shouldn't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from her.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make a blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him immediately.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes gossiping.
I've got lots of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even moving story.
I'll call Tom back.
Every language sees the world in a different way.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom will want to go drinking with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have everything.
How much is one beer?
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you ever find her?
This one was on top of the pile.
I'm finished with it.
We must not give up.
We were under attack.
He is an atheist.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we had that argument.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you had found someone else.
I don't know if I should stay or run.
Don't you think it is rather warm for December?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm wet.
Are you falling for him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
That island is American territory.
Just put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I've baked a cake for her.
Tom never told me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people can fit in this room?
I'd already thought of that.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You sprained your ankle.
Are you still here?
You're predictable.
I was a bit shocked.
