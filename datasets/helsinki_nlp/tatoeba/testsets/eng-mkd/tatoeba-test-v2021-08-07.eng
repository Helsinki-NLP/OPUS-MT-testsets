I received this fax from her.
I recognize that guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I resent his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I rinsed one.
Iron is harder than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'll get it.
I said it might rain.
I said open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw a UFO.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him just now.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw it over there.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
I saw nothing at all.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Is eating potatoes fattening?
I see no conspiracy there.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you are awake.
I sent Tom to Boston in my place.
I set out early so as to catch the first train.
Is everybody busy?
Is everybody happy?
Is everybody having a great time?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should certainly buy you a drink.
I should feel bad for them.
I should get her home.
I should get packed.
I should go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have believed her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's house.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should've asked her first.
I should've asked them first.
I should've asked you first.
I should've been more polite.
I should've checked.
I should've done that yesterday.
I should've known you'd be here.
I should've said no.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is it just me, or is Tatoeba extremely slow today?
Is it the last lesson?
Is it time to leave?
Is it true?
I slapped him.
I sleep standing up.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a log.
I slept on the boat.
I slept on the bus.
I sliced the sandwich diagonally.
Is Mike off the bottle?
I smiled to myself.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom was the one who did this?
Isn't that curious?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the same guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this amazing?
I sort of like him.
I spent all day shoveling snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is she your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started dating him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Is that a yes or no?
Is that even a word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
Is that where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you won't help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is there a delivery charge?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there something in particular that you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this appropriate?
Is this diamond real?
Is this ethical?
Is this good English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this radio yours?
Is this seat taken?
Is this seat vacant?
Is this what all the hype was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your sack or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom has gone.
I still can't really believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Is Tom able to swim?
Is Tom back?

Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom pestering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Is Tom talking to you yet?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I struck a match in the darkness.
I study art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest that you study harder.
I suggest we concentrate on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I suggest you duck.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I suppose I should go talk to Tom.
I suppose that's OK.
I suspected as much.
I suspect it was Tom who broke the window.
I swam in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't date you if I was on fire and you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Italian politicians make me mad.
I talked to my advisors about which classes to take.
It all makes sense.
It all seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
It can't be!
It can't be!
It concerns you.
It cost a lot more than I thought it would.
It could never, ever happen here.
It could've been Tom.
It'd be a disaster.
It'd be good.
It didn't bother me.
It didn't come up.
It didn't get that bad.
It disappointed him.
It'd look good.
It doesn't bother me.
It doesn't get better.
It doesn't look all that different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; the fact is that you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
It doesn't sound like much.
It doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
It fits perfectly.
It gave me an idea.
It gives me something to do.
It had to be done.
It had to come from somewhere.
It hangs on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It happens.
It happens.
It has cooled off.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It hasn't been easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I think about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he is right.
I think he's correct.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can do it.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.

I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I may sneeze.
I think I’m going to be okay.
I think I should check on Tom.
I think I should've asked for help.
I think I speak French fairly well.
I think it's a little risky to do that without some help.
I think it's best if I stay here for a while.
I think it's time for us to start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom any money.
I think I've figured out what time we need to leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think perhaps I can help her.
I think she is good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel is going to be a little pricey for you.

I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.

I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you need to call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're overstating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.

I think you've been here before.
I think you've been in the jungle too long.
I think you've been lied to.
I think you've been spending too much time with Tom.
I think you've got to work this out on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I thought about you.
I thought her boobs were bigger.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but apparently I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was hallucinating.

I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts tremendously here.
It irritates Mary when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
It is a multi-stage process.
It is dependent on you if we will buy it or not.
It is his first day of school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
It is just out of the question for me to finish the work in a day.
It is less humid today than it was yesterday.
It isn't a bit cold.
It isn't expensive.
It isn't over yet.
It isn't that bad.
It isn't wrong.
It is OK for me to use that?
It is on me.
It is out of the question.
It is said that the old chapel is haunted.
It is starting to sink in that we can't ignore nature.
It is warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting one famous section of his essay.
It is written in his face.
It is written in his face.
It just doesn't feel right.
It just doesn't feel safe.
It just sounds boring.
It keeps happening.
It'll be all right.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It'll be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked awful.

It looks as if you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.

It looks like an egg.
It looks like I drank too much yesterday. My head is pounding. I'm completely hungover.
It looks like those two have gotten back together.
It looks like those two have made up.
It looks like we're going to have a white Christmas this year.

It made me feel close to Tom.
It made me strong.
It makes me nervous.
It may be dangerous.
It may be hard.
It may be too late already.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
It may rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
It might be him.
It might be risky.
It might not just be a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must've been her.
It must've slipped my mind.
It needs to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them. I also told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't do it.
I told you it was going to be hard to do.
I told you that my dad died when I was thirteen.
I told you that this would become tiresome.
I told you the truth.
I, too, am a teacher.
I took a trip to Boston.
I took care of that.
I took my shoes off.
I took the bus back.
I took Tom to lunch.
I tore my pants.
I tossed and turned all night.
I totally understand.
It probably won't be worth the wait.
It rained two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but he doesn't understand.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I truly regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I try not to worry about you.
I try not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It's a complete disaster!
It's advisable to check whether there'll be any adverse affects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you've been prescribed.
It's a game for children.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over for us.
It's all over now.
It's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost finished.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
It's almost time for her to go.
It's a lot of fun.
It's already 7:00.
It's already eleven.
It's already open.
It's a minor glitch.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
It's a no-brainer.
It's a pity you destroyed everything.
It's a question of integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a red herring.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame that concrete doesn't burn.
It's a short walk.
It's a simple job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid policy.
It's a wonderful idea, but it'll take a lot work.
It's been dismantled.
It's been nothing but trouble.
It's been raining for around a week.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's been unusually warm this week.
It's best not to talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than to be a pessimist and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's blank.
It's boiling in here.
It's brand new.
It scared me.
It's clear.
It's closing time.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's difficult to evaluate his ability.
It's difficult to explain.
It's disconcerting.
It's easier this way.
It's easier to stay out of jail than to get out of jail.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
It's easy to tell them apart.
It seems I was wrong about him.
It seems like her style.
It seems like the only possible conclusion.
It seems well written.
It's empty.
It serves you right.
It's evil to curse.
It's exactly 10:00.
It's exactly what happened before.
It's extremely rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's for your protection.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
It's fun to watch TV.
It's getting cloudy.
It's getting darker.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be brutal.
It's going to get even colder.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
It's good training.
It's good.
It's gotten better.
It's great fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot down here.
It should be possible to do that.
It shouldn't take us long to finish this.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's in a safe place.
It's in peak condition.
It's in the basement.
It's just a guess.
It's just a simple question.
It's just imaginary.
It's just sitting there.
It's just up ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and cool.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel needed.
It's no big deal.
It's no big thing.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
It's not a high priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not backwards.
It's not exactly how it happened.
It's not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
It's nothing serious.
It's not just a guess.
It's not just a pen.
It's not light enough in here to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not ridiculous.
It's not so little.
It's not spring yet.
It's not surprising.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not very often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It snowed last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It's obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's only a temporary solution.
It sounds like Tom.
It sounds really cool.
It sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's perfectly white.
It's poison.
Its presence is important for me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably right.
It's probably still available.
It's probably still available.
It's punctured.
It's quite common actually.
It's quite delicious.
It's quite possible that I'm mistaken.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's quite simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really gross.
It's really unfortunate.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
It's so cool!
It's so cool!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still for sale.
It's still functioning.
It's still not right.
It's still rising.
It's still there.
It's strange that people in hot climate zones eat spicy things like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's that time again.
It's the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's the bite of a spider.
It's thundering outside. I'm really scared!
It's time for you to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too conspicuous.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them at a place they choose.
It's totally cool.
It's totally lame.
It's totally wrong.
It's unbearably hot.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It sure is hot.
It's urgent that I see Tom.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
It's wild guess.
It's windy.
It's work.
It's your loss.
It's yours for the asking, Tom.
It's yours.
It takes only three minutes for the water to boil.
It took all evening.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to rid myself of all those ants.
It turns out that you are unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned the TV off.
I turned Tom down.
It was a big honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was absolutely amazing.
It was a disgrace.
It was after midnight.
It was a good day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
It was all so easy.
It was an amazing evening.

It was a remarkable experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a terrific experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
It was childish of him to behave like that.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was fairly funny.
It was far too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
It was fun yesterday.
It was getting dark.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my mistake.
It was my suitcase.
It was nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as difficult to do as I thought it was going to be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It wasn't important.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It was proven that fleas living on dogs jump higher than fleas living on cats.
It was quite spectacular.
It was rather funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really sweet.
It was really touching.

It was so nice a day that we went for a hike in the mountains.
It was so obvious.
It was spooky.
It was still there.
It was Tom who gave me the painting hung on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was tragic.
It was two months ago that I arrived in Tokyo.
It was unthinkable.
It was very generous of you to buy all these things for us.
It was very stuffy in that room with all the windows closed.
It was worse.
It was worth a try.
It was your mistake.
It will not be fine.
It won't be enough.
It won't be lonely here.
It won't cost anything to repair it.
It won't do any good to lie about it.
It won't help you.
It works fine.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
It would take forever for me to explain everything.
I urgently need you.
I used to babysit you.
I used to dream about being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I use this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful to not say too much.
I've always had help.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've asked everybody.
I've asked Tom to help you.
I've baked a cake for her.
I've baked a cake for them.
I've been after them for a long time.
I've been a little distracted.
I've been all over town looking for Tom.
I've been a lot worse.
I've been betrayed.
I've been briefed.
I've been burgled three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.
I've been careless.
I've been careless.
I've been dying to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I've been happy here.
