Would you call me for your wedding party?
I want you to wash my car.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
I think that Tom needs glasses.
Tom kept staring.
His sister and her husband live in Canada.
Unwittingly, he told her exactly what she wanted to know.
The water pipe burst.
We strolled through the park.
At first I felt a bit too shy to speak to her.
When did she send you her pictures?
I plan to go to France next year.

Why does he bother?
Whose idea was it?
Why doesn't he tell the truth?
Have you finished all your Christmas shopping?
I like your room.
I am not your friend.
Nobody heard Tom's screams.
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
If you had taken my advice, you wouldn't be in such trouble.
You'll get these, won't you?
What's the point of showing up on time if everyone else shows up late?
I want to do that, but I don't have enough time.
We don't have any other options.

The best thing you can have is good friends.

These shoes are expensive, and what is more, they are too small.
If you return to your country of birth, you will be free and will become happy.
All of us can speak French.
Skura and Nuja were wrong about that.
He returned to Algiers.
They have diplomatic ties with Algeria.
Some people have very fast serves.
French is difficult, isn't it?
Why don't you get a little sleep?
What else would you like to know?

Normally, the doctor doesn't do this.

I must know where these quotations originate.
Strive to be happy.
This book is to me what the Bible is to you.
Let's try and stay focused.

They kept Skura waiting.
It doesn't look like you're tired.
Tom wants to get married.
Sami was glad to see Layla happy again.
Why don't you make up your mind?
I cannot brake! The brakes are broken!
If you will lend me the money, I shall be much obliged to you.
You will hide it, won't you?
There has been a case of death in her family.
Few people know about the plan.
He asked me to throw the ball back.
Tom told me he'd try doing that.
I know you don't like me.
You built it, didn't you?
The United States has diplomatic ties with more than 100 countries.
You can relax now.
Skura was punished for lying.
Are they speaking French?
Shit, where the fuck did I put my home keys?
Which side are you on?
Is it true that special forces soldiers are trained to torture?
What does it concern you?
How do you prefer to cook trout?
The fire was extinguished at once.
I translate into Esperanto for free.
The city is fifty miles above London.
Can you mail these letters for me?
Looks like it’s your lucky day.
Where did you drown them?

I forgot to turn off the light.
We live near the dike.
Don't play. Work!

Passports, please.
It'd be great if you could pick up some bread before you come home.

You like seafood, don't you?
You have half an hour to get the cameras ready.
Tom is looking for his glasses.
You can't help me.
Skura and Nuja gave up running for class president.
What did you get hit with?
Her face was white.
You must come in.
They fell.
Please find me my overcoat.
I seldom eat meat.
Tom doesn't seem to have a lot of friends.
We may be late for school.
It goes without saying that money cannot buy happiness.
May I speak to you a minute?
Nuja missed Skura.
Skura came in.
Drink your milk!
They look healthy.
That's all they have.
Mary and I have been acquainted with each other for many years.
I love trips.
Can I walk down here?
He cried a lot.
I'm going to hang out with him.
You'll go to school tomorrow.
They ran past Skura.
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
Tom resigned today.
Let the dog go.
You helped me.
He saw a mouse.
Where did you deafen them?
If I were rich, I'd give you money.
Ask her if she'll sew up the hole in your jeans.
She is a very good teacher.

Send me there.
You brought yours, didn't you?
Sami killed and ate his wife.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
Tom got on his bicycle.
I still don't speak French very well.
Where would you like to go first?
Let's go back to our places.
I will explain it for you.
Will it snow tonight?
I fooled you, didn't I?
Do you think she still thinks about me?
Tom wanted to surprise you.
Breaking Bad is my favorite series.
You'll lose time.
It's new.
Do you think the situation will improve?
We all hate her.
Please bring the master key.
Try to keep in touch with me, just in case.
We closed the store.
Get back, get back!
Do you like science-fiction movies?
My parents left the church.
Two glasses of orange juice, please.
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
Why do you hang out with guys like Tom?
Tom betrayed you.
When was the last time you parked your car here?
You drink milk, don't you?
Tom has a cousin who is a doctor.
You like baseball?
Don't let him open the door.
Sami went in the house.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
Leave it closed.
You're killing me.
Plum blossoms come out in March.
Today both of you are staying home.
You left the building at about 6 p.m., didn't you?
She drinks beer.
That house belongs to us.
She's not as shy as she used to be.
You should've seen the movie.
His legs were trembling from fear.

Don't delay today's work until tomorrow.
Step forward.
Sami was a crooked cop.

Why don't you go back to the hospital and see how Tom is doing?
She was pleased.
You have broad shoulders.
His face turned pale.
Where is the ice cream man?

You know it, don't you?
It's a very strange case.
Our visitors are sitting in the living room.

You scared us.
My computer doesn't boot up anymore.
Why can't Tom do that, too?
