What are we looking for?
What did you say? I can't hear you.
What did you say?
What did you say yesterday?
What does it say?
What do you do here?
What do you think Tom will do?
What's going to happen today?
What's this dog's name?
What's your wife's job?

You are taller than I.
You can go to sleep now.
You can sit here.
You can't stop them.
You don't remember?
You had a cat.
You'll die out there.
You look tired.
You look tired. You must have been working too hard.
You missed me, didn't you?
You or I?
You're a beauty.
You're in the right place.
You're not my father.
Your father is tall.
You saw a mouse, didn't you?
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
You tricked me.
