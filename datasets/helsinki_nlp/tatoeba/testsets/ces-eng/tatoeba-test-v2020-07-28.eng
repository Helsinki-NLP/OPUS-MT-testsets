Mary used to dream about getting married.
To each his own.
When Tom returned home in the evening, he found out that there was no supper left for him.
She knows them.
They must be very proud of their daughter.
Tom turned right and Mary headed the other way.
There's one left.
He started to explain what happened.
Tom has a cast iron stomach. He can eat just about anything.
The mother didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows wines.
Tom felt someone tap him on the shoulder.
Do you know whose parents they are?
No words can express how amazing you are.
I would like fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The cuneiform alphabet invented by the Sumerians was used by many languages in the ancient Near East.
I like summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course yes!
Mary likes you.
What will you be having?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where've you been all afternoon?
You got yourself a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before the meal.
I haven’t talked about this to anyone.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking I'll take a few days off.
Tom never speaks French with me.
Tom left a large tip on the table.
There is nothing like a glass of beer after a whole day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I have been satisfied with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here I have the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I had been invited.
Hello? Are you still here?
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
What a nice car you have! You must have paid a lot for it.
Tom is obviously lying.
So, straight, then to the right, and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why is there no food in my refrigerator?
It was nothing more than an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom turns thirteen the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't see her ruin her whole life.
Do everything with deliberation.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
My wife and I both want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
This belt is too tight on me.
Playing the bassoon isn't easy.
She took the job only to gratify her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you like.
Tom hesitated to bring up the subject.
At my place, we drink a lot of beer.
Would you have Tom come to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You ought not to act selfishly.
Ancient customs are dying out quickly today.
Tom's always busy.
You'd better set off at once.
Tom doesn't have children.
I like reading.
We cut the rope.
Sorry to bother you. I have just come to apologize.
Tom won't be helping us tomorrow.
Tom has stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a tree lying across the railway line.
What did Tom shout at crowd?
He is an ideal husband for me.
She is not as beautiful as her older sister.
I've brought you lunch today.
We're going to the party in eighteenth century costumes.
Are you happy with your body?
Could I speak to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort he climbed up the tree.
To translate a Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood, too.
We know all this already, Tom.
I am glad that you brought it to my attention.
I skipped breakfast.
You lied to me.
It is a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise next door.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
It's hailing.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen on you?
They don't help.
I like that tie.
We didn't do as well as we would've liked.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joan have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You freaked me out.
The girls whom I met today were students.
The sky is full of dark clouds.
I need this more than you.
He bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck in this place forever.
Tom gave himself an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Do you go to school by train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm angry at Tom.
Who is Tom visiting?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
How about you buy me a drink?
Why won't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wondered where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
Here's another question.
I won't be surprised if that happens.
He is unmarried.
That isn't what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom thoroughly washed his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jane was on top of the world when she got a record contract.
I wish you had come with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you had helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He will visit his uncle.
Everyone's out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anybody live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days now.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom never got better.
I told Tom that he was a fair-weather friend and he took offence.

This bridge used to be a toll bridge.
He waved at her.
I was late for school this morning.
I participated in the search.
Sam went directly to bed.
We spread out the tablecloth on the grass by the river.

My heart is French, but my ass is international!
If you've got a problem, I'd like to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hands.
I'm perfectly happy being alone.
You've done what you needed to do.
We need to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your father's name?
Half-destroyed walls used to stand there.
I spoke to him in English and found I could make myself understood.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Have any of you ever talked to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You've gotten fat.
We ought to win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I am considering divorcing her.
I purchased one bag.
Do you know where your father went?
Who on earth are you?
Did you do that purposely?
There was absolutely no doubt.

As far as I know, he is not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll be able to see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we all burst out laughing.
Tom is wrong, isn't he?
Better dead than red.
They agreed to postponing the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be wonderful if you did that for me.

I am still eating.
The horse neighs.
I borrowed Tom's hairbrush.
I am boring.
I'm writing my will.

I know that she is cute.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
He has a house of his own.
I don't usually do that in the evening.

Just sweep it under the rug.
I'm so happy you're here.
She's petite.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.

Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to produce sentences that sound strange. Please make sure you only translate the sentence if you are sure you know what it means.
