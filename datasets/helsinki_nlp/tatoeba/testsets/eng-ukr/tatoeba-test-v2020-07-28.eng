They're sympathetic.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did that?
It's never too late.
Let me be. I'm sleeping.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for work.
Dad will return in a few days.
Is it true that Midori plays the violin very well?
Well, that explains it.
You're pretty optimistic, aren't you?

Give me the bill, please.
I'm seeing my uncle tomorrow.
You're the most important person in my life.
I hope Tom changes his mind.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
Zucchinis are green.
I will finish my homework by nine.
Where were you born?
Did you say you had a fight with Tom?
Your shoes are untied.
This book sold well in Japan.
I like to dance.
The facts became known to everyone.
Tom is angry with you, isn't he?
I would like to become a famous soccer player.
Was I snoring?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing that.
Since I didn't receive a reply, I wrote to her again.
What would you like to say about this?
Do you think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
I borrowed Tom's car.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.
There is almost no furniture.
I'm ready to go, but Tom isn't.
I feel like another person.
No matter what happens, I'll stay with you.
Every day they killed a llama to make the Sun God happy.
He's a lush.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

Write to Tom.
Tom warned me of the danger.
Alice is a member of The Satanic Temple.
When was the last time you bought shoes?
You're surrounded.
What do you and Tom want to do?
Tom didn't poison Mary.
She cried reading the letter.
You should tell the truth.
You could be right.
This one is prettier.
Now he is eating dinner.
You gave me your word.
I want Tom to wait.
We have arrived!
Are you annoyed by that?
What is in the box?
Be careful. It's still warm.
Tom treated Mary like a child.
Why are you so gloomy?
I did that just for fun.
Tom refused to say anything.
Mother has sent you some cakes and milk.
I met someone the other day that I think I could fall in love with.
Are you saying you don't want to help us paint the ceiling?
Your secret will be safe with me.
Take a look at that.
I have never gone to Florida.
You're too skinny.
We talked for hours.
I'm smashed.
Tom told me he thought that Mary was reliable.
Do you agree with their decision?
Put that on my bill.
The hen has been brooding its eggs for a week.
You look nice with your hair short.
Tom is already in Boston.
I went to a concert with Tom.
Tom had a stroke.
Why did you ask Tom to do that when you knew he couldn't do it?
Did you see him go out?
May I talk to Ms. Brown?
He lived in central London.
What was inside?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
Which do you like better, summer or winter?
Aren't you planning to do that?
Luckily nobody got wet.
Nobody knows who killed Tom.
It's not as difficult as you think.
Why are you angry at me?
Let's go get drunk.
You've got to wait.
Tom has a lot of friends.
What were you doing today?
I don't know what he knows.
Hello all!
Is it OK if I open a can?
I'm trying to get some rest.

She is five years old.
Let's hope so.
Tom is coming next week.
You need to stop doing that right now.
My grandfather speaks very slowly.
Did you win?
She can speak English pretty well.
I need to go.
Tom didn't seem overly concerned.
Tom says he plans to do that.
What he did wasn't wrong.
Can you give me a minute?
Is there something cold to drink?
I have to speak with them.
They are too big.
We'll give you one more chance.
I could do it.
Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He is a medical student.
That is not necessarily so.
I know Tom.
Tom isn't a very good teacher.

He talked about himself.
Let's put up the tent while it is still light.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary's car.
We'll get another chance.
Tom's car has been repossessed.

There is one problem.
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Why did you come back here?
The room is warming up.
Tom can play the guitar, I think.
We've seen it.
Tom never breaks a promise.
The chicken is undercooked.
I think that I'll play tennis with Tom.

Tom was actually early.
I want to drink a cup of tea.
What's your father do?
I'm a loser.
Do you know my wife?

You're not upset, are you?
We have half a dozen eggs.
Tom refused to leave.
She drank coffee.
Tom reiterated what Mary said.
Tom was thirteen when he died.
I wish you good luck.
He used to read a lot.
What do you think really happened?
Mom spread the table.
Please bring me a clean knife.
Mary is tolerant, isn't she?
Do you think Tom might be part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go for a walk.
Tom is waiting for me at the station.
I put cream in my coffee.
I can't put up with this noise anymore.
Please don't leave yet.
I was surprised by Tom's candor.
I was rereading the letters you sent to me.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
I understand, you were joking.
Do you want to learn to play guitar?
I didn't want to dance.
Wait. I will pay for this.
We are sure of his success.
The gods punish sinners.
Have you ever visited the Statue of Liberty?
I've got an idea.
I just bought some cardboard.
I'm too old for Tom.
This party is boring.
Why did you return home today?

Don't you want me to do anything?
Tom can't change that.
Would you like Tom to do that with you?
Did you know Tom was lonely?
Mary is my older sister.
He finally succeeded.

Your room's ready.
I want it now.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
I don't like lending money to anybody.
We're teachers.
We are in the evacuation zone.

This bus is going to Minsk.
I need to find them now.
My mother loves to eat cottage cheese.
Been there, done that.
I love her.
Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?
I completely agree.
Is that what you wanted to say?
Would you like a banana?
We have to be at work by nine.
We were all asleep.
I haven't washed my hands yet.
Which one?
Tom went to see Mary.
I've got money.
I thought Tom understood.
Do you have a large family?
I am a taxpayer.
Tom is holding a pen in his right hand.
There are many kinds of coffee.
I'm glad you're all right.
Tom recognized me.
You're lying.
Tom followed Mary out.
Tom was the one who kissed Mary, not John.
I have other plans for you.
Can you see Tom?
I like riding my bike.
The bullet found its mark.
Tom ran to catch up to Mary.
How can I help you?
Tom was convicted and sentenced to death.
It'll be our secret.
What time did you go to sleep yesterday?
I'm not marrying you.
Doing that is too risky.

She is your queen.
I asked Tom what I should do.
I don't think Tom knows how to ride a unicycle.
I am too short.

I doubt that Tom would ever consider going to Australia.
It depends on the context.
This dog is mine.
Tom has been working all day.
Does it matter?
Tom's eyes weren't yet accustomed to the dark, so he couldn't see a thing.

I'm praying.
Nail polish remover stinks a lot.
Russian is considered to be a difficult language.
Thanks for telling me the truth.
He sprained his ankle.
Tom talked me into it.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
Having finished her work, she went home.
Who wants to come with me?
Tom said it wouldn't be hard to do that.
Seems like there are too many Turkish trolls on Tatoeba.
Why are you cursing?
Is that just a coincidence?
Tom may not know where Mary is.
Nothing's working.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
How could you let them do this to you?
What did you tell Tom?
She lives quite close by.
Don't drink too much java.
Can you answer?
What happened on October 20?
I suspect that Tom had nothing to do with that.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Let me deal with Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He was very busy all day.
Tom will come back. I'm sure he will.
He managed to escape.
I wonder what Tom is thinking about.
Tom will bring Mary.
None of us speak French.
She saw him saw the branch.
You ought to let Tom know that you can't do that.
Tom was pretty late.
Tom is good at speaking French.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
It is a pleasant day today.
Fashions change quickly.
I'm totally confused.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
Last year, there was a bad harvest.
Tom has betrayed you.
I was stoned.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
Tom is a friendly guy.
He's eating lunch now.
Eukaryotic cells have nuclei.
It's starting now.
I still have the key to Tom's house.
She talked long of her experiences abroad.
They're all hungry.
Don't be that worried.
Jesus bores me.
Be sensible.
That scares me.
You really should be helping Tom do that.
Mary says she won't do that.
We're going to vote today.

Abraham Lincoln is a famous person.
Tom doesn't have any enemies.
She's afraid of going abroad.
I was born like this.
Please correct it.
Why are you speaking French to Tom?
I finished the work.
I wasn't allowed to see her.
Did Tom sleep well?
Tom and Mary told John.
The lift was not working.
You're beautiful.
There's no one but me here.
Tom didn't want to do that with you.
I've seen you on TV.
Fadil's mother remarried.
He has ten cows.
I like English.
You're cruel.
It looks as if autumn is really here.
I saw a man enter the room.
He is anything but a fool.
I was afraid this might happen.
Who else was at the meeting?
He speaks too fast.
Tom offered Mary a pretty good job.
Is Tom going to help you?
She has a pretty face.
Tom didn't want it.
That fellow can't tell right from wrong.
You are a panda.
I'm not sure where my hotel is.
What kind of candy do you like?
I almost forgot that it was his birthday.
What keeps you up so late?
Layla accused Fadil of seeing other women.
Go with Tom.
I thought he would come alone.

I'm not your slave!
Put away your things.
Am I correct?
I don't go to church anymore.
My name's Henry.
Tom knows he has to keep working.
Tom won't drive to Boston.
I'm still afraid to do that.
I don't want to do that by myself.
Tom didn't know that he had a secret admirer.
Tom is following Mary.
I still don't like Tom very much.
So we'd better stay home.
Tom seems to be getting fatter.
Did you know Tom?
Tom said he had plenty of friends in Boston.
The food is getting cold.

Tom wasn't expecting anybody.
I have to hurry to the station to take the last train.
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
I've been listening to jazz all morning.
Tom used to hang out with Mary and John.
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée.
Tom left that.
Doors open at 2:30 p.m.
I want you to talk to Tom about his behavior.
I'm not in love with Layla.
He was only fourteen years old.
I will teach you to play chess.
The moon is already out.
Somehow I just can't accept that.
Did you find any problems?
Who's going?
It is a holiday tomorrow.
Tom is rather shy, isn't he?
We learned that Tom had an accident.
I hope that you'll come back.
Is there something you want to buy?
You told me to do that.
Tom and Mary are rivals.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Try to keep from crying.
You have very acute hearing.
Can I do it again?
Are your kids still in bed?
You have to try again.
Is Tom a Christian?
I want to see what's going to happen.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you.
Tom lives in Boston, doesn't he?
He is an office worker.
You think that Tom will win, don't you?
Would you stop, please?
They followed you.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Tom had no socks on.
Tom's room is locked.
Sure, gladly.

Could you show me the way to the port?
What did you do last night?
Tom is a good doctor.
Don't you want this job?
Tom said he needed to buy something to eat.

Do you use current technology?
You're overworked.
Tom is in his room.
Did you see anyone else other than Tom last night?
Is this list reliable?
Don't lean against the wall.
Is it still going to rain today?
I don't know what Tom promised.
Are you ready to go?
Please take off your shoes.
We need some money.
I knew all about it.
Do I need to do that now?

What is the delay?
It was easy to answer.
Thank you for the information.
I have a right to know the truth.
I can't confirm that.
Where can I pick up my baggage?
Tom said that he hopes Mary can win.
Wake the kids.
We drank a lot.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is this your beer?
Safety is not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom will dance.
Give me your wallet.
You have nothing.
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
We were disappointed in him.
Tom may already be dead.
I'm gay.
Why am I so tired?
Wait till I finish exams.
How many kids do you have?
I'm not done with Tom yet.
There are thousands of Pastafarians in Ukraine.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I didn't testify.
We have to act quickly.

That's the news.
Have you read that book?

Your prophecy has come true.
jEdit macros are written in BeanShell.
Do you want to go to the concert with us?
Is that a fire truck?
All kinds of food and drink are delicious and good for you, but you have to know when, where, and in what quantity.
I feel this is a good point.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after all these years.
I'm sometimes very careless.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You were eating.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
I'm afraid that I won't finish the report on time.
I'm not likely to be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She is traveling around the world.
The boys are fine.
I wonder whether Tom has told Mary she has to do that or not.
Did Tom say what he needed the money for?
You're kind.

This only happened once.

I want to learn Hebrew.
There's an orange on the table.
Don't ever leave me alone with Tom.
Mary does everything Tom tells her to do.
It really is a good movie.
Why does nobody answer?
Tom told me he thought he had the flu.
My blood boiled.
You've given me good advice.
This bicycle isn't Tom's.
I thought that you had lost your watch.
I don't remember you at all.
Those houses are my uncle's.
I just did my job.
Nobody called Tom.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thanks for your attention.
I didn't apologize.
A lot of young people went to Hawaii this summer.
Tom is my twin brother.
There are no comments for now.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Don't resist.
You're going to pay for this!
Did you understand me?
Tom cut himself.
Does Tom think Mary can do that?
Is this your hat?
Bear in mind that you are dust.
Would you like me to come with you?
Is it white?
Love me, love my dog.
Do you like coconut water?
Barcelona is in Spain.
He's very soft-hearted.

They found the track of a bear in the snow.
My friends think Pastafarianism is a joke.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Tom always has the cutest profile pictures.
I got in the taxi.
Sports always come naturally to him.
No matter what happens, I won't be surprised.
You will regret this.
Tom got here at about 2:30.
The mother cat protected her kittens.
This is not his handwriting.
You can say whatever you want.
It is enough for one day.
Tom gave Mary his heart.
I don't think Tom will remember me.
He speaks German.
Tom isn't as busy as you are.
Why do you need so many shoes?
You are very brave.
I'm completely naked.
Nobody heard anything about my country.
He became a national hero.
Did Tom say where he did that?
We study Chinese.
How do I get to the other side?
Do we have any choice?
You are welcome.
Let me see it.
Tom was beginning to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They are short of food.
Not here.
None were satisfied.
I do hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to fall asleep.
Tom is always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom has just texted me.
Tom is somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't see that coming.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him his name.
When do you want to go?
There must be a pattern.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the barn?
Have you ever been to Washington, the capital of the United States of America?
Mary kept her balance.
I was just lucky.
They're very judgmental.
That's a typo.
I wonder whether Tom is angry or not.
I have to study for the test.
The plane flew east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's a friend of yours.
In Soviet Russia, television watches the audience!
He called me out.
He invited her to go to the concert.
What does the suspect look like?
No one could've stopped that.
Tom died of hunger.
It's good that you're here.
I let in the cat.
I left your umbrella in the bus.
The stroller is in the baby's room.
Does that animal eat people?
Are you vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you lift me?
I'm not pregnant.
It didn't break.
I have got a question.
As if it weren't enough already!
Tom said that Mary is probably still doing that.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
My boss let me leave early today.
At what time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How cute!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start to sing.
I owe him nothing.
Where is your key?
It's going to be quite cold tonight.
I won't ask Tom for help.
How much were you paid to do that?
You don't have to stay.
We'll meet again someday.
You said you wouldn't do that.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
It's time for me to go.
I was broke.
Tom outsmarted me.
How many people have died?
Did those guys do something to you?
Is Mike a member of the swimming club?

They found nothing.
Don't gloat.
I am Antonio.
This land belongs to the Royal Family.
Are the rumors true?
We do want that, don't we?
At long last he made up his mind to propose to her.
Tom wasn't a bit surprised by how well Mary could speak French.
I know you're here.
It's 2:30 now.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is not much hope.
It's not mine.
What is it that you want, Tom?
We're nearly finished.
Tom needs to be home by 2:30.
Do you go to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girlfriend?
Tom is just wasting time.
A molecule is made up of atoms.
We realize that.
Now is not a very good time.
Will you have time to have lunch with me?
I wish he had attended the meeting.
Where are you living now?
Go easy on Bob. You know, he's been going though a rough period recently.
Tom married the girl next door.
My head hurts.
Say that again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I study English.
Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can!
I hate that!
You're a little too young for me.
Tom is too old for you.
Tom said he hoped that Mary wouldn't do that.
Tom did not look back.
My parents have just arrived at the station.
I waved.
Did you get a Christmas present for Tom this year?
He has something to do with the robbery.
My cat looks sad.
Tom and Mary only eat vegetables that they grow themselves.
Tom showed his driver's license to the policeman.
Show me what you have in your pocket.
She gathered the pieces of the broken dish.
When does it start?
Tom felt fine.
What have you learned today?
I work alone.
Tom's team scored a total of 96 points. 55 points were scored in the first half. How many were scored in the second half?
Your shoes are here. Where are mine?
We're on our way home.
Tom has told Mary not to worry.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You're not aiming high enough.
I would like to order a sandwich.
Tom gave me a present.
Where's Daddy?
Who else helped you?
I'd be happy to help you.
Are you over 18?
The dog is trying to escape.
Tom isn't able to read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea that Mary had a crush on him.
Tom's repulsive.
The pharmacy is on Fresno Street.
Tom is your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I've talked to them.
Has Lucy telephoned yet?
It sounds like Tom.
If you don't want to do that, you don't have to.
I was just about to take a bath.
Enjoy your meal.
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me on her team.
Nobody is listening anymore.
You're courageous.
You must do it for yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit over there.
Put it down.
Tom was the last to arrive.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate by herself.
You will find them, won't you?
I can't stand humidity.
Are you sure Tom will come?
Where did you get this key?
May I help you ma'am?
I don't think I'll be scared.
Tom will go in your place.
Do you think fish can hear?
Tom resigned yesterday.
The woman is reading.
Poor Tom's been trying to get to sleep for three hours now.
Tom moved to Australia.
We need to remember that.
I changed the WiFi password.

Let's stop this fruitless discussion.
Tom peeled the apple.
Tom hasn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Nobody would help me do that.
You're Italian.
What is she like?
A pickpocket pinched Mark's passport.
I think you like him.
The magazine only costs two pounds, including shipping.
I will miss you all.
I sat down on a bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come back tomorrow.
What insects have you eaten?
I saw Tom get hit by a car.
Tom is excused.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do that.
I'm really sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm it.
Mary guarantees it.
I'm on the wrong bus.
I rejected this proposition.
Mary has already done what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
Have you got a table booked?
Where has the money gone?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were correct.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Don't you recognize that man?
How about going on a picnic?
We couldn't buy the concert tickets until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Some other time perhaps.
Tom refused to let Mary in the house.
Tom can't play tennis very well.
I'm Palestinian.
I can't possibly do that alone.
Tom needs you here.
We've run short of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in town don't know the pleasures of country life.
Mary's eyes are pretty.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a coke and some fries.
She stole a camera.
Welcome to your new home.
There is a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Is everything in order?
You might be the only one who can do that.
Who's wrong?
Your singing puts professional singers to shame.
You know Tom is lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Omigod!
Tom is grumpy.
It was big.
Tom knows Mary isn't the one who did that.
Esther is a lesbian Jew.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
Do you want me to ask him?
Tom and I aren't scared of Mary.
Try and swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What do you have in your hand?
We're busy.
Time for dinner.
Tom is unlikely to forget how to do that.
Are you drinking?
Will Tom be doing that with you?
Are you up?
The meeting began at five in the afternoon.
Mary said she liked doing that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I have been to Tokyo only once.
I received my electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be all right.
He cut his finger with the knife.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning on doing that.
Presence of all members is obligatory.
Aren't you uncomfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud.
I was born in May.
I also agree.
I'm in luck.
A small cup of coffee costs €2.
I wonder whether or not I can do that again.
We need to decide today.
Who are you planning to do that with?
We're pleased with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He stood under the door frame.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sami will find out.
An eyewitness is worth more than ten auditory witnesses.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis an hour a day.
Tom is a goner.
When I entered the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They did not give up hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom ironed his shirt.
Tom has gone to the library.
We have to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
This is an armchair.
Tom did not want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
OK, I'll bite.
I don't want any more!
Do you know what color she likes?
I think Tom isn't going to be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're glad.
I envy your good health.
Sure, why not?
She began to play an old song.
Why are they speaking in French?
That's a fib.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It'll soon be spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very gullible.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's turn back.
Tom isn't crazy.
Don't ever think that.
Tom is very annoying.
You're afraid?
You ruined my life.
We should invent a secret language.
Do you plan to stay long?
When do you plan to leave for Japan?
My children are in school.
I put down my suitcase.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there something you want to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
To rub salt in someone's wounds.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to swim across the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom isn't as old as you are.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Tom is quite fluent in French.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry - I'll check everything personally.
Tom dried himself with a towel.
What's happened to Tom?
This is a bracelet.
I have lots of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I was a little late.
I want the facts.
She wasn't able to defend herself.
Tom is leaving Boston next month.
Be careful. It's still warm.
Let's kiss.
Millions of people starve to death every year.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter was wrongly addressed.
It's the last train.
Who'll fight?
I found a meteorite.
I am far from happy.
Everything's fine.
They changed their religion.
I need to be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold her car.
Thanks for your hospitality.
What is he up to?
You are number one!
Aren't you ever going to do that?
We managed to save them.
He is a strange person.
I just got a haircut.
Mary said she'd never study French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our own fault.
You're so sweet.
It will cost around fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory deserves consideration.
Tom is an embarrassment.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
This pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these songs myself.
She is a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You were having fun, weren't you?
You were singing.
I nailed it.
I like to write.
Kyoto is a remarkably beautiful city.
I'll be sixteen years old next month.
Do you think there's a chance that will happen?
Embrace your dreams.
What time will your last class be over?
I've come to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I've tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How did the exam go?
Where was this book published?
Tom said that he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing that.
We need to help Tom.
It rained all day.
This made me sad.
Can I have your telephone number?
You should stop.
Tom is going to go to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to become a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun gives light by day, and the moon by night.
I have a hard-on for her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You've got the right to be happy.
What is your rating?
I've had problems with my boss.
That's a banana.
Tom will likely be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
The haze enveloped London.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you often travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe that you'll win.
She went to the airport to see him off.
Stand aside.
It's in the kitchen.
I'm begging you, don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brasilia.
What I really want to do is sleep.

That music gets on his nerves.
What languages are spoken in America?
You've earned a rest.
These are fresh.
Tom's eyes are huge.
The rainbow has seven colors.
I think Tom shouldn't do that.
He is morose today.
I would like it if we could spend more time together.
Listen to his candid opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to study very much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I agree to your proposal.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
Either you or Jane has to go there.
If I were you, I would ignore it.
Tom will be here right away.
Those are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
Do you think I'm joking?
I was very tired today.
I'm truthful.
Happiness does not consist only in having many things.
The news spread all over Japan.
Tom pointed towards the mountain.
The taxi is here.
I heard him coming downstairs.
That's mine. Give it back.
How weird!
Can you read Cyrillic?
I know Tom quite well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is tidy, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking dick.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I never could've done this without your help.
I always have coffee and toast for breakfast.
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast.
I am the best.
How was your test?
Can I pay later?
Did this just happen?
Mary didn't take an umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
The truth is I told a lie.
I'm going to bed.
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did that.

Is she hiding something?
Tom said that he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're comfortable in our new house.
Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.
She said: "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.

All the meat had spoiled.
I was born like this.
I ran a race with Tom.
He came home late in the evening.

I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She is unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was slightly confused.
He signed the check.
Hi, how's it going?
The password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take the garbage out.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They understood.
No problem!

The cloud is grey.

I'm sure of his success.
Tom isn't the one who did this.
Where is the closest subway station?

You're not hiding anything, are you?
How is it?

You can do that right now.
There's no speed limit.
Tom blushed a little.

It was my error, not Tom's.
