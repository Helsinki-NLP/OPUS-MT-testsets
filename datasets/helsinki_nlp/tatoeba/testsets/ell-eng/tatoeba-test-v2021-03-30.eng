"Did you do that on Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
She loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict about it.
Cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Choose whichever you like.
I live on Park Street.
Where is the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The kids are asleep.
You seem disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're much faster than me.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me this isn't true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom is popular.
That is very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog is white.
When will you come?
Mary is my wife.
It seems to me that someone is calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I've never been to Paris.
Tom has visited Australia three times.
It'll snow today.
I heard yelling.
No, thanks. I don't drink beer.
Tom said it was unfair.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I will fight.
Millie isn't eating an apple.
I don't like wine.
You're smarter than her.
How many did you want?
Who knows the answers?
They killed Tom.
I rarely eat out.
Kneel!
Please hurry.
You are drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France, but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
Did you invite them to the party?
We must clean our classroom.
Why are you laughing?
We have many schools.
Mary is blackmailing Tom.
She doesn't speak, she screams!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What were you eating?
We're proud of Tom.
Horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
Love what you do.
Which football team are you a fan of?
I get up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom clenched his fists.
They ate in the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, how are you?
I won't tell anyone that you're in Boston.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom is unmarried.
Will you go to Boston next week?
You seem happy today.
I want you to stay.
We'll paint it.
It's easier said than done.
She showed me her room.
When will he come?
Australia is a beautiful country.
They will fix it.
I don't care if you go or not.
It was strange.
Nobody understands it.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everybody knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than her.
Let me make my position clear.
I never understood this.
She washes her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will tell.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm texting them.
Tom left for Boston.
Tom isn't fair.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom isn't your brother.
Where are you from, my friends?
I drank a lot of coffee.
He loves to walk.
The man is young.
He's not Algerian.
My car is faster than yours.
I don't live in Boston.
All of my friends like Tom.
What does she want?
Stop your nonsense.
Our university has a good library.
My horse is white.
Tom has returned from Australia.
I'll sit with you.
I'll call you tonight.
I'm from Kyoto.
He is madly jealous of his woman.
May I have one of these?
Pass the pepper, please.
Was there anybody in the car?
This is my baby.
No one moved.
French is not an easy language.
Tom came back home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're older than her.
Didn't you hear her speaking French?
I read a book last night.
She was accused for nepotism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom just had to accept things the way they were.
How old are you? I'm twenty-six.
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was Greek.
They were mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill us all.
He did not know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom at the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
Let me make my position clear.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadian.
You bought a new house.
You never cared about me!
The thief disguised himself as a policeman.
Can I go with you till the door?
I thought we could stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be fighting all the time.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
He knew it all along.
Everything went well.
Emily asked me a question.
Tell them to come see me.
You played.
I wonder which way is faster.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol is studying Spanish.
Everybody agreed with his idea.
Come quickly.
You must stay.
I grew up in that neighborhood.

I will fight.
He is still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
She met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French into English.
It was empty.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
I have something to say.
Everyone is waiting for Tom.
Did Tom do this to you?
You must help your friends.
I won't lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You don't contribute enough.
You are my best friend.
Tom's achievements are impressive.
Give me everything you've got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me alone here.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too old for Mary.
Who invented the telephone?
He forgot to turn off the light.
Give me thirty minutes.
They seem happy.
They work hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You ruined it.
You have few books.
We're ready to help.
Your teacher asked you about what?
Tom loved Mary a lot.
Is it yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom is afraid that I'll get lost.
I'm really tired.
I want to learn guitar.
Do you like your car?
He was elected mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's now my turn.
He makes my life a living hell.
Tom gave me this tie.
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
I miss him.
Were you happy?
She is happy.
You're unbelievably stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom ill?
What do you want?
We like children.
She was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need it.
I like to dance.
You took the wrong key.
I thought Tom was a Canadian.
They were young.
She died quickly.
Are you angry?
How do you do?
Tom is a mathematician.
Are you a friend of Tom's?
How did you lose it?
Each year the world's population increases on average by two percent.
Tom was the lead suspect.
I thought you were Canadian.
I never would've thought that I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
Do you speak Hebrew?
Who did Tom sell his car to?
You're very curious.
Come here right now.
They're speaking French.
We must finish everything before Monday morning.
Yes, certainly.
Your husband is cheating on you.
Tom is obedient.
Merchants only look at the profits.
She married him for his money.
Many people around the world love spicy food.
Mary plays the piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to bed now.
I want to live in Brazil.
Do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English is not my native language.
May I have your phone number, please?
Leave it there.
He has his faults, but I still like him.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I'm always listening to music; I can't live without it.
It will be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom is really quiet.
She made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
I got up at seven this morning.
What in the world does Tom mean?
He is a quiet person.
I hurried to the bus stop so I wouldn't miss the last bus.
Tom told me Mary was in jail.
I'm fine, thanks for asking!
I saw Tom last Monday walking in the park with Mary.
They have sold the television.
If you have something to say, say it.
This house is not very big.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I am rich.
Will you marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept at ten o'clock yesterday.
You still haven't told me who you are.
I have as many books as Tom does.
I like this song.
You are a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me one more chance.
There are a bunch of books on the table. Are they yours?
We have to find the right person for each position.
Think first!
What about you? Do you trust this man?
Who will count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't approach the dog.
Yes, I'm coming!
Tom misses his wife and their children.
Where did you go last Sunday?
Keep both hands on the steering wheel.
She made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was he born?
This is unprecedented.
No one ever came to see me in the hospital.
You aren't thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's a lot of fun to listen to music.
I believe Tom is right.
Life is short, though a smile only lasts a second.
I now know the truth.
My mother came.
Betty came last.
Did he admit it?
You never seem to spend much time helping others.
Wait. I want to tell you something.
The next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know lots of pilots.
We were struggling to survive.
We're not afraid.
Do you want this?
You aren't yourself.
They were yours.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is an amazing country.
They're smiling.
"Did he kiss you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on the deck.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.
Are you still living on Park Street?
Unlock the door.
He's so young.
Tom and Mary live together, but they're not legally married.
We went to a nice restaurant.

Nonsense!
I just did what Tom asked me to do.

That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
No one knows how it works.
You look tired.
We were both very hungry.

Are you alive?
He is a good singer.

The streets are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I don't see you.

I assumed you were Canadian.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I would like you to stay with me.

Rejection hurts.
I hope that continues.

What were you telling them?
Come with me to Boston.
Do you swim often?
I felt nervous with so many people watching me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom dyed his hair black.
Yes, I'm coming immediately.

I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came over and cooked dinner for me.

When did you buy it?
Tell him to leave.
We want to cause the least possible harm.
We were born on the same day.
You're indecisive.
She promised me that she'd come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, it means that you can speak one language!
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I've always dreamed of going to Australia.
