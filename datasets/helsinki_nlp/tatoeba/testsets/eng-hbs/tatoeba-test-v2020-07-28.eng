What's your story?
Get started.

I have been looking for you.
That's going to take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?

These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?

You look really pale. Are you all right?
She hesitated for a second.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
Can I ask you a question?
I want us to be more than friends.
Could you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things must pass.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
Tom was so cold his teeth were chattering.
What is your name?
Where is your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I drive you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he wanted my help.
Without a doubt!
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use a hand.
It was love at first sight.
Hold on.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom is still frustrated.
I would like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that I shouldn't do that.
Infrared and ultra-violet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have downloaded that.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher" they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets mad, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you've written.
There is almost no violence in that city.
They already have one.
There's really no need for you to do that.
Is your watch correct?
I hope that the weather will be dry.
Could you have a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches tomorrow?
No fewer than 50 passengers were killed.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
I know everything.
How could I help it?
I bought lots of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Bring it in, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
Education in this world disappoints me.
The first thing my mother said was: "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Marija bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I hear only you.
It is rare for him to get angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
How do we know that he's innocent?
Have you washed the dishes?
After he came back from service in Afghanistan, Tom was plagued by flashbacks and nightmares.
I've decided.
My hands are cold.
Thank you very much!
The best lecture that you can attend is the one you won't understand.
That won't have an effect.
Don't stare.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom suggested should save us all a little time.
Italy is a peninsula.
Wonderful!
He's rather busy just now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That is his car.
Of course!
Tom is boiling the potatoes to make potato salad.
Everybody stayed.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife Edita.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you managed to do that.
Be that as it may, you are wrong.
It is difficult to give up a long love suddenly.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I've got a white horse.
Good luck!
Let's discuss this over lunch.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company is on the rocks because of bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Does that price include breakfast?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates foreigners.
Go screw yourself!
We must respect the rights of the individual.
What is that thing in your right hand?
May I call around 2:30?
Anybody wanna go to Disneyland with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write this kind of song.
It really is that easy.
It was a silly mistake.
What do you eat, anyway?
Don't speak.
Call it what you like.
Don't put the cart before the horse.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he was unable to.
Yumi will become a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
It wasn't important to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy here for me.
Tom must've tried cleaning this without using soap.
It rained so hard that we decided to visit him on another day.
I'm glad that Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom that you love him before it's too late.
His unkindness made her angry.
She rejected my proposal.
The trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
In that case, let's go.
Tom wrote Mary a long letter, but he didn't send it to her.
He is good at gymnastics.
He has a good memory.
Tom has been fired.
Cold numbs the limbs.
Tom isn't very nice.
Diamond cuts diamond.
I really needed Tom there.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Have you ever known Tom to lie?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I am proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's rather busy just now.
Who is this person?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists are ignorant of that fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom looked very puzzled.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is the lake?
What is the year of your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about that.
You're too young.
Don't slouch.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
Come here.
Tom'll know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed them.
Did I ask you?
You mustn't touch it.
I've seen enough for now.
Look back!
Be kind.
What should I see?
It stinks.
Nine pounds of gold was needed to gild the victory medals.
I will eat supper at seven.
Give me the sword.
He isn't smart enough to add up numbers in his head.
Watch over me, I will watch over you.
You have to trust me.
I think your plan is not realistic.
Are you acquainted with the man?
Would you talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We must act at once.
I do not fear death, but dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him for ages.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her for ages.
I've never actually ever met Tom.
Don't yell.
This is one of a kind.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
We'll just follow you.
To know oneself is very difficult.
Save your energy. You're going to need it later.
That was a good experience.
Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You've just been shot.
My income has decreased ten percent.
You'll see her.
Unfamiliar terrain can be difficult to traverse.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Yum. Fried cheese.
Fine, you don't have to.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After long reflection, I decided to take things as they come.
It's right.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen a lot?
They strolled along the beach.
We're downsizing.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the television.
I wear short-sleeve shirts in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom hoped that he would become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems that he'd written when he was a teenager.
Where is the Avis counter?
Don't hog the road.
Tom might be able to tell us how to do that.
I was just heading out.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come on in here.
Tomorrow I'm going back home.
I think you're stupid to do that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad about lying.
They told me to wait here.
I am not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's job is to prove that her client is innocent.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom'll remember.
Why not just tell Tom?
If there is no porn of it, porn will be made of it.
Canada is the motherland of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom is saving money so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You guys can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave Tom that.
I'm glad that Tom won.
Fine. And you?
This is, without a doubt, an embarrassing situation for me.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road goes to the city.
I'm not happy with it.
I burnt my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't speak.
We had a terrible fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start studying.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find the book in the library.
The police recovered the stolen money.
I've never noticed that before.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
Fantastic!
I didn't do that either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk with Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell good.
It was obvious Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
It is a table.
Flowers bloom.
How unfortunate!
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm tired of arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
What will you do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't yell.
I cannot stop thinking of the stolen money.
You've missed the boat.
Come and see us.
The young man is often foolhardy.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anybody.
They needed one another.
Let's get something to eat.
Do you think so?
Can't we just agree to disagree?
I'm trying to be cautious.
When it comes to my child, the trouble never ends.
Not yet.
Her wish is to study abroad someday.
Check this.
Come quickly!
Where is my suitcase?
He wishes to erase bad memories.
You are absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water to it.
Music is important to me.
I worked on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Easy does it.
No one has a soul.
I pretended that I didn't know what was going on.
Where there is grass, there is no water. Where there is water, there is no grass.
My friend scored 95 on the maths exam.
Tom wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Today I have a lot of things to do.
You're in for trouble.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
There is no word for liberty in the Russian language.
I thought you'd be busy.
It's shiny.
Could it be true?
Keep it down, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I arrived.
Tell us a ghost story!
I hope Tom is safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What'll you be doing this summer?
I've tried to stop multitasking.
Let's make a break for it.
That must've been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll phone her tonight.
I've had to make some tough choices.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is a base.
Check again.
Are you being truthful?
That made perfect sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I must do.
Open your mouth!
I wasn't told anything.
The fire had spread to the next building before the firemen came.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
The bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought a newspaper.
That one's for me, too.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never take me alive!
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's about time you went to bed.
Give me one dollar for the book.
Shut up and sit down.
What is this?
He took off his clothes.
Tom fell back to sleep.
Don't move!
He is American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
Make no mistake about it.
The first lesson is easy.
You sure got fat fast.
Tom'll succeed.
I got off the train.
We are brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at multitasking.
Nobody's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She is in a bad mood.
Will I be the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination run wild.
Good. And you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You may not enter that room.
What have you done to me?
Everything's here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
If you do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have gotten involved with your hair-brained scheme.
The light went out by itself.
Tom begged Mary to give him one more chance.
Ask a policeman!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We've been cooperative.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom has been saving up to buy a yacht.
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You drive me crazy.
What do the papers say?
After three years of work by volunteers, the system has been fully repaired.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in the white house.
A new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road connection to Oslo and eastern Norway for the entire western region.
You let me down.
Good day, how are you?
She received four e-mails.
I'm really happy about it.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are plotting something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom was able to find Mary's house without any problem.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just won't do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It is their right to vote.
I find it difficult to express my meaning in words.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
Turn right at the next corner.
My mother is cooking for me.
I'm trying to be cautious.
The woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope my mistake will escape his notice.
I must've eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows that I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom is working too hard.
Stay away from thinner addicts.
That's the one I liked.
He didn't hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller coasters?
We ran out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
The weather is good today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You've no idea how right you are.
Tom and I've been busy.
Workers of all lands, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
Tom is an easy guy to get along with.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends had teased her.
You've got the right to be happy.
I think no one knows.
You must work more.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was pacing in his room, unable to calm himself down.
Would you mind giving me a hug?
I found the cage empty.
Take a break, Tom.
What does he mean to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you drop around sometime?
She's asking how that's possible.
Santa lives at the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please leave.
Take a look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
I was trying to be nice.
Mary is a wedding planner.
Houston, we've had a problem here.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything that you want.
That book is theirs.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends had teased her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You need to come home.
Alice smiled.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn on the light?
I'll save you!
I'll keep you updated.
We can look at a suit-clad Tom at a black grand piano, moving his fingers dramatically, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds knocked down a lot of tree branches last night.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
We have to set the scene for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 pupils in this class.
They laughed at his mistake.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time for you to get up.
The house was built of bricks.
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
I got off at the wrong station.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
People were nice to me.
I know that this is weird.
Tom is now out of sight.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried it?
Dr. Jackson has a good bedside manner.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I bum a cigarette off you?
I could go with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
How many blankets are there on the bed?
There's really no need for you to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I am cooking the lunch.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
I'm fat.
To join the choir, you have to be able to read music.
Tom was half asleep.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I take vitamins every day.
I'll call back a bit later.
Why me?
Clearly, I was overly optimistic.
Tom cooks for us.
We live in a house.
Haven't you finished yet?
You're very rude.
He gets a good salary.
Tom says that he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's just the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She allowed me to go.
It is very natural for a human being that one always give himself precedence over the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
Everything's OK.
Do you think Tom is the one who broke the window?
I have a lot of stuff planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
They made him captain of the team.
Why are you still up? You should get to bed.
I was present at school yesterday.
Tom does what is asked of him.
I'm still on the clock.
Callous, unemotional children can sometimes become adult sociopaths.
I'd like you to have it.
The police's job is to prevent and investigate crime.
Could you pass me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom is learning very quickly.
You're different.
Hating others is foreign to her.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves soccer.
What time can you come?
Monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him any more.
Keep children away from medicine.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I could be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game may have been put off till next week.
I have a soul.
Driving for one and a half hours to get to work is a bear.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea that I'd be here.
This is not important.
Tom is in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm neutral.
I turned around.
I had completely forgotten to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
It's here.
I'll make something up.
It all began a year ago when he returned home.
Play it again, Sam.
Do you drink coffee?
Some of us find such views to be sheer madness.
It works.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't even write one letter to Mary while he was away.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know that Tom is guilty.
She's Chinese.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
We need to be prudent.
I'll be around back.
Take a look at these.
He needs her.
Remember to renew your passport.
I think Tom got a raw deal.
I bet Tom never spoke to you like that.
I've changed.
I am more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a little ill.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom is OK.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I'm soaked to the bone.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great difficulty.
I will go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's not a reason to panic.
I scored 20 on the maths exam.
The most dangerous headaches are caused by deficiently digested ideas.
I'm really happy I'm here.
What're you looking at?
I still do not understand anything.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Examine this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake one, right?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is unfazed.
It's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Please help us track this card.
Do you know the difference between silver and tin?
Put your hands up!
I don't exercise as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anybody.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
To put it briefly, I do not agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You don't date, do you?
She is a teacher.
You can't live without water.
I used to play piano long ago, so I can still play a little.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
The mother and daughter represented two generations.
At last, we have arrived!
It's in good hands.
He makes it a rule to work in the garden for two hours every day.
One gives away apples and pears, and not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The teacher's pronunciation is almost perfect.
Is there something in particular that you want to learn?
I really love working out.
I love you!
I'm real proud of that.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
That doesn't sound like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
The craziness has crossed a line.
Is it not black?
This is not a book for children.
You're right on the money.
Come, sit by me.
We know we're better than that.
Tell me about it!
Let's not discuss this now.
Have fun.
It's time to say goodbye.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I like dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The report on the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What do you eat, anyway?
I don't like to be judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
Man hopes as long as he lives.
Take care.
Let's discuss our options.
Don't worry! If you help me, everything will be fine.
My jaw dropped.
That was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We try.
Why is this our problem?
Tom can handle this.
Go and have a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Urgh..." "So hey, you remember that one that she sent you where she asked you to get her those pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yeah." "And then she told you to write a critique on Mac's physical appearance." "Yeah." "Then she sent the critique to Mac." "...Yeah." "What did you tell her you learned from that?" "I found that a Phillips screwdriver is persuasive, but not seductive; and also Rarity charges up the butt for stuff I really think she should do as a friend."
I've always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I don't want to take up much of your time.
I only go to church out of duty to my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
"Did he say why?" "He did."
Not every lamp is magic.
Tom won't be able to answer those questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You shouldn't eat just before you go to bed.
Tom'll wait.
What will happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students didn't know how they should answer.
He is ashamed of telling lies.
I'm not a night person.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
Nice to see you again.
Tom bought a VIP pass.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should be doing that.
Tom'll call.
He had lit the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anybody.
This is quite a place.
I don't live with Tom.
I've heard that Tom has dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom'll understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room here.
There is some truth in what Tom says.
You said nothing wrong.
I'm tired of your whining.
Get out!
We have two television sets.
We like to play soccer.
Step aside.
The horse must have stumbled and have toppled the knight.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands in the sea.
I'm looking into that right now.
Mini-skirts are back in fashion again.
What exactly are we looking for?
She achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he likes as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said that he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up a little!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medicine will soothe your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Give me a break.
Tom likes them both.
We sat together in silence for some time.
You're looking very well.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
He's addicted to Starbucks coffee.
The book is on the table.
The two sides hold talks this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Cardboard is stronger than paper.
Why did you shave off your beard?
Tom isn't a good writer.
Fadil had second thoughts.
I've never noticed that before.
Stuff happens.
We know who he is.
I need a taxi!
I saw the cat.
I'm plastered.
Mother has just gone out shopping.
It is hers, is it not?
I am proud of you.
I get nervous at immigration.
Tom needs to be helped.
Defend yourself.
He took a taxi to the hospital.

Tom asked me who I thought would win the race.
Man has many wishes that he does not really wish to fulfil, and it would be a misunderstanding to suppose the contrary. He wants them to remain wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfilment would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally, and yearn for death.

Tom has gotten married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He is a scientist.
You are not allowed to go into that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his tiny bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope that you like it.
Welcome back.
She'll return very soon.
Enjoy it while you can.
Tom is a philistine.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What do you plan to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Could anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll get the job done.
It's time for the truth.
That doesn't concern us.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It really is quite bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brutus?
The home where Atatürk was born is in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It snows.
I thought you might need help.
Does this make sense?

He has two cars.
That was three months ago.

Let's hear your excuse.
My dad said no.
They formed a swim team.
Tom delivered the package to the orphanage.
Continue digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog lay down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
No.
Go find something else to do.
They aren't mine.
I'm ready!
You aren't going to leave me, are you?
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve the project. It leaves much to be desired.
Are you texting Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary is a soccer mom.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
The little flowers open at night.
I counted to two hundred.
I tried to persuade Tom to come home.
Someday you should give it a try.
I'll stay at home with my grandparents this weekend.
What have you concluded?
I've been praying for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom is a bundle of nerves.
The bathroom is upstairs.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom has tricked you.
Tom is a bookworm.
It is only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in a hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals wantonly mistreated animals.
I'll live in Cambodia.
Until when shall you tell us off?
Please stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
I'll teach you how to play the ukulele if you want me to.
I'm used to it now.
It's not all that bad.
She seems to have been offended by what he said.
I like to play music written by my friends.
Tom admitted that.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak louder than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
Stop!
It's difficult to work with you.
Tom has put on weight.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
I'm guilty.
Don't respond.
Bring wine.
Things are not always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
A few old buildings need to be demolished.
What've you been doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I am so tired that I can't study.
I never saw his face.
Tom is very cautious.
What time will you be leaving?
This report is very sloppily written.
I want a new bike.
She points out that this latest gesture of the government has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It lasted about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
Five brothers worked together on the farm.
It could be a trick.
The firm is known for its high-quality products.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's accusation.
Tell me what this is.
Thanks for accepting my friend request on Facebook.
His hair almost covered his whole face.
How could I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to shovel the snow off your roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who falsified his diploma to get into college has been sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Have you washed the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually seem happy?
The essay itself isn't a problem, but all these pernicious questions and glossary make me awfully mad!
The weekend is here.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I want to see her very much.
It was a lucky guess.
I thought Tom was awesome.
I had never seen anything like that before.
I buy loads of stuff at that store.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I wish you were here with me.
Take a sip of this.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
He began to shout.
I'll come when I have done my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Were you able to do that by yourself?
Don't push.
Can we give this a try?
Most people like chicken.
Has Tom gone insane?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's watch that again.
The last time I went to the beach, I got badly sunburned.
Step back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch it there, Tom.
We have fixed some damage from rocks flying onto your car.
I became a retiree after working for forty-five years in a cubicle.
Why are you curious all of a sudden?
His girlfriend was not supportive.
I just took a bath.
Am I under suspicion?
Fortunately, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
In general, children are fond of candy.
Tom'll cry.
We need you to help us.
I think we've had enough to eat.
You startled us.
Are you ready for more?
Just give it a chance.
Tom is upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I help it?
Gold is far heavier than water.
The telephone is one wonderful device.
Tom is afraid of death.
I'm not able to fix the car by myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I'm not buying it.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Don't let anybody in.
What would Tom think?
Let's not get into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely got a raw deal.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He is second to none.
Nothing's wrong with me.
Tom is obviously sick.
I began to study English when I was twelve years of age. At that time I was interested in languages, but not excessively so. Now I can speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; and so it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need a sincere girlfriend.
She is a beginner.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
Tom won't get away.
I'd leave.
I don't take bribes.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you remember might help.
You'll get better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
That's nothing you need to worry about.
I understand that they are a thorn in the eye to people like you, but this is simply pathetic.
Tom'll manage.
There's no free lunch.
So what if I am gay? Is it a crime?
He will certainly come, nevertheless.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do so much.
Friends, can I talk with you for a minute?
It's a fact of life.
What's your full name?
I understood.
We're lucky, aren't we?
I feel like crying.
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be done soon.
One learns by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom is the one you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anybody there?
Be that as it may, you are wrong.
They won't take it away.
There is no rule without exception.
You may need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in that garden.
No one said anything.
The book is on the table.
He's a genuine aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
All is quiet again.
I've failed.
We know.
Tom goes to school for graphic design.
He lied to you.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
Music is his passion.
You should face up to the reality.
Light waves travel through space and various kinds of materials.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed.
How much is this?
I want you to talk to Tom about that.
We do have some options.
This should do the trick.
She hated him.
As for me, I don't object to your point of view.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It's just what happens.
Have some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
All this running has made me hungry.
I am a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider tickles me.
Speak about others as you would want them to speak about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I say it's OK.
Whatever do you mean?
You changed my life.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Reaction is not always the best course of action.
I won't tell anybody that you did that.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
The Committee recommended that those complaining should be reimbursed with a proportionate share of the annual fee with interest.
Tom was playing for time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time for you to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
It's my money, too.
That's water under the bridge.
Tom's distracted.
Recall the filename before you try to perform file recovery.
I'm trying to be cautious.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's just get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is genuine Russian vodka!
I wasn't nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.

We won't let you die.
I'm good at many things.
Tom wants to teach his children the value of work.
Tom has always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of Boston's best attorneys.
How much will I receive?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
What do you think, how long has Tom been preparing for the exam?
A book descriptive of the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Have you got a dog?
He breathed his last breath.
I tried to talk Tom into coming home.
I'd be up for that.
You mustn't touch it.
Don't quibble.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Is Tom getting a raw deal?
Give me all your money.
Mary was very supportive.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We called Robert "Bob".
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to get an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They are teachers.
The government collapsed after a vote in parliament.
You are not funny.
Tom went instead of Mary.
The notebook is not yours. It's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car along the street.
I'm not good at Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I am waiting my turn.
That's not the main issue.
I felt very troubled by the news.
The girl is eating bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom requested help.
That's not exactly right.
They know you.
I passed every single test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I will kill you!
I was as cool as a cucumber.
It's no good waiting for something to happen; you must take action at once.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could've gone, but I didn't want to.
It snowed yesterday.
We strolled through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom keeps a spare key hidden in his garden.
Let's pretend we are aliens.
Tom is sure to win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
A man's home is his castle.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
Even if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Stop that!
We were studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this by parcel post?
What is it you propose?
They say love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I've just been too busy.
Were you talking about me?
The sky became darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did all we could do.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
Some strange people keep knowledge of a language secret.
I have no intention of changing.
They moved ahead slowly.
Why is love so difficult?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I am too late, right?
Don't stare.
Blue suits you well.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom is worried about what might happen.
He was an honest man.

There was something lying on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think that Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She shouted to him, but he didn't hear her.
Water is life.
What are you going to do today?
He is likely to win the championship.
After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It ain't over till it's over.
Tom still seems anxious.
I haven't seen a thing.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom has no such problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You have a hard day ahead of you.
It's fine.
Does this mean that you love me?
It really is quite bad.
I'll pass.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Justice must be done.
Tom and Mary would make a lovely couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay in tonight.

People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
There goes our bus. Now we'll have to walk.
I'm going to release you.
I support your comments wholeheartedly.
I'll try to persuade Tom to help us.
What about putting together a group on Facebook so we can discuss studying foreign languages?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we have an agreement?
It's not all that bad.
Let's talk in the hall.
Could you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom took off that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't do it either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
Can I see your ticket?
What will happen now?
Be careful. This knife is really sharp.
They furnished the library with new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typo.
Your book is double the size of mine.
We're both not as rich as we wish we were.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It is absurd to idle away the student life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has unruly hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's the one I hate.
We will miss you terribly if you leave Japan.
Tell me what'll happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look at it.
Tom was eating a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is rising.
I admit that I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
I think Tom could do that.
I need five more minutes.
He's sleeping like a baby.

How is that your fault?
My telephone number is 9876-5432.

Mayuko avoided doing hard work.
She has short hair.
Drive slowly.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.

You're not allowed to talk to her.
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I could use a beer.
You are not funny.
Everybody looks up to Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a huge success.
Sit back down, please.
Does that happen a lot?

I didn't manage to see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well enough.
I'm glad people saw it.
You need to talk to me.

I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?

Tom isn't fussy.
Control yourselves.

Tom seemed a bit angry.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh yes! Tomorrow I will have something to do.
Nobody cares for me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
Yesterday I was not at home the whole day.
I would be thankful to you if you stayed until tomorrow.

We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we nearly there?
I am not a prophet.
I'm sure the two of you will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Does that make you angry?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We are from Russia.
Fees are about to go up.

Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
And they all lived happily ever after.
Tom blushed.
Tom carried the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Have you seen it work?
Is that a yes or no?

My car is in the garage.
Give me another example.

The room was dark.
He is going home.
It could be a weapon.
Put the book on the top shelf.
He is sleepy.
I'm not able to fix the car by myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later his lips curved in a malicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for her course deteriorated when her favourite lecturer transferred interstate.
I didn't mean to be rude.
Mary was not worthy of your trust.
I'm guessing you already know the answer to that.

I barely slept a wink.
What would I do without you?
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
I don't have anybody except her.
You're inconsiderate.
Tom isn't going to be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
It is new.
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
I'm going to go take a nap.
What else could I have done?
Stay away from my woman.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?

Why do you think so?
I am Death.

Are we safe now?
Who out of your friends will come?
Could you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom dance many times.
They work together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you dancing.
I am a student.
This is my email address.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She is making a mountain out of a molehill.
You told me not to lie.
He was a member of a social elite rather than the masses.
I'm terrified.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a wealthy man.
Can you read that sign ahead of us?
I'm glad that you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pencil.
Your answer is wrong.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to what is best, as it will always be dependent on the individual and the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be vigilant.
I'll probably never use this again.
I don't have a ticket.
Bye!
He is American.
You seem like a very smart person.
It's incredible.

Do I usually seem happy?
Tom lives in Paris.
I've already written my part of the report.
You are human.
I was prepared for that.
Show me your documents.
It is related to the fact that ...
It can hardly be a matter of passion. Perhaps it's just about sex.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
I drew an ace.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom'll pay.
Tom lost his job.
Hunting season is over.
I love Kabyle cooking.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
Did Tom give it to you?
She spends her holidays at her uncle's.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom nearby?
Ladies first.
I'm motivated.
What is your name?
How tragic!
We're here.
It's mine, not his.

Why do you need so many shoes?
Everything you have will have you someday.
No matter how busy Tom gets, he never forgets to write an email to his mother at least once a week.
They may need some money.

This is the life.
The situation is dire.
They quarreled.
The early bird catches the worm.
Do we have one like it?
Is this your suitcase?
It's all Greek to me.
This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
Tom paused a second.
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
Examine them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not worried that much.
Come on up, Tom.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Do you have time to eat lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's doable.
Tom thinks that I don't know what he said.
I'm gonna go take a nap for an hour.
I'm quite happy now.
It is as warm today as yesterday.
He was first subjected to a preliminary test with the new electronic breathalyzer before he was sent for a laboratory test.

Check around.
Come to my house.
It was a stressful day.
Her name is Lucifera.
Stop moving!
Is it clean?
Are those your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom watched from nearby.
Please let us help you.
I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom couldn't speak French.

How much will I receive?
Who wears the pants in your family?
What the fuck?
Tom is on a top secret mission.
I want to be with you.

I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
Check everyone.
I was sick and had to stay indoors.
The session has been prorogued.
I baked bread.
I have a lot of stuff planned for tomorrow.

What does she look like?

I've never noticed that before.
I must sleep.
Tom usually gets to school earlier than any other student in his class.

Why?

Wisdom is necessary to understand wisdom: music does not exist to a deaf audience.

Get everything.
Are those your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not a hundred percent sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
That kid kept crying for hours.
I'd like to buy that one.
That is going too far.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't speak.
French is his mother tongue.
Her words angered him.
I laughed.
It hasn't been too hot.
I don't have any money.
I almost forgot my passport.
I have been looking for you.
Tom is a bookworm.

During an experiment on powers of observation, Tom was unable to describe any of the pictures hanging on his living room wall, despite having lived in his unit for two years.
I've never seen Tom so busy.
You don't seem to be yourself these days.
It's a pretty good one.
I was certainly lucky.
I hope that's the truth.
I wonder who this sentence belongs to.
Tom was playing for time.
Everyone's holding their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
That isn't funny at all.
I called him.

Are you prepared to take responsibility?
What did you like best on the trip?
I love watching you work.

Translating is not nearly as easy as many people might think.
Tom would never admit that.
That was just the beginning.
Is your homework finished?
I've been doing research over the last few days about how I might make money from the project, but I think all my options will require a severe shift in the way I live, which is a tricky thing.
Is everything OK between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was excellent.
I have to plan everything.
Let's drop the subject.
We counted the growth rings on the tree that we cut down and found out that it was thirty years old.
See you around, Tom.
Do you want fruit juice?
Let's set up a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get one?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
I am a very sad man.
Boston is a great town.
We hope people like it.
They may leave tomorrow.
Come here. I want to show you something.

He still has no experience for this job.
Can you give us a hand?
Would you take it easy?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could've gone, but I didn't want to.
I had second thoughts.
Based on the information that I've given you, what story would you come up with?
Who can't be proud of being Serbian, part of a group whose greatest historical achievements have been slaughtering authority figures and genocides?
That makes it easier.
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
Are you going to invite her to the party?
Huh? Where'd I put the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom has lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
He doesn't miss anything.
Tom will take a look at it.
I was wondering if anyone could help me. I have a mobile phone that only displays an error message.
I'm astonished.
Everybody smiled.
I miss him.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
Tom played his highest card.

Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Won't you have another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
Who's she?
I bought this yesterday.
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
The children are playing outside.
Nothing is wrong with you.
Do whatever you want. I don't care.
She expects us to help her.
Who are you?
Call me anytime. I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Am I being fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
It's fine.
I don't mean to nag you.
Tell me what'll happen.
Tom has seen enough.
Thanks for coming!
What is your blood type?
Are we starting soon?
I found him the book.
They sell sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.

This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute no matter what she wears.
Shit happens.
Look out!
Tom couldn't produce any evidence to back his statement up.
Why would Tom come now?

I was happy yesterday.
Tom could tell by the way Mary slammed the door that she was upset.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary.
What would you like to know?
Now is not a very good time.
He is no longer a child.
I try to air my futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me what I am.

Put the book on the top shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He is very learned.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He had once again drunk one over the eight.
Is that what it takes?
Get everything.
You've tried.

I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
Mama! That lady and man are holding hands, they're great friends aren't they!

Take care.
There may be something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You are the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We're here for the day.
You know I can't give out that kind of information.
I'm not the one who did that.
I have a few friends.
I have to go find her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was taken aback.
Just one moment, please.
We can get one for you.
Tom wants to know when you'll be finished.
Call me.
Tom still seems shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Which one is easier?
Tom put in for a raise.
Fadil wasn't inside the house.

What should you do?
I always liked Tom better.
Where has Tom been hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on the way to work.
I've got some brownies.
Take a look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're being ridiculous.
Are Tom and Mary really engaged?
Horses sleep standing up.
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories tells, among other things, how Christianity was spread in Norway by force.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students didn't know how they should answer.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to persuade Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I tripped.
I assumed that you were busy.
Who are you running from?
That elegant gold plated chain with hearts is a necklace that will "rock your world".
Your answer is right.
I love Leanne.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
A heavy rain fell.

We heard her cry.
It's been a great help.
You don't need to shout. I'm not deaf.
Give me another example.
Tom still has some time.
We have no options.
Baseball is boring.
Tom has been most than generous.
She's violent right now. It'd be better to avoid her.

I'll pay him a visit within a few weeks.

Dear God, people really find it difficult when they have to point out one thing or another about you, such as your attitudes or your appearance.
Don't be late.
What? What did you say?
Tom could do better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel as if I've been thrown into oblivion.
Do you guys get along?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still here?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
This story tells us an interesting fact.
"Yes, orange juice please," says Mike.
I'm not coming along.
Take care.
May I interrupt you a while?
I hate science.
The students didn't know how to give an answer.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you.
It's the thought that counts.
I've already thought about that.

Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking.
Where's the beach?
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
Welcome.
We don't know for sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.

This can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's fine.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
What did you do it for?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun. I don't want to do this.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Check again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe Maria is best suited to take over as leader. But Tom will abstain from voting.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll do well.
She returned from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What will happen now?
I've brought a cup of coffee.
Step aside.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Someone called.
Be vigilant.
Winter is snow time.
Under what name?
What do you want to do about Tom?
Good morning. How are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who will come with us?
It sounds like you learned a valuable lesson.
Who are you really?
Easy come, easy go.
Give him time.
Everything comes to him who waits.
I would have said yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm thirty.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is it with you?
The doctor gave her a thorough check-up.
At that instant it exploded with a great noise.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population is supplied with potable water from surface water sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What is she drinking?
Those tears are artificial.
Tom is quite mean.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read it?
Try again.
That's perfectly normal.
How is your life?
It is said that a new restaurant was constructed.
The cost of the book is five dollars.
I want a sword like this!
Are you good at keeping secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.

Are you going to help me?
Good morning. How are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?

She went out for a walk.
Are there any other possibilities?
The payment for labor and return on invested capital was several millions.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm paying.
How many books do you have?
I'm not doing it alone.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
I don't completely agree with you.
Today is a beautiful day.
Are you saving this seat for someone?
How have you been doing?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think that we, women, have an extra sense.

I don't read novels.
I thought that was my job.
I am a professor.
Tom said he's no expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
No wonder Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I've written anyone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom shut off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Have you written your report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Could you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English isn't better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours at a stretch.
I hope that I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom has decided to sell his car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four French classes a week.
Let's start right away.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've trained for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.

Sami is our only hope.
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom is upstairs.

I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was the type of presentation which appeals to the audience.
Let me tell you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom is out of practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's a quarter to two.
I think you should take the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained an advantage over all other civilizations 500 years ago.
It appeared to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom shooed the flies away.
He quit smoking cold turkey.
I can't remember what I had to eat yesterday.
Tom is never here in the morning.
Even children know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to take back what she said.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat's black and the dog's white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup is on the table.
That makes me so angry.
Is it still light out?
I'm not hiding from anybody.
Many birds are on the branch.
I don't have a cellphone anymore.
Do not thank me.
I assumed that you were busy.
Is that agreeable?
Would you like me to see you home?
You must control yourself.
What is the difference?
I recognized him at first glance.
The French are our friends.
That is very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what business is it of yours?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom was able to get into the house through a window.
I saw the cat.
She does not speak English.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I have no idea what he has in mind, rejecting such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
What does it feel like?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You've tried.
My dog is blind, but he loves to go out for a walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs and potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good child, you need to go to bed and get up early.
Good. And you?
I am thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a couch potato.
This is how it should have been.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom is a nerd.
The future looked bleak for Edmond Dantes after he became the victim of a conspiracy, and he was convicted for treason and imprisoned for life.
You're being irrational.
My French is crappy.
Somehow we survived.
She covered up her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we wish we were.
It stinks.
Could you tell Tom that I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of those.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I taught myself French.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You are one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
He's got one foot in the grave.
Tom told me just the opposite.
Speak up!
Bill is my junior by two years.
I'm not unsympathetic.
Tom is displeased.
That would be a treat.
He is as nutty as a fruitcake.
Sorry I haven't replied to your letter earlier.
Do not drink the water in the dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang for you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me in the least.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone came.
Tom asked me if I had slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom looked a bit sick.
Here's a photo of her.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I will contact you as soon as I arrive.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
I'm glad.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It looks quite different around here than it used to.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbits' ears big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help out.
I know how to do that.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom really is an idiot.
Yes.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I've got my eye on you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That one is very rare.
What did I just do?
The best way is to take things as they come.
You are working too hard. Sit down and take it easy for a while.
This one's pretty cool.
Don't say a word.
I enjoyed it very much.
Tom can be trusted to some degree.
You are a teacher.
I bought lots of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife is from Kedah.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Pardon, I am late to the meeting.
What we need is a responsible government. What we have is a clown show.
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river seems shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this essay.
It's 5:00 a.m. here in Brazil.
Tom predicted that Mary would do that.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom has been arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's quite a secret.
Mary said that she would reveal all of her employer's secrets if he did not raise her wage.
They don't teach you that in school.
Is it clean?
I can't be bothered to go out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Come out of there.
Fish cannot live out of water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I am so busy that I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Get a move on!
Please wait a while longer.
I'm not going to do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They are good people.
She is a singer.
I love watching you dance.
Well done!
I try.
I was certainly lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom may chicken out.
I just want to get away.
Dania continued to follow Fadil's lead.
It has a great many words borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
I'm angry with Tom.
Every other day Bill goes fishing.
Don't let such a good opportunity go by.
At what time do you eat breakfast?
Take care.
He is in his first year at college.
I asked for grape juice.
I thought about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
Can I use your dictionary?
My fluency is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my — often contradictory — emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I am a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom is a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often experience palpitations of the heart.
Tom is on a top secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm scared of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photographs!
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to always be bothering you.
Tom is going for broke.
He is a man of power.
Terrific!
I'm ticklish.
Can you give us a lift?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we prevent that from happening?
His novels are popular among young people.
There is a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon. What type of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was amazed to hear the news.
He is not an American but an Englishman.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
There've been no injuries.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
I'll be right upstairs.
We've got to take off.
Tom is a mechanic.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very nice boy.
Tom is upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he loves to go out for a walk.
Like most eighteen-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right thigh bone in a bicycling accident Sunday in France.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Tom is a bundle of nerves.
Never give up hope.
It sounds simple, I know.
That was just icing on the cake.
How long has it been since you gave up teaching at that school?
Tom looked very puzzled.
The results were amazing.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
The tires squealed.
Are you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll obey.
The job has already been done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a fish.
Don't move!
The incident happened to be captured on video by a bystander.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known that Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
In China, there's a saying that you can't judge a person by appearance.
It's futile.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's home is in Connecticut, while the right side is in New York.
They needed one another.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are some indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be a bit more subdued this year.
Have you reported it to the police?
He gave in.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Introduce me to Tom.
After long reflection, I decided to take things as they come.
You owe me big time.
He is a man of few words.
I'm very sorry about this.
Tom came over to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's so true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one of those.
You're right on the money.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom was out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom comes to visit us every now and then.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
Tom is unmerciful.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
I exaggerated.
Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put his book down.
This should do the trick.
You let me down.
You shouldn't judge a man by his appearance.
That's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for your email!
I pretended that I didn't know what was happening.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
What is that?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea that I'd be here.
Tom told me that he won't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
A team is only as strong as its weakest member.
I've already been there.
Me, too.
That is different than what I had expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The children are asleep.
That was very good.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
And like many small towns in England, it has quite a long history.
Tom slid the door shut.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
It is time for kids to go to sleep.
Where are your things?
Tom worked very hard and earned a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom is alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
The first stage is complete.
You will be famous.
He has money enough and to spare.
We're so glad to have you here.
Could I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Please sit down for a moment.
This is Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You are the most boring person I know.
Tom knew that it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm wounded.
Tom stayed with us for several days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked both ways before crossing the road.
Get a picture of this.
Who lives in the house next door?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom'll recover.
For me, it is important.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The tires squealed.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black colours.
It's a piece of cake.
I'm a bit worried now.
Do you have a steady boyfriend?
Tom can still recite a poem he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be watchful.
How would you translate it?
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
Whatever gave you that idea?
What're you talking about?
It was a hard decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope we have fine weather tomorrow.
Mary giggled.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.
Tom does seem familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I resign.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom saved all of the letters Mary sent him.
Take Tom for a swim.
It's safer.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's wardrobe isn't complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
I have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet around here?
Happy Easter!
Tom helped save me a few bucks by telling me about a cheaper place to buy one.
I owe you an apology.
You can't do anything other than admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked all his life.
Die!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
My clock needs to be fixed.
Tom'll live.
Please read between the lines.
You've won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with children.
I will be late.
I ate a hasty lunch.
You can't buy apples any more!
There's a lot of traffic on the freeway.
You should write Tom a note.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom has a family now.
It doesn't surprise me.
He has never come on time that I know of.
Sweet dreams!
Somebody needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you back within twenty minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
Little as we know about her origins, we can at least be sure that she is a pilot of Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom boarded the bus.
Could you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than it is strong.
People used to write books using typewriters.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It is the toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you going back now?
I want to fuck you.
Hopefully, that's not the case.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Carry this.
How barbaric!
What day is tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to getting your letter.
When the cat's away, the mice will play.
We need that from Tom.
Japan is ruled by an emperor and Spain by a king.
This book is Ali's.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the very brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie is drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
All is quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They were laughing at me.
I'm furious.
Take your time, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I don't intend to go to Boston with you this weekend.
He stole a very valuable diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a fish.
This is just like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is this what you want?
I'm glad that you found the money you lost.
Don't exaggerate.
Check that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That's not like you.
He is always here between 5 and 6 o'clock.
Tom was admitted into the hospital.
I hope that I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
Rainy season begins in June.
You're always working.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall appeared to be smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear something?
He has two cars.
Tom will probably still be angry.
He bade us farewell, and went away.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
I look, but I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you replied.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was good and drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who?
How many human beings live on Earth?
I'm a bit worried now.
Come again any time.
We are from Russia.
Bully for you.
What should I do to spare time?
We have to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last donut?
Are you free tonight?
What's it to you if I love you?
You do not speak English.
They shook hands.
They recognized Tom.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.
I am afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom is my oldest brother.
One man has been arrested and charged with the voluntary manslaughter of 25-year-old Mary Tomson.
Come on, you two.
The film was inspired by the novel of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this diamond real?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is self-explanatory.
Tom sees red.
Tom will try to be there on time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does it all mean?
We'll never know the reason.
My favorite teacher was Mr. Jackson.
Tom is bored stiff.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
I have to do what's right.
I love watching you dance.
They substituted coal for oil.
John came to Japan yesterday.
It snowed.
We've already decided not to do that.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
He is a doctor and also a novelist.
It is hers, is it not?
All rights reserved.
I don't live here.
I gave my mother 19 flowers on Mother's Day.
I hope that you like it.
This ticket holds good for a month.
I didn't tell him you're here.
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
I think Tom is pretty angry.
I will contact you as soon as I arrive.
The price turned out to be lower than I thought.
Some regard that spontaneous combastion of human beings occurs, but I am not really convinced.
Who's gonna read such a thick book?
Nice to see you again.
We'll visit you sometime.
I disagree.
You need to focus on your strengths.
You taught us that.
Tom can't come to work today because he doesn't feel well.
I'm a terrible writer.
We could accomplish what we had started before.
They live in a white house with a brick facade on the left at the end of the street.
I'm sure Tom didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
It's too noisy here for me.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting this way?
I'm really upset about it.
Tom is by himself.
If she had been a little more patient, she could have succeeded.
No matter what you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I can't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure that Tom will come to the party.
I'm not certain what time I'm supposed to be there.
Don't open it.
Tom is here already.
I work in a hospital.
I've already told Tom that.

There were many things that we needed to do to prepare for our trip.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I had lunch with him.
I'm tired of arguing.
Very young children don't know many words.
Where was she going?
Mary makes her living by sewing.
Do not drink the water in the dirty glass!
We've won!
Tom ran back inside.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
How does Tom do it?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you sleep enough last night?
Tom asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
The only word written on the page was the word "frog."
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Do you speak Italian?
That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, it's Rick."
I stayed.
Tom ate a piece of the pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.
Don't exaggerate.
Nothing's going my way today.
Really?
This is Brian Rock.
You can do better than that.
Tom is no expert.
We went to see a comedy in London.
Why are you alone?
The corrupt government officials fled the country.
How much blood has the injured lost?
I won't get in your way.
Two boys came running out of the room.
It is never too late to learn.
Please come to my house for a while.
We've got to find them first.
This one's pretty cool.
I have strong reasons to believe that my son Sérgio Melo has registered at Tatoeba today, Sunday, May 11 2014, as member number 20,000.
I think that's absolutely fabulous.
Tom was good and scared.
I speak Bosnian.
Are we nearly there?
Snow is falling.
I didn't recognise the tune.
I'm from Turkey.
Just tell me the truth.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
I wasn't very fluent in French back then.
I spent many evenings curled up in bed in front of the television.
A guard is outside.
Do you have any vacancies?
May I call at around 2:30?
I'm very happy about that.
Well, such things happen.
That's a nice sweater.
I don't really like Tom very much.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom couldn't see anything.
You're stupid.
Tom looked so different after his haircut.
Tom invited Mary to supper.
We're not staying here.
That's curious.
After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.
We walked together as far as the next station.
I have two daughters.
I really didn't have any money.
Tom ducked for cover.
Have courage.
Let's rest for five minutes.
I trust science.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
Keep it simple, Tom.
She smiled.
Just give us a chance.
Be watchful.
Tom walked out on stage.
Tom is getting under my skin.
Have another.
The two men were business partners.
I'm studying now.
I almost forgot my passport.
This house is said to be haunted by spirits.
Will ten thousand yen do?
I'm not used to that.
I still have a few things I need to do.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I can read Chinese fairly well, but I can't write it very well.
I could write Tom a note if you want me to.
Aren't you hot? Why don't you take off your sweater?
I wonder what Tom is up to.
I can't make him happy.
There was a lot to eat.
This watch is less expensive than that one.
Regular use of citrus fruit will shrink pores and make the skin feel fresh.
Eve gave Adam the apple of knowledge.
It seems that most people only barbeque in the summer.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This is not true.
I took the first step.
This is easy.
Your guess is as good as mine.
They're dreadful.
They're only trying to help.
Tom told me that he'd like to become a doctor.
I owe what I am to my father.
Emily is English.
I asked him many questions about ecology.
Why are you still up? You should get to bed.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
We're going on a hike.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you'd already taken care of that.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom has been shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Do good to those who hate you.
I nodded once.
Good day, how are you?
He does not speak English.
Who is your favorite TV star?
Tom's out cold.
How was your day?
He isn't the kind of person who steals.
I'm sure that Tom will come to the party.
We can talk about it in the future.
We won't let you down.
Save your breath.
We don't get many visitors down here.
I like him but he cries into his beer way too often.
She divorced her husband.
Most languages have euphemistic expressions to describe death and dying.
Did you do that purposely?
Don't take the bait.
I wish I could paint like that.
I'm loyal.
Tom likes cheese.
What have you told Tom?
I'm sure this will cause additional problems for you, but it can't be helped.
You need to let go.
What's your job?
Tom hasn't written to me in a long time.
Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
Could you read it?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Hi.
Tom'll manage.
Tom's living proof that you don't have to have brains to be successful.
Tom is a busy fellow.
You look very pale.
This is a good textbook.
I lost my train of thought.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom pulled out some ID.
You're embarrassing her.
My phone is about to die.
Tom persuaded Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch our legs.
I'm going on a trip.
That'll be all for now.
I wonder if he'll come tonight.
The powerless must be protected against the powerful.
I don't know if those languages are related.
I thought you'd be busy.
I want to rent a car, please show me a price list.
How long does a turtle live?
Haven't you done enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom has been trying to impress me.
Here they show up to enjoy themselves by the fountain with ice, beer and picnic basket.
Tom told me not to do that.
We went as far as Boston together.
How long have you been a teacher?
Manufacturers of weapons should contribute to a fund, from which help organisations can extract for their activities in countries where is war.
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We have no such example.
We found the footprints in the sand.
We ran out of the building.
Fine. And you?
There's no free lunch.
Mary is a very individualistic girl.
We cannot allow our emotions to interfere with our actions.
She's my professor.
Tom and I have been close friends for years now.
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Tom knows what he likes.
Tom was very sleepy.
This building will be built in the city.
Come closer.
Come!
What are you reading?
How many phone numbers has she got?
Daddy, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Don't go out tonight.
Don't strain yourself!
Can you wake me up at seven o'clock tomorrow morning?
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
No controversy is ever over for good. It will always resurface at some point.
I eat a lot of meat.
I'm just an average girl.
Work slowly.
I'm a beginner.
This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or yawn.
I'm prepared.
I am against war.
She walks.
It has a nice patina on it.
Tom didn't give it to me.
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
I've tried that already.
You are my mother.
Italy isn't Greece.
I'm just not very happy.
I don't live in this city.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
I'll cooperate.
I hope it does not rain tomorrow.
Give me an example.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Fight!
That's really beautiful.
I've been called worse.
How did I miss that?
I'm not surprised one bit.
I've saved you a seat next to me.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't.
Tom might have something to do with that.
My parents don't like my girlfriend. They say that she's a gold digger.
What's your story?
Where is Laurie?
Were you in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm going to go.
I pissed him off.
That one is very rare.
I looked the other way.
I was trying to be nice.
Could you ask her to call me?
I looked the other way.
Have you seen my dog?
It's gotten dark.
Don't scream.
You know your rights.
You may not enter that room.
That was my point.
The entire town was under water.
I didn't know where it came from.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
What do they call him?
Tom tried the knob.
Could you pass the salt?
I am ashamed of my son having done so.
It was only a partial success.
He always leaves for work at 8:00 a.m.
I'm not a hundred percent sure.
Wanna bet?
Tom didn't like the look of his nose, so he had a nose job.
Beth told Chris to bathe or she will not agree to date him.
I didn't tell her you're here.
Tom bought drinks for everybody.
He described the flight in detail.
Tom knows the Secretary of State.

Stop smoking.
The fuse has blown.
Don't respond.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
Ladies first.
It cannot be difficult; otherwise, women could not do it.
I'm glad people saw it.
She is not ugly.
I'm sick and tired of his lecture.
Nobody would talk to me.
Also Piotr and Lech are good friends.
I didn't tell him you're here.
I have a gun.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
Tom seems very nice.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't all have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He has a good memory.
Tom had a good mentor.
I've returned today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does he make a month?
What a stupid question!
I'm restless.
We demonstrated peacefully.
Mary began to feel hot under the collar.
Stand up and introduce yourself, please.
We are all eager to see the movie.
You have to solve your problems yourself.
Where do you live, Tom?
Satisfied, he smiled.
Tom kept good notes.
That's not a reason to panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom went to his high school reunion last week.
I'll sit down at the table over there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't say a word.
Your book is double the size of mine.
My third husband bought me this.
Your guess is as good as mine.
It sounds like you learned a valuable lesson.
I'm observant.
Let's see.
Tom writes something in his diary every evening, no matter how tired he is.
Were you planning something special?
My parents are dead.
Most scientists believe that this has been caused by man, through the release of methane, of carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases since industrialization. A few other scientists doubt this, however.
Am I being replaced?
Earth is a planet.
I can resist everything except temptation.
It just takes practice.
I paid for it.
Louder, please.
I didn't say I did that.
They know you.
You were right to worry.
I'd like you to look after my dog while I'm out.
I'm baffled.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
How much time do I have left?
Can you explain to me how I can get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen a lot?
You can't rely on Tom.
You kind of look like Tom.
Everything's normal.
You had it coming.
Did you write down the number?
You are under oath.
I fainted.
I wish I had known.
I haven't seen you in here before.
I'm not buying it.
It's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Tom only managed to save a little money.
I'm going to leave work early today.
Do you enjoy the work?
She was wearing a black hat.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
Her composition is very good except for a few errors in spelling.
English is considered an international language.
Don't worry.
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
I am a monk.
I currently live in Boston.
Ania has brown hair, but Magdalena has blonde hair.
What made you decide to quit using Twitter?
I am not a philologist.
Am I a suspect?
I could be of help.
For the love of God!
Haven't you done enough?
All animals are equal.
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I didn't hand out anything.
I have a hunch that it will rain.
Carolina is sad because she cannot conceive.
He has a few friends.
Have you been sleeping?
I don't want meat.
Where are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Tom looks a bit dazed.
I'm really happy about it.
Drive faster.
I try.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's certainly nothing to worry about.
I took off my wig.
My life has been good.
That's my cat.
There are many minor mistakes and tiny misunderstandings here that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I haven't had any complaints so far.
I'm able to ski.
Stay there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the reception.
He is known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
You're lying to me now.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go and look for Tom.
Tom tried his best.
Shoot for the legs!
"Are you serious?" "I'm absolutely serious."
Why are you angry at me?
A morning appointment is better for me.
Tom didn't like the way Mary spoke to him.
We've got to find out.
You're sad.
What's your Bosnian name?
Tom needs to study more if he hopes to pass this class.
I'm tired of arguing.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I can't try it on!
It's too easy that way.
How come?
I won't tell anybody that you did that.
Bears are very dangerous.
Really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought a few books from the bookstore.
Last night, we had to call the police.
I'm worried about you.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
She is the Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come and get me.
I love what you've done with the place.
She decided not to go.
Tom traveled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
It is a fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did do that, didn't I?
Nobody noticed that she was absent until the meeting ended.
She's honest.
Who's chairing the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom was?
You're being irrational.
These are my best friends.
I'm not buying it.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom used to drive a bus.
Would you like a coffee?
In the fall, many birds head for the south.
Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
That article was written in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
You're about to make a very serious mistake.
Do you think Tom is the one who broke the window?
I'm going to leave.
What's this commotion all about?
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
There's a bus stop close to our school.
Don't drink the water.
I'm adopted.
Nobody knows what will happen next.
I've decided.
Do you have a copy?
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
We are going to the cinema.
I can't understand why they're such good friends. They have hardly anything in common.
Dan is a linguist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.
I'm not worried at all.
The bedroom is upstairs.
It's mine, not his.
I could use a hand.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom wasn't able to talk Mary into baking a cake for John's birthday party.
Tom writes very well.
Tom frowned to himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
That's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it by hand.
You sort of hinted that you wanted me to ask you out.
It's recommended that you don't write your passwords down where others might see them.
That's so funny.
Check again.
How could I do that?
Have you eaten anything?
Tom was very supportive.
Silk is expensive.
What are you going to do today?
I'd prefer not to get involved at this stage, thank you.
That only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure whether Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're leaving, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
A taxi is expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I don't know much about Australia.
Tom'll recover.
There's no use trying to persuade him.
It's correct.
Let's be friends.
What are you going to do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The Milky Way is a vast belt of distant stars, each similar to our sun.
Who is that?
I could talk to Tom.
Naoko lives in the white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom did well.
I could go with you.
I'm thrilled.
I called him.
He is a man of wide experience.
The beautiful blonde was sunbathing on the beach.
Logic is obviously your strong point.
We're trying.
Fortunately, Tom did not get seriously hurt.
I want your help.
Stop!
The airline makes sure to send luggage all the way to the final destination as soon as possible, or at a later date, at the passenger's choice.
I've just been too busy.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
What's this all about?
I'd like to kiss you.
He once owned a lot of land.
I pretended that I didn't know what was happening.
Tom laughed at the idea.
She wore suggestive clothing.
I'll be right in there.
He was awfully skinny.
I'm sorry.
What did she look like?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
The Coloseum was used until the year 217, when it was struck by lightning and burnt.
My father is so old that he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It is time for you to go to bed.
You're right on the money.
I regard him as an enemy.
You deserve it.
I'm working.
Does Tom have an attorney?
You changed my life.
Can I use your dictionary?
He ran away from her.
If one has the right to live, then one should also have the right to die. If not, then living is not a right, but an obligation.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
Faith works miracles!
He held his breath.
Tom is a connoisseur.
Congratulations!
The bird on the roof is a crow.
My home is far away.
I've never really been anywhere.
We have our backs to the wall.
I want to check out now.
Check again.
Come with us, please.
Sami is not right in the head.
You don't look very well. Are you sick?
What's the name of that restaurant?
How can I call a taxi?
There are many beautiful parks in London.
Tom became purple with anger.
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
When did you get home?
They know you.
You didn't answer the question.
There are 1,000 English words written down in this vocabulary book, and they all have to be memorized by July.
It's too noisy here for me.
There's a good chance that we'll win.
We've got to get back.
Do you think it's possible to pass all the exams?
It would be different.
Everyone's there.
Is that your car?
Did you bring a hair dryer?
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Were you talking about me?
Tom'll quit.
Does your head hurt?
I can ski.
Why do you think so?
It is snowing today.
You should write Tom a note.
I have a headache today.
She insisted that he should go to the hospital.
I think Tom got a raw deal.
It's not important anymore.
I'm going to correct the homework tomorrow.
Bring help.
Tom suffers from chronic pain.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom had solar panels installed on the roof of his house.
I want you to find out if Tom and Mary are planning to be here by themselves.
He lives in England.
It's scary down here.
Who wants to talk to me?
What a shock!
We tried to stop Tom.
To love and to be loved is the greatest happiness.
Beat it.
I'm guilty.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bring backup.
Bill is my junior by two years.
We just got here today.
Come stay with me.
Bring me her head.
I don't wear suggestive clothing.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different jobs.
You're embarrassing him.
Because of her physical disability Mary now uses a walking stick when she has to go outdoors.
You may as well tell us the truth.
The door of the office is yellow.
I think Tom needs help.
I'm not usually in the office on Mondays.
Daddy, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Lemons contain citric acid.
We'll never catch Tom.
I have many friends.
Croatia was so beautiful.
I demolished the school.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
We'll put a stop to it.
Tom wants his money today.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
Can I use your dictionary?
Is it yours?
You told me that before.
Are you being truthful?
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't have to do that.
Tom is working as a waiter, but he's looking for a better job.
The path is direct.
I need more coffee.
The TV isn't plugged in.
The house was built of bricks.
Everybody lies.
Damn, can you imagine how badly they smelled?
Do you love your mother?
You should get yourself a new car now.
I took the first step.
I'm downstairs.
Be tolerant.
What happens next time?
Do you want fruit juice?
Tom is the best student in our class.
I assumed you were busy.
Go away.
Tom has changed his name.
Can you give us a hand?
I wasn't nervous about it.
Are you going back now?
My name is Hashimoto.
It's comfortable.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You've been spying on me.
It is night. The family is eating dinner.
Better late than never.
We'll never go back there again.
Are we going home?
Even if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
I was off this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is it all resolved now?
Have you seen my dog?
Stay calm.
One day he will be mine.
I have a few friends.
Give Tom a drink.
I'm sick of it!
Although she kept protesting, he went.
I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom could speak French.
I have a sharp pain in the stomach.
You need to lie still.
That was terrible.
Can I exchange this?
They didn't know me.
What a nice looking car!
There are islands in the sea.
Are these bananas ripe?
You're sad.
You're very rude.
I could kill you now.
The soldier kicked Layla awake.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Tell me why you did it.
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning?
Please kick as hard as you can.
I won't let you do that.
I think I can save you some time.
Then I'll see what I can do!
Would you like more tomato juice?
It might not be enough.
Tom liked his job very much.
Have you finished it?
I agreed to buy it.
Can you come?
Yes or no?
Speaking in English is fun.
The postmortem showed that she had been strangled.
Tom'll die.
The pronunciation is as follows:
It was serious.
How was the French class?
Someone must have told him, but it wasn't me.
Oslo is just unique.
No pain, no gain.
Stay positive.
The city was damaged during the war.
I pissed him off.
Give yourself some time.
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you for the information.
What's your marital status?
They needed one another.
Was Tom delusional?
Take your time, but hurry up.
The rumor's all over town.
Time flies.
A Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
A cat is not a person!
I'm good at many things.
I don't like to be surprised.
Come here.
You should eat more vegetables.
The best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more.
It'll be a fun weekend.
What's your name?
Tom'll reconsider.
It hasn't been too cold.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
I hope my mistake will escape his notice.
I bought a cactus.
I'm a bit worried now.
We need the truth now.
The play is over.
Is that a bird?
Does that price include breakfast?
Get Tom to leave.

There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.

Anyway, you're wrong.
Redheads drive me crazy!
I'm not bitter at all.
Man has many wishes that he does not really wish to fulfil, and it would be a misunderstanding to suppose the contrary. He wants them to remain wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfilment would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally, and yearn for death.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
