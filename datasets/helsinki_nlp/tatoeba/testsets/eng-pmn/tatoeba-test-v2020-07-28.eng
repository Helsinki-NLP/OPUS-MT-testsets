Tom is married to a foreigner.
They aren't there.
Tom is busy.
I'll tell them you called.
How are you going to stop them?
I don't want them to take advantage of me.
In the mountain area, snow has fallen more than fifty centimeters deep.
Tom doesn't know Mary is here.
Tom doesn't know what that is.
Did anybody follow you?
I never should've brought you here.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who told him to do that?
She decided to be a doctor.
Tom hasn't written to me in a long time.
You will have to go without her.
Many people shop here.
It was really embarrassing.
Thanks for doing that for us.
Some people never listen.
In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.
Why don't you like Tom?
They bother me.
My name is Jack.
Is this Tom's wife?
You're a strong person.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
They're talking to him.
We're studying now.
I gave him back his ring.
Tom didn't get what he wanted.
Could you please turn the radio on?
They're here to protect him.
Tom doesn't like me much.
Do you study English?
Tom doesn't feel like studying.
I need to work.
Tom wanted us to talk to you.
I bought a book about animals.
I'm sick.
Tom wanted to save the world.
It is still light outside.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
They believed Tom.
Where is the dog?
I love you more than him.
I'm at home.
Tom gave it to us.
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
I believe you.
Take the one you like best, whichever it is.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
I'm sure you're very busy.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Do you speak Italian?
Could you send me more information by email?
Are you going to do that again?
Tom escaped from his cell.
All that glitters is not gold.
Who doesn't like the beach?
They all listened.
It's not my fault.
Take things a little more seriously.
You must be so proud of him.
Where can we meet you?
As a result of the collision, one of the passengers was thrown out.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
Are you sure?
Tom finished doing the dishes.
I'm not frightened of ghosts.
Oh, don't be like that.
They all giggled.
They both coughed.
So what does it mean?
They aren't stupid.
Tom is driving to the hospital.
Lisa speaks not only English but also French.
He's young and healthy.
Could we meet again?
There were few children in the classroom.
I will lend you as much money as you want.
I don't want to go to school.
Tom made three changes.
I love teaching kids Spanish!
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
Is this your bicycle?
Enough!
Tom can't remember his kindergarten teacher's name.
I'm going to miss being a teacher.
I don't blame you.
Can you come?
What was the violation?
Listen to Tom.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but there's something you should see.
What's this?
They all smiled.
This is an easy mistake to make.
It rained hard last night.
Tom doesn't have long to wait.
She carried off all the prizes.
This is what's going to happen.
Everyone has their own opinion.
If you work too long without a rest, it begins to tell on you.
Why didn't you tell him?
Tom's patience has run out.
Tom took everything to his office.
I forgot to shutter the windows before the storm hit.
The cop went through his pockets, but found nothing.
Take a bus.
Don't expose it to the rain.
This is a lesson for me.
The old man stood on the hill.
I know it's impossible.
He died yesterday.
Would you like something to drink?
We need Tom's strength now.
I forgot to tell Tom I wasn't planning to be there.
Hello? Are you still here?
Could you find a room for my sister?
What does Tom eat for lunch?
We are keeping a big dog.
Stand up!
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
I see you reading.
The girls don't like that song.
They all screamed.
We hope Tom sticks around for a couple of weeks.
That's the crux of the matter.
She is younger than me.
Her purse is the same color as her shoes.
They burned themselves.
Try this!
I want to go.
I thought that only I had thought of that.
I have to go to bed.
Where have you gone?
Who did you kill?
Are we doing this?
They called me.
Are you a student?
Are you going to do that again?
She saw the file.
He asked me where to go.
I am thankful for my children.
Open your eyes.
We won the battle.
Tom translated the contract into French.
Tom used to play the piano when he was younger.
There's fresh bread and water here.
You have changed a lot.
Tom is swimming.
They all sat.
I left my shoes at school.
Our victory is secure.
Is my explanation clear?
I don't want 2013 to end.
They're here to protect him.
He showed me how to use this camera.
Can you stay long?
They can help.
How did Tom manage that?
That he would be able to do.
Look out of the window.
I'm working in Tokyo now.
Tom doesn't really mean that, does he?
Tom kind of looks like John.
Maybe it's a good thing Tom isn't here.
He isn't alone anymore.
I refuse to let you marry that man.
I spent all day yesterday with her.
Isn't it scary?
Did you know that?
It's too expensive.
Muiriel is 20 now.
I'll loan you the money you want.
Tom is down.
He does nothing but watch TV all day long.
He proposed that we should start at once.
Tom doesn't have a home.
Tell them it's not your fault.
Tom took some money out of the drawer.
I was out for a walk.
What are you doing?
The bottle is full.
A mother is responsible for the conduct of her children.
Congratulations!
I want to see you smile.
The new bridge is in process of construction.
Their flag is blue and gold.
Now, take a deep breath.
Excuse me.
Tom used to be lazy.
I know it's important work.
Can you get her?
This truck is in need of repair.
What else do you need?
Yaguat√≠ likes swimming in the river.
Tom didn't kill anybody.
He is thought to be difficult to deal with.
He always told me the truth.
Friends do things together.
So what?
We urged Tom to go.
That's a good-looking woman.
Ever since his father died, David is very sad.
I wonder what became of them.
They captured Tom.
Much of what they wrote about never happened.
It is said that nobody has solved the problem yet.
It's phenomenal.
Tom got stuck in a traffic jam.
Sue and John decided to get married.
I have some questions to ask, but I don't want to bother you now.
I have to go to sleep.
Which group is your friend in?
You gave up.
Tom certainly was polite.
I think you know what we have to do.
The answer was right in front of me.
Are you married?
I don't have any cash on me.
He was asking about your health.
Tom got here late.
Good morning!
Tom wished he was with Mary.
If anything happens, we'll be in in three seconds.
She is a well-known singer.
It's too expensive!
Thanks for the opportunity.
India's Independence Day is celebrated on the fifteenth of August.
This is your bag, isn't it?
Spring has come early this year compared with last year.
I told them they didn't have to do anything.
Tom will never do that.
Are you looking for somebody?
I want a knife with which to cut the rope.
Where are you from?
What do you want me to do?
You will be ignored.
Let me explain.
I'm going to miss being a teacher.
They fixed it.
You're still young.
I'm thirsty.
They all stopped.
They both smiled.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom is the only person who can help me now.
Answer the question.
Don't tell my wife.
Life begins at forty.
You're in better shape than I am.
Nothing is impossible.
Who are you talking about?
It's just a fantasy.
He fell victim to his own ambition.
I'll make you happy.
John is a veterinarian.
I've never drank milk with tea.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
This is Mary's dog.
We have not seen each other since our school days.
I thought Tom was supposed to be in Boston. What's he doing here?
Thank you for your opinion.
I am thankful for my children.

Solitude is the school of wisdom.
I don't know if I have the time.
He doesn't listen to his teachers.
I saw Joe last Sunday.
I hope you'll find what I'm searching for.
She was educated by her grandfather.
The old man stood on the hill.
Tom had never seen Mary so happy.
This is a big mistake.
I told Tom everything I could think of.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
What is your last name?
What should you do if you are bitten by a cobra?
The pain never went away.
Do you eat meat?
Tom thinks that I was in Boston last week.
You're paying.
She saw the file.
I will have him call you the moment he gets back.
I think Tom did the best he could.
I always go to the beach.
I just want you to know that Tom is safe.
If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.
Don't cut your hair!
I don't think my gift meant very much to Tom.
I have no idea where Tom hid the money.
Where is your father?
Hurry up, or we'll be late.
What did you call me in here for?
Do I have to do it now?
Tom used to go fishing with his father.
He is a teacher apart from the rest.
The more people you know, the less time you have to see them.
I've heard this song before.
They entered cautiously.
I don't know what I know.
You will do no such thing.
It looks like Tom isn't interested in that.
They already know.
Tom was blinded.
The city was destroyed by fire.
Do you drink?
Do you like apples?
Tom came over to my house last night.
Nobody likes bad news.
Where are you going to?
He is a man of profound knowledge.
I couldn't do this without your help.
He was arrested because he stole the money.
Why don't you want to come with us?
You don't know a thing about me.
It's a dictionary.
I want that cat.
We sometimes make mistakes.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
As he was about to leave, he said goodbye.
How do you plan on paying for that?
Some of them are too much to bear.
They continued walking.
They buried it.
Don't worry. It won't take very long.
Are you tired?
I'm at a loss for words.
What did we do to each other?
I am very tired.
Let's go!
They can't escape.
They found nothing.
Tom should've asked Mary for help.
I spent all day yesterday with him.
My little sister is scared of all doctors.
They aren't twins.
Is your mom home?
Come along with us.
She could feel her knees shaking.
The mob gathered round the car like so many flies.
What a lazy teacher!
Help!
Vegemite is a popular Australian foodstuff.
The English entered into the tea trade at that time.
I was in the mountains.
Nobody knows that I have bought a new car.
He went out of the room without being noticed by anyone.
He proposed that we should start at once.
He has nobody to consult.
In this game, players were not allowed to kick the ball.
I didn't even know that you used to live in Boston.
The wind died down by the evening.
Tom has a moustache.
They continued searching.
Is there a McDonald's near here?
Did you say anything to him?
Is that all you're going to tell me?
Tom jumped out of the helicopter.
How many times have you gone?
The city was destroyed by fire.
Everyone likes him.
He loves fishing.
Should I call the doctor?
Everybody got scared.
I want some food.
Don't forget about us!
It is not safe for a girl to go out by herself so late at night.
Did you see something?
I have been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
Don't tell him.
I don't remember where I put my car keys.
I can't see my dad.
I didn't ask them any questions.
They continued working.
Please iron the shirt.
I have to wake Tom up soon.
Maybe you'd better call him.
Did you get Tom's message?
You go first.
I remember it all.
Do you live here?
Are your parents going to be home?
Nothing is as precious as love.
No one here pays.
You are my friend.
I got to know my current girlfriend at the gym.
Don't worry.
They came in.
I'll go and ask Tom.
They gave up.
It's too large.
I just want to hug you.
Tom certainly is knowledgeable.
He plays very well.
She must be angry.
He thinks that he's the centre of the universe.
Aren't you going to dance?
Do you drink coffee?
I need you.
This isn't my fault, is it?
Can you think of anyone more suitable?
It doesn't surprise me.
The monkey escaped from its cage.
Did I say I was finished?
They believe you.
You're probably right, Tom.
Should I ask them?
How many moons does Mars have?
Do your best and don't worry.
It was Tom who told me what had happened.
He proposed that we should start at once.
I have a brand new pair of socks.
The clock is defective.
He said I don't get enough sleep.
I'm at home.
Everybody got scared.
Tom never goes to places like that.
I exercise because I want to stay healthy.
We arrived at the station at five.
Tom and Mary didn't invite me to their wedding.
During the battle, it was as if time had stopped.
How could she have known?
Almost all of us can speak French.
I believe you.
Tom had something in his hand.
Tell Tom Mary's on the way.
He failed the entrance exam.
I have a fear of the dark.
We don't want her to leave.
Can we talk about this later?
John sent me a letter written in German.
How are you?
They work at night.
Did you know Tom was seeing someone else?
He was set free after doing five years in prison.
Tom may be back.
We can't go right now.
We will begin the meeting when Bob comes.
We didn't talk yesterday.
Everyone likes him.
Please close the door.
There are 50 members in the club.
He proposed that we should start at once.
Is it a recent picture?
Nobody called him.
We have to help her.
We have pictures.
It's not that big of a deal.
Do you love me?
I'm as old as you.
They drove home.
He kissed me and then I slapped him.
Leave me alone!
They want to know what's happening.
They all talked.
Me, too.
Thanks for the inspiration.
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while.
Does anybody know him?
It's no longer that way.
We heard them.
I think Tom died.
I know you are rich.
Mary's neighbor is a busybody.
Tom might not make it in time.
You all remember Tom, don't you?
They aren't here.
Broccoli is one of the best vegetables for you.
A baby craves its mother's milk.
The public is requested not to litter in these woods.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
Have you ever had your fortune told?
Tom was at the gym for three hours yesterday.
Tom drank too much.
I am connecting this computer to the Internet.
We're finding it difficult deciding on which one to buy.
He called a taxi for me.
If Jason should call me, tell him I'm not in.
I didn't know you were from Boston, too.
We were retreating.
I don't think we'll reach Boston before dark.
Excuse me.
Can you drive a car?
Tom won't be that easy to convince.
I am happy.
You must be so proud of him.
I was disappointed in you.
This is what's going to happen.
I drink alcohol.
The young girl is singing.
Do you know the answer?
Tom and I are the only ones still here.
I can speak many African languages.
Thanks for the advice, Tom.
Every apple is red.
I didn't like what Tom gave me.
Use this.
I wish I was in Boston.
Do you have any problems with that?
What do you want?
Tom is watching TV now.
They believe you.
This isn't your fault, Tom.
What do I tell her?
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Mary probably knows I like her.
They caught Tom.
This is Mary's dog.
You're the one who brought me here.
The Pacific is the largest ocean in the world.
That doesn't seem right.
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox?
Now we don't know what to do.
We reported his disappearance.
He came late, as is often the case with him.
Who's free?
The earth is a ball.
They are more active at night.
I'm going to miss being a teacher.
If you're looking for a job, call me.
The password is "Muiriel".
Tom got a bargain price.
We don't know just yet.
He named his son James.
Few people have two cars.
We've been wondering where you've been.
Thank you for your support.
A new idea came to me.
You'll soon get used to eating Japanese food.
It's not only Tom that has to study. I have to study, too.
You know her, I think.
Stay with Tom for a moment.
She is a well-known singer.
Really?
Why are you crossing the street?
Good evening.
They came back.
Tom doesn't appear to hear us.
It's raining.
Tom drank milk.
It's a piece of cake.
Do all of you speak French?
Whose bag is this?
Let's go meet them.
I'll be watching you.
So far he has admitted nothing.
Stay with Tom in this room.
He doesn't listen to his teachers.
Tom is a gentleman.
He's three years older than I am.
Tom seems discontented.
"Tom's crying." "I know."
The matter was settled.
I'll make it simple.
Tom is getting ready to go to work.
Your watch seems to be very valuable.
We have a son.
The worst is still to come.
I came to Boston last month.
It's Tom's decision.
There's something you should see.
They all watched.
This'll only take a minute.
As a whole, the plan seems to be good.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
You won't believe this!
The leaves change color in autumn.
The bathroom's on the left.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Don't worry!
I couldn't sleep well last night.
Mary thinks I'm in love with her.
Everyone is anxious to know what has become of the former champion.
They both giggled.
Tom has green eyes.
Green leaves are coming out little by little.
I need a cup of hot coffee.
One language is never enough.
You can tear the box open.
I was a teacher.
You can do it.
I spoke with my family.
Your watch seems to be very valuable.
Can you talk to him?
You must be so proud of her.
Don't give up your day job.
Thank you!
They drank coffee.
Fancy to eat at my place?
Take it off.
The children ran toward the classroom.
I'm at home.
I've never had a beer in the middle of the day before.
I think you should help her.
Tom didn't go to the hospital.
We listen to music.
They're talking to her.
I walk twenty miles a day.
Would it be possible to replace a man's tooth with one from an animal?
We've been married more than thirty years.
Armenia is a mountainous country.
I lived in Boston for about three years.
Call the police!
Tom waited in front of the house.
I could scarcely believe it.
Tom's dirty clothes are on the floor.
I'm gonna shoot him.
She woke up naked on the floor.
Meg is excited.
The public is requested not to litter in these woods.
I won't do it again.
The window was wide open.
Did you lose something?
I didn't know Tom lived in Boston.
Tom and I'll both be there.
Tom didn't want to live any longer.
They will change it.
I didn't trust her at first.
It cannot be true.
He doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why.
He is not kind to her.
I bought this book in Boston last month.
Would you come our house?
How many more pages do you have left to read?
Tom should be home by 2:30.
They all know.
She shut herself up in her room.
They found nothing.
Don't you hear that?
We were prisoners.
At last came the spring, with its warm sunshine.
Do you know her?
What got into you?
I don't know.
We'll tell Tom everything he needs to know.
They all stood.
She quickly went up the stairs.
I hear he was released after five years in prison.
We corrected it.
The Martians have conquered the earth.
Summer is almost over.
Keep her away from us.
It was a gift.
Let's look in the closet.
This is the word which I would like to replace.
Tom wanted to save the world.
They might be able to help you.
Do I have to pay you?
They aren't rich.
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
I'll wait for you.
I've got her with me.
I think it's possible that he may come.
Who are you talking about?
What did Tom say about what happened?
Tom's not a bad kid.
Tom wanted to stick around for a few more days.
Tom is voting.
Why did you quit using Twitter?
Show her what you're capable of.
You can drive, can't you?
Thanks for the support.
Are you hungry?
Tom moved the flower pot to the left and the secret door slid open.
You have thirty minutes left.
Let's discuss that problem tomorrow.
He laid his bag on the table.
Learn to write.
Today is Independence Day.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
We have made friends with Tom.
You are ill.
It's a waste of time.
I was a teacher.
When do you usually eat lunch?
I clean up my room every Sunday.
You can't possibly win.
Let me go my own way.
I'll tell her you came by.
Tom was about to get into his car when he was shot.
They found us.
Must I clean the room?
He will arrive on the afternoon of the 5th.
How to say it?
This is kind of fun.
Do you think Tom knows how to get there?
You are always complaining.
What kind of mushrooms are they?
I ate too much.
He is a mere child.
Can you see the woman standing behind Tom? That's Mary.
She doesn't listen to her parents.
We know her.
She treated him for a broken leg.
She has psychic abilities.
May I have your email, please?
She is cold to me.
The jets took off one after another.
Take a look at that.
I didn't want to appear hypocritical.
Tom didn't look like a doctor.
Tom finished his coffee and left for work.
Is this possible?
She has a flower in her hand.
I pushed Tom into the water.
If Tom is really alive, where is he?
The sickness has weakened your organism.
Tom knows what this means.
She has lost her umbrella.
Can you get her?
Go away.
I wish I'd never told Tom that.
Tom is busy.
Who's in command?
I always have an uncomfortable feeling.
Tom and I are both nervous.
I don't know.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
Tom drove along a desert road.
Do you remember me?
Do we have to pay anything?
I don't like it either.
The Kamo runs through Kyoto.
Tom peeked out the door to see what was happening.
Is your watch correct?
I love a woman.
Do you want to do this or not?
I want you to follow me.
He earns three times as much as I do.
I had some calls to make.
I'll be with you in ten minutes.
Tom can barely speak.
Tom obviously feels very passionate about this.
What happened in Vietnam was like a bad dream.
I put it back.
Where is the bathroom?
This discovery will be recorded in history.
He caught the cord.
It is very important to keep your word.
Tom is still at school.
John sent me a letter written in German.
Excepting Sundays he works every day.
A question is an answer.
I like candy.
I am sewing my shirt.
Tom did an incredible job.
I asked for grape juice.
I'll write to Tom.
Tom took his headphones off.
I translate into Esperanto for free.
I'm proud of you.
This isn't my fault, is it?
Where do you think all the money goes?
That boy over there looks about the same age as you.
Make sure you tell him that.
You're too big.
I haven't found anything yet.
Watch them closely.
He loves fishing.
Tom has a wife and three kids.
We lost it.
It is too risky.
We had Tom paint the wall.
I hope it'll be quiet.
It was his fault.
He said, "Leave me alone."
Who's free?
This dog is mine.
He doesn't have a sister.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
Tom had a company to run.
Perhaps you should get one.
Tom wasn't listening to Mary.
Tom got some money from his father.
What did you do to each other?
I didn't like it.
How many people are on board the ship?
What kind of man was he?
They didn't run.
According to you.
That's just how I was raised.
Do you want me to call Tom?
It was a lie.
I wish school would disappear forever!
We close at 2:30.
Tom and I had an agreement.
The train was almost empty.
They exchanged smiles.
Tom must be winning.
I don't have any money.
I want to buy a dozen doughnuts.
It's not going to happen to Tom.
Please excuse my being late.
I asked Tom to call you.
Does anybody have a problem with this?
They exchanged gifts.
That was unrealistic.
My parents still haven't met my girlfriend.
Shit stinks.
This is what'll happen.
I thought you were serious.
They'll find Tom.
Did I write that?
In a store if you break something you must pay for it.
What is it?
Is that edible?
Is it safe now?
I have to get home before it gets dark.
For whom will you vote for president?
Do you live here?
Show him what you're capable of.
I'm tired of living this kind of life.
This car runs on alcohol.
There's nothing I can do about it.
I don't know where we'll arrive.
He has left now.
The driver was so fortunate as to escape death.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
We have plans.
I want to talk with Tom.
Which would you prefer, coffee or tea?
My parents were proud of me.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
She wept when she heard the terrible news.
That car is really expensive.
What good is beauty?
They stopped talking.
Didn't you see Tom at the party?
I want you to turn off the radio.
He is to come here at five.
I might be able to help her.
Would you like something to drink?
I like milk more than juice.
They arrested him.
Do you like tea?
There was a lot of students absent from class today.
That's enough.
Why do you stay with them?
More than half of the residents are opposed to the plan.
What are you looking for?
For whom will you vote for president?
She is a famous singer.
Maybe they'll come for you.
What street is this?
Do you speak English?
Goodnight!
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox?
I saw him just now.
Let's not go.
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission.
I can't stand your behaviour any more.
Didn't you know that she passed away about two years ago?
I am more beautiful than you.
The children ran toward the classroom.
Please excuse my being late.
Tom eats too fast.
Tom is drinking water.
There are islands in the sea.
Translating this poem is too much for me.
Should that happen, what will you do?
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
They made me go there.
Where do you think all the money goes?
I promise not to tell them.
My mother thinks of everything in terms of money.
Now you do it.
I can't authorize that.
He plays the piano very well.
They all knew.
You look stupid.
I'm here because of her.
Rambo doesn't exist.
The boy was accompanied by his parents.
It's not going to happen to Tom.
We kissed each other.
I talked to her on the phone.
To translate is to betray.
That's my dog.
They all walked.
Maybe I could go with you.
Don't handle my books with dirty hands.
First, let us talk about the experiments conducted in laboratories.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I, too, like candy.
Thanks for the advice, Tom.
Tom won that contest.
Few people seem to have read the book.
The concert will take place next Sunday.
Stand up!
We have been in Paris.
Those are the children you gave the book to.
We had Tom paint the wall.
They both screamed.
Tom is selling his sheep.
What do you like about it?
I watched the birds on the balcony while drinking my coffee.
How come you know so much about Japanese history?
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
I don't want to go to school.
I've been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom took everything to his office.
He came over and cooked dinner for me.
We'll get another one.
I study Korean.
Tom is in recovery.
They appear dead.
I want you to get started right away.
May I borrow your dictionary?
The bird is in the sky.
What's your son's name?
The entire nation was glad at the news.
She decided to be a doctor.
Happy New Year!
Isn't it remarkable?
Do we know you?
Tom has come to a decision.
Do you think I'd look good with a mustache?
Tom doesn't know the truth.
We are doing something.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
You should report this to the police.
He made no response.
Like father, like son.
What became of him?
My father came back from Osaka last week.
This plant has some burned leaves.
It was her fault.
Tom is watching TV now.
She's mine.
Trousers of today sit much lower on the waist than they did centuries ago.
Can't you go by yourself?
I will tell it to him at the proper time.
Tom told me to give this to Mary.
They came together.
Where can we meet you?
Just imagine: he is a doctor, and yet he is a smoker.
We have made friends with Tom.
We didn't talk yesterday.
What would you like to eat?
I'm not chicken.
He doesn't listen to his parents.
Can you predict the future?
You never said anything.
I do not know.
Tom doesn't have to be at today's meeting.
I'm not a doctor.
Let me explain.
Please excuse my being late.
That was an evil bunny.
They arrested him.
All the passengers were killed in the airplane crash.
You have told Tom the truth, haven't you?
What's your last name?
I'd like to meet with her.
They aren't dead.
That was the scary part.
Tom worked until late at night.
Don't ask.
We're concerned about Tom's future.
I'm leaving early next week.
How will you manage without a job?
Yes.
How could he have known?
He graduated from high school this spring.
I didn't trust him at first.
I've missed something.
I don't know.
I do not know.
A new idea came to me.
I would like to buy some aspirin.
Why isn't Tom doing something?
Do you know much about that?
My room has two windows.
They finally left.
Tom visited Boston last year.
The children's laughs spread throughout the forest.
Don't get lost.
She has quite a lot of clothes.
We're flying above the clouds.
There are as many museums as there are churches.
They looked down on him.
They found Tom.
Tom and I are both nervous.
I'll certainly talk to Tom.
I think Tom did this.
I'm not sure if Tom saw it.
They are more active at night.
What do you think I was doing?
I don't understand.
Are you ready?
Tom didn't even text Mary to tell her he'd be late.
They all drank.
Rats don't have nephews.
The city wants to extend the road.
Naomi has just finished her work.
Have you seen Tom's passport?
I want Tom to read this.
I'll give it to you.
How many hotels do you think there are in Boston?
Your mom is here.
How are you?
It could rain tonight.
It's big!
We're concerned about Tom's future.
I made that for you.
What's in these boxes?
Do we need a Plan B?
I didn't know Tom didn't understand French.
It looks like Tom was right.
He failed the entrance exam.
Where are you?
Termites are destroying the houses.
The store might be closed already.
I am entirely at your service.
His wife was killed in the accident.
They finished eating.
He's young and healthy.
I tried to get them to stop.
He refused to shake hands with me.
Tom probably won't even notice that Mary isn't here.
They executed Tom.
Nobody called you.
No one's going to see us.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
Tom may have been there. I don't know.
Tom is clueless.
I love you.
They don't help.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his children.
They caught me.
I don't even know what Tom's last name is.
I am connecting this computer to the Internet.
I can hide everywhere.
We have plans.
The city wants to extend the road.
She goes to the movies once a week.
This is very difficult for him.
Tom laid the racket on the ground.
I don't think Tom has met Mary yet.
What he says is very true.
He will get back from school.
We reported his disappearance.
I have a lot of credit cards.
Do you have a student fare?
We looked down at the beautiful sea.
Workers lost their jobs.
This is the next one!
What should we do during our next vacation?
They both work.
There are no flowers growing on Mars.
What's your last name?
Don't forget the ticket.
He wrote three books in as many years.
You're going to tell us everything.
I know Tom isn't guilty.
I have two cats.
No one respected men like him.
When Tom drinks, everybody drinks.
I am free of debt.
What is your name?
We went to New York by plane.
This is the order.
There's something true in what he says.
Tom is connecting his phone to the Internet.
Why don't we order pizza?
Tom doesn't know how to treat his employees properly.
It's time for the truth.
They'll ask her.
They all rose.
Why don't you both give up?
They found this.
I traveled to Italy last summer.
You'll go to school tomorrow.
I did it on purpose.
I need to buy some rat poison.
You must be so proud of her.
A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert.
Just get back.
What does Tom eat for a mid-afternoon snack?
Hide that book.
Horses are animals.
I was in the mountains.
This movie is really scary.
I'm taking notes.
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
I like candy, too.
Are you ready to go?
I think I've found a meteorite.
They went to an expensive restaurant for lunch.
In a word, it's ridiculous.
Get dressed quickly.
How do you translate "Pfirsichbaeumchen" into Berber?
It only happened once.
Something is better than nothing.
It was her fault.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Tom couldn't suppress his anger.
What became of her?
He left the room without so much as saying good-bye to me.
They didn't answer.
You won't believe this!
He put some coins in the box.
Did you hear about Tom and Mary?
She carried off all the prizes.
Why do you allow Mary to do this to you?
I can't live without you.
Have you seen this already?
Do you like to travel?
I had never been there before.
I'll tell her you came by.
That's what I've ordered.
My mother doesn't like the heat of summer.
They already left.
Can I help you?
You've told me that before.
I'm falling.
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.
There are a million people in Auckland.
They found us.
Somebody is eating.
My goal is to become a doctor.
Nobody seems to be in charge.
Let's do it!
There are four seasons in a year - spring, summer, fall, and winter.
This was left on the porch.
We really do want to help them.
He is good at handball.
Quick, hold onto this tree.
Are you free tomorrow?
Congratulations!
Would you like another helping of potatoes?
We have a lot to celebrate.
Have they given you a nickname yet?
They have a kid.
Can you wait about an hour?
The shop carried leather goods.
They followed you.
She was like a second mother to me.
Tom wept.
How are you coming along with your French lessons?
I don't know if I have the time.
He gets up at seven.
I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.
Lisa speaks not only English but also French.
I traveled to Italy last summer.
Their flag is blue and gold.
I can't do this anymore.
Make sure you tell her that.
We have a kid.
Where are you going?
She will return within an hour.
I need to have a haircut.
Tom used to be lazy.
I live here.
Give me a ride home.
Eternal love doesn't exist.
They don't understand.
How old are you?
She is a well-known singer.
They both died.
They don't listen.
I'll call you back later.
This discovery will be recorded in history.
Tom is a little taller than me.
The public is requested not to litter in these woods.
Merry Christmas!
That's the message.
My boss called me into his office.
What's going to happen that's so terrible?
I'm not talking about that.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
Tom and Mary split up after their son died.
Who told her to do that?
I've had enough.
It was freezing.
I wanted to see them.
She was scared to cross the road.
Hurry up.
You can mix different foods in a blender.
You wouldn't lie.
I really like him, but not his circle of friends.
We have been in Paris.
Tom and I used to play tennis together.
Trousers of today sit much lower on the waist than they did centuries ago.
I came here to play soccer.
I know it's important to you.
Suddenly, it began to rain.
We always play tennis on Saturday morning.
An old woman limped along the street.
They're waiting for it.
I'll give it to Tom.
I make lunch every day.
My mother thinks of everything in terms of money.
That's what everyone says.
Can we really afford that?
The whole plan is only based on his personal opinions.
This is Mary's dog.
We made use of the maps during our journey.
She cut down a tree.
I'm ready for a vacation.
They arrested Tom.
Please explain the rules of soccer to me.
He was blind from birth.
I have a headache.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
They all died.
They followed Tom.
Do you have to rent a car?
Muiriel is 20 now.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Some kinds of food make us thirsty.
I didn't know anything about this.
He can speak not only English but also German.
They all entered.
I've been wrong.
We'll be waiting.
Bob has the habit of going to bed at 10:00.
It looked funny.
What time did you shut the shop?
All the soldiers were gallant.
He won't listen to me.
What did you do to each other?
Tom is allowed to do that.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I've found something amazing!
They decided to settle in a suburb of London.
Where do you live?
It was his fault.
There's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox?
This is important to them.
Maybe we can talk to her.
I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept.
Ask him.
Tom came in and handed Mary an envelope.
Would you like something to drink?
I can't fix the seat.
They all left.
We shall do this free of charge.
They believe it.
I'll tell you everything.
I was in bed all day long yesterday.
This is never going to end.
Tom is deaf in one ear.
Do you live here?
You will pay for it.
Are you at home, too?
Thank you very much!
Do you think I'm crazy?
Tom turned off the music.
I pointed this out to her.
Don't let him keep this picture.
We urged Tom to go.
Do whatever's required.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
I'm old, but I'm not that old.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table.
Take the medicine.
Show me what you're capable of.
It's a waste of time and money.
May I borrow your dictionary?
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help.
Tom is talking with someone right now. Can you wait?
Tell me again who will be helping us.
The cook broiled the meat.
Both of my kids have already graduated from high school.
Are you hungry?
How are you going to stop them?
Tom didn't buy me what I needed.
Have you ever seen one of these before?
Our captain got sick, so I attended the meeting in his place.
They don't care.
Where are you from?
I think we've eaten enough.
How do I get to the other side?
Tom doesn't even know my name.
The babies are screaming.
I think we should help them.
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here.
I always go to the beach.
Come here. I want to show you something.
A glass of water, please.
Tom went to Boston three years ago.
The government was earning more money than it needed.
How did Tom solve the problem?
What is your last name?
Why don't you just let Tom help?
They all looked.
Come in, it's open.
My car ran out of gas.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Good morning!
I am off duty tomorrow.
Where does Tom live?
I have no time.
Tom waited for Mary to come back.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Tom moved the flower pot to the left and the secret door slid open.
He plays very well.
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.
I cannot walk without a stick.
They all gasped.
I am interested in books.
You're the tallest person here.
They arrested her.
She bought some meat and eggs so that she might make omelets.
I always forget that I already logged in.
Are you mad?
My prayers were answered.
They need to talk.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
She got him to eat his vegetables.
He is not a physician.
Who are you waiting for?
I eat using a utensil.
If it had not been for civil war, they would be wealthy now.
In a word, life is short.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Can you get this trash out of here?
I was home all day yesterday.
Tom is connecting his phone to the Internet.
They can change.
Do write to me soon!
Let's do it.
Is my explanation clear?
She treats me as if I were a stranger.
The book is on the table.
What is your name?
Thanks for the support.
The bridge is high.
It wasn't you, was it?
I have to find out when Tom plans to leave.
Fresh vegetables are very dear in winter.
I won't let anything bad happen.
Is it yours?
I'm about to get married!
Who turned off the light?
I just don't know what to say.
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Not until late at night did he come home.
This is a horse.
Where did I put it?
Nobody understands me.
Do you speak Chinese?
Oh, I do wish I could go to France.
He was happy being a Jew.
We can solve this.
The city wants to extend the road.
Natto is sticky.
I have no home to live in.
We corrected it.
We disputed for hours about what to write.
Yesterday was my birthday.
I was a teacher.
Where is your school?
They bought it.
We were prisoners.
I also like candy.
He is eager for success.
Where is the toilet?
My room is always clean.
Tom went into a corner and cried.
Spaghetti don't grow on trees.
Here's one I forgot.
They can wait.
Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
Tom lives on a farm in California.
Let me walk you to your car.
I'll be waiting.
She doesn't look like her mom.
Where is my dog?
We can't see it.
Happy birthday, Muiriel!
We can't pretend it never happened.
Shut up!
Tom accepted Mary's offer.
Tom doesn't eat a lot of meat.
I wish I'd never told Tom that.
Do you think Tom knows?
Tom looks angry.
Should we wait for you?
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old.
We haven't tried that yet.
He doesn't listen to his teachers.
I'll try to explain it to the best of my ability.
Please write down what I'm about to say.
This is my life's ambition.
Why would that be?
Do you think it's safe to do that?
I don't want them to take advantage of me.
I am selling my goats.
You are very brave.
I have a friend who lives in Sapporo.
I know it's impossible.
Tom doesn't seem tired at all.
I knew I'd seen it before.
Tom didn't recognize her.
Doctors did everything they could to cure him.
What's in these boxes?
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
I've got to do this now.
I thought you had taken everything out of the office.
We'll have a French test on Monday.
He never visited her.
They continued eating.
They stayed one more day together.
I have plans with Tom tonight.
The bottle is full.
Tom didn't show up for dinner.
My foot fell asleep.
Shall we go?
Tom went back to his seat.
Get lost!
I said leave Tom alone.
The bridge is low.
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox?
He said he could do it.
We sometimes make mistakes.
What happened to Tom's parents?
I exercise because I want to stay healthy.
I didn't know that you used to live in Boston.
I was up all night reading.
He's not the same man he used to be.
Did you get Tom's message?
Our victory is secure.
These are my shoes and those are yours.
He was asking about your health.
This house has a solid foundation.
Let's open it.
My sister has three times as many books as I do.
Tom wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I don't have a cat.
Should I tell Tom you're unavailable?
What have you taken?
We can solve this.
Next time you come to see me, I will show you the book.
I'd like to ask you about Tom.
The river is widest at this point.
The news made him happy.
What he said surprised me.
I'll loan you the money you want.
Watch them closely.
I bought the book which the children need.
Is your watch correct?
He comes here every five days.
What are you shaking your head for?
You're stronger today.
Don't you want to see your kids?
They found Tom.
Tom almost never asks about that.
Tom is out of the office.
Of course!
They usually sleep in this room.
There were no laws for people to abide by.
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history?
Do you believe in God?
I have to study for the exam.
How many close friends do you have?
Tom has something he wants to say.
Burn not your house to fright the mouse away.
Thank you.
Do you speak Japanese?
I neither drink nor smoke.
Tom knows time is running out.
We reported his disappearance.
I want to drink it.
The mistake hastened his retirement.
Let's go!
The bottle is empty.
Each room is equipped with large desks.
I know your father.
We're going to be late for the concert.
She closes the door.
Did Tom go home?
It is said that she is a good cook.
I will be back soon.
Didn't you see Tom at the party?
Let's get it open.
John is a veterinarian.
They already knew.
All my friends like you.
You won't find a dog bigger than this one.
I've never flown before.
When he arrived, I made coffee.
That's true, isn't it?
I cannot afford to buy a car.
Can we stop it?
Tom may be hurt.
We're looking for Tom now.
I read a lot.
You will have to go without her.
This is my Japanese friend.
How do you say that in Italian?
