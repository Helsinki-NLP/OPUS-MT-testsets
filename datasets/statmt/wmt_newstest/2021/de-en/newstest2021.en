I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in space.
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
This was one of the groups.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You would literally hear the sound.
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
That song has been ringing through space for all that time.
We weren't even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Biker reacts lighting-fast and prevents the worst
On Friday evening, there was a traffic accident on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, where the motorcyclist only suffered minor injuries thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver doesn’t see biker
A 44-year old car driver coming from Merklingen wanted to make a left turn onto country road 1230 towards Machtolsheim around 9:30 p.m. in her VW.
She did not see the 24-year old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen who had the right of way.
During the collision, the hand brake and foot brake lever flew off
The biker tried to evade the car, but still hit the rear of the vehicle.
Grazing the car caused the Suzuki’s hand and foot brake levers to be torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Alert, he steered his motorcycle into the median strip next to the roadway and let the motorcycle coast to a stop there.
Biker suffers leg injury
The biker did suffer a leg injury from the impact with the car and had to be treated at a hospital.
Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse.
A traffic accident occurred on Friday evening on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen where a bike rider was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
A female car driver overlooks a biker
Around 21:30 a 44 year old female car driver, coming from Merklingen with her VW, wanted to turn left into the country road 1230 into the direction of Machtolsheim.
At this, she overlooked the 24 year old motorbike driver with right-of way who came from the direction of Nellingen.
When they collided hand and foot brake pedals break off
The biker still attempted to evade the car, however, brushed against the car at the rear end.
Thrush the brushing against the car hand break handle and foot break pedal were ripped off the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to break.
Alerted he steered his bike into the grass strip beside the road and taxied it to a standstill without losing control.
Biker suffers leg injuries
Through the collision with the car the biker suffered, however, an injury on his leg and had to be treated in a hospital.
Mamming: Coronavirus mass infections: 174 farmhands infected
Following a coronavirus mass infection in a large vegetable farm in Mamming in lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and not allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the confinement.
A total of 174 farmhands tested positive for the coronavirus pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during mass testing, as the district office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
“To prevent further spread, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population,” stated district administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees were previously infected on the farm - this was the reason for the mass testing.
The business is a large vegetable farm, which cultivates raspberries, cucumbers, cabbages and beets - but the cucumbers are only for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with approximately 3,300 residents, not far from Dingolfing’s large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to stay calm: “According to our information, this is a closed group of people.”
On the farm, infected employees were kept separated from non-infected employees, and the premises are now surrounded by a fence.
The Green and SPD parties blamed the state government.
The two opposing factions accused Minister-President Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of failing to control the seasonal workers’ accommodation.
“This could pay dearly if local infections like this spread and regional lockdowns have to be arranged,” said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Green Party.
The SPD sees it very similarly: “After the coronavirus outbreak in the Wiesenhof butchery in mid-May, we called for a special control program, including for farms with seasonal workers,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“The hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions need to be heavily controlled, in our opinion.
Obviously this didn’t happen.”
The outbreak happened “on cue.”
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people have been quarantined and are not allowed anymore to leave the operations.
A security service monitors the curfew.
Altogether 174 harvesters were tested positive for the Corona virus Sars-CoV-2 at a mass screening as the district administration Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
“In order to avoid a further spreading we unfortunately must take this measure to protect the population”, county commissioner Werner Bumeder (CSU) explained.
Before that already seven coworkers had been infected on this farm - this triggered the mass screening.
The operations concern a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - however the cucumbers only for canning jars.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 residents not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder called on the citizens to keep calm: “According to our information it concerns a closed group of persons.”
On the farm infected coworkers were separated from non-infected ones, the premises are now fenced in with a construction fence.
Greens and SPD blamed the State government for shared responsibility.
Both opposition parties accused prime minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect monitoring the housing for seasonal workers.
“That can backfire horribly when such local infections spread and regional lockdowns must be ordered”, said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
The SPD shares a similar view: “We have asked for a special control program also for farms with harvesters after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse mid May”, said the environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“Especially the hygiene conditions at the work place and the living quarters must - in our view - thoroughly checked.
And that obviously did not happen.”
The outbreak occurred “predictably”.
Aidenbachstrasse underground station: Dangerous brawl: 19-year old falls to track bed after being pushed
During an argument between two groups of youths at the Aidenbachstrasse underground station, a 19-year old was pushed to the ground and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - At around 4:15 p.m. on Friday, there was a quarrel between two groups of youths at Aidenbachstrasse underground station.
A passer-by alerted the police, and a number of officers attended the scene.
Initial inquiries indicate that a youth (17) from Munich pushed a 19-year old man to the floor.
The young man then slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
Members of the 17-year old’s group helped the man who had fallen to climb back on to the platform.
There was no danger from an oncoming train.
As reported by the police, the two young people then resumed their dispute.
The 17-year old initially fled from the scene, but his identity was later verified.
His father accompanied him to police station number 29.
The 17-year old is under investigation for causing bodily harm.
U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous fight: A 19 year-old fell onto the track after being pushed
A 19 year-old fell onto the track after being pushed during a fight between two groups of young people at U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße.
Obersendling - A fight broke out between two groups of young people at U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße at 16:15h on Friday.
A passerby called the police, who called-up multiple squad cars.
Following initial investigations it seems a boy from Munich (17) pushed a 19 year-old to the floor.
This resulted in the young man slipping over the edge of the platform and falling onto the track.
People in the 17 year-old’s party helped the fallen boy climb out of the track bed.
There was no danger of a passing train.
Another scuffle followed between the two persons, according to the police.
The 17 year-old proceeded to flee the crime scene, however, his personal details could be retrieved later.
He reported to the 29th police station with his father.
Assault charges are being pursued against the 17 year-old.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
But according to a media report, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, is calling for an extension of the retention period.
His aim is to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for data retention to be extended - for six months rather than ten weeks.
As “Bild am Sonntag” reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) for a quick change to the law in a letter.
It reports that Seehofer’s intention is to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it is a good idea “to make urgently required changes to the law now”, the paper quotes the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
An ECJ decision on it is still outstanding.
However, Seehofer wants the changes beforehand so that they can be applied immediately if the verdict is positive, the report goes on to say.
A Justice Ministry spokesman told the paper that they could only really look to see whether legal change is necessary once the courts have reached a decision.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the federal states’ interior ministers had previously argued in favor of data retention back in June.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer telecommunications data retention
Telecommunications data retention is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is pushing for a lengthening of the retention period according to a press report.
He would like to support thereby the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minster of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is pushing for a longer data retention period: a half-year instead of the current ten weeks.
As reported by the “Bild am Sonntag”, Seehofer asked the Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for an express change to the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen provisions against child abuse thereby.
He thinks that it makes sense “to take up pressing, necessary alterations to the law now,” the newspaper quoted from his release.
Telecommunications data retention is suspended at the moment.
This is waiting on a decision from the EuGH.
However, Seehofer wants the alterations earlier, so that as soon as a likely, positive judgement is handed down, it can be implemented immediately, the letter further stated.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper, that the need for legal alterations shall first be sensibly reviewed following a decision from the court.
Already in June Seehofer spoke together with the interior ministers of the states in favor of telecommunications data retention in their fight against child abuse and child pornography.
NBA: Strip club problem for Clippers star Lou Williams
Trouble in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro with the Los Angeles Clippers, had supposedly left the tournament accommodation in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission to attend a funeral.
But according to US media reports, he visited the “Magic City” strip club in Atlanta that evening.
Williams, who, according to ESPN, has apparently admitted to the visit, is back in isolation and being tested every day for Covid-19.
The reason for his visit? Chicken wings.
Back in February last year, “Sweet Lou”, as he is known in the NBA, expressed his liking for those same wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Ed. ) have the best wings in the city”.
On Sunday NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter that the NBA had ordered Williams to go into quarantine for ten days.
This means that the Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the test game phase.
The NBA is aiming to play out the coronavirus season in Disney World.
The best 22 teams are currently playing training games in preparation for the season finale which begins on Friday night.
NBA: Strip-club problems for Clippers star Lou Williams
Uproar in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, seems to have left the tournament district in Disney World (Orlando, Florida) with permission to attend a funeral.
According to US media channels, he then proceeded to visit the “Magic City” strip club in Atlanta that evening.
Williams, who according to ESPN admitted to his visit, is in isolation again and is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: chicken wings.
“Sweet Lou,” as he is called in the NBA, had already expressed his love for just these wings in February of last year.
The American wrote: “Magic City and Blue Flame (editorial note: another strip club in Atlanta ) have the best wings in the city.”
NBA insider Shams Charania let it be known on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA had subjected Williams to a ten-day quarantine.
That is how the Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test-match phase.
The NBA will play out the season in Disney World.
At this moment, the 22 best teams are preparing with training games for the season finals that begin this Friday night.
Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
So we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser range finders.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.
So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.
So this is not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So basically that's how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
And I truly believe that this can happen.
But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.
And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.
This is priceless.
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Söder makes a statement about coronavirus situation after mass infections
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) already announced a testing offensive for large farms on Sunday.

No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is being delivered.
The authorities are now offering free coronavirus tests to the almost 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the farmhands had little contact with the local population, the district office is currently assuming that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.

The case in Mamming, district Dingolfing-Landau, has alarmed authorities and politicians.
On the large vegetable farm are currently working almost 500 harvesters from several countries; more than one third are infected with the Corona virus.
In the meantime the farm has been quarantined; the farm is blocked off with a construction fence.
Nobody may leave the premises, food is being delivered.
The authorities are offering free of charge Corona tests to the about 3300 locals of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local residents the district administration assumes so far that infections have not spread beyond the farm.
“Pangs of conscience”: Confession of the alleged Nantes arsonist
“My client has cooperated,” lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense counsel added, “He very much regrets his actions, and his confession came as a relief to him”.
His client was “plagued by pangs of conscience and upset by the extent of the damage”.
The prosecution service say that, if he is convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a 150,000 euro fine.
Last Saturday night, the Gothic St Peter and St Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged by a fire.
The fire broke out at three separate locations in the church.
Laboratory investigations firmed up the suspicion of arson.
The suspect now in custody was detained just hours after the fire.
But after a day he was released.
The man works for the Nantes diocese in a voluntary capacity and he was responsible for locking up the cathedral on the evening before the fire.
As there was no evidence of forced entry into the church, he quickly came under the scrutiny of the investigators.
“The Pain of Remorse”: Confession from the suspected arsonist of Nantes
“My client has shown himself to be very cooperative,” the Lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense counsel added: “He regrets his actions very much, the confession was liberating for him.
His client was “plagued with remorse and really taken back by the extent of the damage”.
In the case of a verdict, the man is looking at ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros according to the prosecution.
The gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul of Nantes was heavily damaged after a fire last Saturday.
The fire broke out in three places in the church, which were at a considerable distance from one another.
Laboratory investigations corroborated the suspicion of arson.
The detained suspect was already arrested just a few hours after the incident.
However, he was let go after just a day.
The man was a volunteer for the Nantes diocese and was responsible for closing down the cathedral the night of the fire.
Because there was no sign of a violent break-in to the church, he was quickly under the eye of the investigator.
Discussion about scrapping the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thought be given to scrapping the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates any fait accompli,” Grindel told “Bild am Sonntag”.
He said, “In any case the 50+1 rules don’t work for those clubs that are most likely to threaten Bayern and Dortmund - look at Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In any case, you can’t get around the debate as to whether it shouldn’t be made easier for clubs that are aiming to break into this grouping to engage investors.
But he doubts whether there is a willingness within the German football league to allow majority shareholdings which are prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
“There is a legal risk involved in putting up investment barriers around the Bundesliga as a business hub in a European internal market,” said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees a danger that “the attempts to create a greater competitive balance in the Bundesliga could, in the end, merely weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more suspense in the championship”.
Even evenly distributing TV monies will not have any decisive effect.
“FC Bayern have revenues of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So even between the top three clubs there are immense differences.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,” explained the 58 year old.
Looking back, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there were individuals who noticed that error and went to the press rather than speak to me about it,” said Grindel about his acceptance of an expensive watch, which led to his resignation in April 2019.
“On a human level, that hurt me a lot”.
He had received the gift, valued at around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian functionary.
“I committed a compliance violation and it was right to accept the consequences,” said Grindel.
“I was completely transparent and honest about the dubious gift of the watch.
Many people at the DFB knew about it”.
He had never “made any secret of the gift”, affirmed the 58 year old.
“You might call that naive, but this type of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption”.
Discussions over abolishing the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel recommended discussions about phasing out the 50+1 rule.
“German Football should at least discuss setting clear rules and requirements for investors before the EU Commission finishes up with all of the details,” Grindel told the “Bild am Sonntag”.
He continued: “The 50+1 rules don’t work at all for the clubs that would most likely be a danger to Dortmund and Bayern: just look at Leipzig and Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether to make it easier for clubs, which want to break into this Phalanx, to include investors.”
He has doubts, however, about whether the German Football League is ready to allow majority stakes, which are prevented in the league by the 50+1 rule.
“There is a judicial risk in putting up investment barriers around the Bundesliga’s business locations in the European Single Market,” said Grindel.
The former DFB head sees a danger that “the attempt to secure fairer competition in the Bundesliga would only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on the European level, and not lead to more excitement in the championship”.
Even distribution of TV funds would not even produce a decisive result.
“FC Bayern has a revenue of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig a revenue of 300 million.
The difference even between the top three clubs is already immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of about 130 million,” clarified the 58 year-old.
Grindel feels betrayed when looking back at the past.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and have leaked it to the press instead of bringing it to me directly,” Grindel said referring to the acceptance of an expensive watch, which lead to his resignation in 2019.
“The morality of that has weighed heavy on my mind”.
The 11,000 euro watch was a gift from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a breach in compliance, and it was right that I reap the consequences of that,” said Grindel.
“I circumvented innocently and with complete transparently with the ominous watch gift.
Many in the DFB knew about this”.
He never “made a secret out of the present,” reassured the 58 year-old.
“One could call it naive but this form of transparency was the exact opposite of corruption.”

Rakoczi in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes despite virus
Even though the spa town lacked the big party atmosphere, both visitors and performers enjoyed the flair of the alternative Rakoczi program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organisers alike. The Rakoczi weekend with no Rakoczi party.
However, even if the big party was absent from the town center, many people still got to enjoy the alternative, Covid-compliant program, including the crowds of people and highlights such as the Saale burning, the Rakoczi ball and the parade.
“I think we succeeded in creating plenty of Rakoczi flair,” said Spa Manager Sylvie Thormann.
It went down well with the guests.
In principle, it was a return to the beginnings of the Rakoczi Festival, when everything focused on the historic aspects.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been attending the Rakoczi Festival in Bad Kissingen with her husband for over 25 years.
She did so in this Covid year, too.
The couple settled down at the Luitpold Casino, watched the historic characters promenade, and listened to live Cuban music from the casino’s restaurant.
“I’m think it’s still really pleasant like this,” said Konhäuser.
She wasn’t missing the crowds of people which are usually associated with the Rakoczi.
However, she was missing the usual program highlights, particularly the burning Saale on Friday evening, the historic parad,e and the closing firework display on Sunday evening.
“It’s certainly a shame.
The weather was absolutely spot-on this year,” she felt.
Rakoczi horse show to be held again
For some of those portraying the historic spa guests, the alternative program meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold who, in a normal year, takes part in the parade where she can be seen on the spa garden cafe’s carriage.
This year she spent Saturday and Sunday walking around town in her costume.
“It’s certainly more effort, we usually have things easier,” she said.
The riding club had less to do, even though a few riders were trotting around the park.
“We really hope that the riders’ quadrille will be held again next year,” said President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She said that a Rakoczi horse show would also be held again in 2021 after a hiatus of several years.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes in spite of corona
Although the great pub crawl through the Kurstadt didn’t take place, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for victors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even though the great party mile in the city center was missing, including the crowds and program highlights like the burning of the Saale, the Rakoczy Ball or the parade, many still came in their costumes to the corona-conforming alternative program.
“I think we still succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair,” said the Kurstadt director, Sylvie Thormann.
The guests seem to have taken it well.
One looks back to the founders of the Rakoczy festival as a matter of principle, because the historic is the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy Festival in Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
Even this time during the corona year.
The pair made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watched the historic figures as they wandered and heard live Cuban music at the Spielbank Restaurant.
“I find it really pleasant even this way,” said Konhäuser.
She didn’t miss the crowds that are normally a part of Rakoczy.
However, she did miss the rest of the program highlights, most of all the burning of the Saale on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the concluding fireworks on Sunday evening.
“It is a shame.
The weather this year would have made it perfect,” she said.
The Rakoczy horse show is supposed to take place again
The alternative program meant more work at times for the historic guest performers.
This is true for Christina Gold, who in a normal year helps out with the parade and can be seen there ridding in the carriage of the Kurgarten Café.
This year she was out and about in the city in costume on Saturday and Sunday.
“That was pretty stressful, usually it’s easier for us,” she said.
The riding club had less to do even though individual riders were out in the park.
“We are hopeful that the rider’s quadrille will take place in the coming years,” said Chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that a Rakoczy riding tournament should also be taking place in 2021 following a multiple year break .
28 coronavirus cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
Spanish second division football club Fuenlabrada is slipping ever deeper into a crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
One blow has followed another since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on 20th July despite some cases of coronavirus.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had tested positive, with one hospitalized, the club reported.
Until now Fuenlabrada, from the eponymous town south-west of Madrid, had had a chance of reaching the promotion playoffs.
Now they are even threatened with relegation to the second division’s B Group.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the public prosecutor was investigating a possible offence against public health, and the leading sports authority, the CSD, was considering imposing relegation on the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine in a hotel.
“They were given no fresh towels and no shower gel until their sixth day of quarantine,” wrote sports paper “AS”.
Photos show that players have hung up underwear and club clothing in their hotel rooms after apparently having had to wash them themselves.
Neither had the bedding been washed for five days.
Food is another problem.
It is neither good nor enough,” wrote “AS”.
The club’s management stated that they are satisfied with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, hit back at the accusation that they had committed an offence against public health.
Javier Tebas, who is the son of the President of Spain’s Primera Liga, said that they had not contravened the football association’s coronavirus regulations, reported news agency Europa Press and sports paper “Marca”.
Before flying, four people had been infected prior to 19th July, and they had all isolated and did not travel.
All the players and team members were retested immediately before the flight to A Coruña.
Once the team was in A Coruña “five or six” more team members then tested positive for coronavirus.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before kick-off, said Tebas Llanas.
28 corna cases for the Spanish second-league club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second-league club CF Fuenlabrada are sliding even deeper into crises following a corona outbreak.
One heavy blow has followed the next since the newcomer from the area around Madrid flew to the city of A Coruña to a game on the 20th of July in spite of their first corna case.
The club reported that 28 players tested positive for corna as of Sunday, one was taken to the hospital.
Fuenlabrada from the titular city south-west of Madrid still had the chance to make the advancement playoffs.
Now a fallback to the B group of the second-league is a very real possibility.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña on the previous Monday was cancelled in the last moments, the state prosecution was investigating a possible offense against public health, CSD, the highest sport authority, pondered a forced degrading of the club.
The players as well as all team members are sitting in a hotel in quarantine.
“Up to six days of quarantine and they have not received a fresh towel or any gel,” wrote the sports newspaper “AS”.
Photos are seen of how the players are hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bedding has also not been changed for five days.
Food is yet another problem.
It is neither good nor enough, writes “AS”.
The club management on the other hand say they are happy with hotel management.
The claim, that they intentionally harmed public health, is rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
No one breached corona regulations as laid out by the football association, said the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper “Marca” reported.
Before departure there had been four infections up to the 19th of July, all of them were isolated and did not travel along.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
As the team arrived in A Coruña, there were “five or six” further team members who had positive results from the corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle blow, said Tebas Llanas.

Frankfurt/Main - Seven time world champion time trialist Tony Martin can certainly see himself continuing his cycling career.
“At the moment I’m talking with the team to work out exactly how we can continue,” the 35-year old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and, prior to the coronavirus break, he had been thinking about ending his career after this year.
The negotiations with his team include discussing the number of race days, he said.
Plus other issues that would affect him as a father, he added.
After falling, he used to get up and his first thought was, “Get back on the bike quickly!
Now, as th father of a little girl, I think: what if?”.
Martin admitted that there are issues that he finds increasingly difficult.
“But it did me good, during the virus, to see what I’ve got from cycling and how much I enjoy it”.

The number of riding days is the subject being discussed by his team, he said.
Or it’s about other problems bothering him as a father, he continued.

Now I am thinking as a father of a small daughter: what would happen, if...”
The bicycling professional granted that there were many aspects, which have been hard on him.
“But it was good for me during this corna time to notice how much I have with bicycling and how much fun it was for me”.
The time-travel specialist gets back into a competitive event with the Tour de l’Ain (5th to 9th of August).

Kovac tested as Monaco play Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac is soon to play against Eintracht Frankfurt again with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champions are set to visit the Hesse outfit, the Croat’s previous club, on August 1st (6 p.m.).

Only a few have so far been occupied.
It is difficult to get people to Cox’s Bazar.
There is limited enthusiasm, too.
Those who used to own a house, albeit small and hut-like, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment building.
Many of the apartments are vacant, but the government wants them to soon be occupied by those who have lost their house to the floods.

More than 120 Indian rhinoceroses died following landslides in Kaziranga National Park.
They are a protected species and in danger of extinction.
The floods were especially bad this year, which scientists have connected to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries hardest hit by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the south of Bangladesh, the city of Cox’s Bazar built living spaces for 650 people affected by the flood.
Only a few have moved in at this time.
It is hard to get people to Cox’s Bazar.
Many are keeping their excitement within bounds.
People who previously had a house, even if it was small and resembled a hut, will often not want to spend their lives in large apartment blocks.
Many apartments are empty, but they should be filled soon by people who have lost their homes to the flooding, at least the government would like it that way.

Argentina rejects creditors’ counter-offer
The new claim could not be settled, the Finance Ministry in Buenos Aires stated on Saturday.
“It would be not just irresponsible, but unjust too,” a statement explained.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina are living in poverty, we cannot increase our creditors’ short-term profits”.
The debts of the second-largest national economy in South America are no longer sustainable under the current terms.
As a result, Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around 66 billion US Dollars (about 59 billion euros).
Should no agreement be reached, the country will once again be threatened with bankruptcy.
That would be the ninth debt default in Argentina’s history.
Creditors have recently demanded higher interest rates on government securities, and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentinian government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in the middle of a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently above 50 percent.
Experts are expecting a decline in economic output of around ten percent this year.
In late May, Argentina failed to make interest payments of 503 million US Dollars, so it slipped into partial debt default.
Argentina declines creditors’ counteroffer.
The Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires said on Saturday that the new demands could not be met.
“It would not only be irresponsible but also unjust” one statement read.
“We cannot increase the short-term profit of our creditors while 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty”.
The debts of the second-largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to forgive a portion of their circa 66 billion US dollar debt (about 59 billion euros).
A government default is looming if no agreement is reached.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
The creditors recently requested higher interest on government bonds and changes to individual clauses of the contract.
However, the government of Argentina is sticking to its last offer and did not provide further concessions.
Argentina is stuck in a severe financial and economic crises.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
Experts are expecting a decline of economic strength of about ten percent in the coming year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims of about 503 million US dollars and thereby slid into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet personally
“It’s going really well” Dr. Stefanie Kramer drew this conclusion after her first days in the notary’s office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: In Mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she was taking Lutz Feller’s old position in the Eggenfelden notary’s office.
Six weeks later, in early July, the doctor of law began work, and normal daily business has been at full speed for a while.
“However, I still have to arrive personally,” she says in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course the short lead time was not enough to time to completely move the center of her life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the Dingolfing native.
She is currently searching for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge on the district court.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave to be able to ensure their two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old) are cared for.
So as not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she can stay with her parents in Dingolfing for now, says the 39 year old.
Having grown up in the neighboring district, she is of course very familiar with the city of Eggenfelden.
When visiting on site with her family in recent months, she once again noticed: “Eggenfelden is a really nice little city.”
So she was all the more happy when she found out she had won the race for the position in the selection procedure.
Even in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her home of Lower Bavaria plays a key role: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as a notary public, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labor law “on the side” - she started her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, this was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then she has been doing representative services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden opened up due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw it as the right time to make the full re-entry into her career, says the 39-year old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the predecessor’s team, who will in the future take over the notary’s office for vacation representation - and already has praise for the office’s team: “It’s going really well!”
The fact that she can rely on the smooth-running processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private life.
In terms of kindergarten or daycare places, she has already contacted the local facilities.
And if everything goes as she hopes, she will be able to pursue her hobby here as well - and get to know the best jogging routes in the Rottal.
Professionally achieved - privately not there yet.
“Everything goes very well” - Dr. Stefanie Kramer concludes after er first days working in the notary’s office in Eggenfelden.
In the end everything went very fast. Middle of May Dr. Stefanie Kramer had learned that she would be the successor of Lutz Feller in the notary’s office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later in the beginning of July the graduated jurist started working, the normal daily work is already in full swing.
“Privately, however, I still have to reach my goals”, says Stefanie in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger, and laughs.
Naturally, the short lead time was not enough to transfer the center of her life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden said Stefanie who was born in Dingolfing..
Currently she and her husband who is a judge at the district court in Regensburg were still searching for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least, her husband were able to apply on short notice for parental time to be able to take care of their two daughters (3 1/2 and 1 1/2 years old).
In order that she didn’t have to commute from Regensburg every day she found overnight accommodation at her parent’s house in Dingolfing, explained the 39 year old.
Since she grew up in the neighboring county she is quite familiar with the town Eggenfelden.
When she visited the town with her family in the past months she again realized: “Eggenfelden is a really beautiful town.”
Therefore she was so very pleased that she won the job in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland Lower Bavaria plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional carrier: After her law studies in Passau she completed her traineeship and her 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several employments as notary assessor - among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Lower Allgäu as well as in Regensburg - during this time she also - like ‘in passing’ - completed her doctorate in labor law and then started her first ‘real’ job as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she applied for parental time which was followed with her move to Regensburg.
Ever since then she accepted substitute services in several notary offices.
When the vacancy in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller she anticipated the right time for a professional full re-entry had come, explained the 39 year old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer adopted the entire team of her predecessor who will become vacation replacement in the notary’s office - and she instantly had only praise for the notary office’s team: “It goes extremely well!”
It makes it easier for her to be able to rely on established routines and thus to have time to taking care of the pending transfer of her private life center point.
Regarding kindergarten respectively nursery places she has already established contact with the local facilities.
And if everything goes as desired she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby again - namely to learn about the most beautiful jogging areas of the Rottal.
BVB plans for up to 15,000 fans when new season opens
Dortmund Germany’s largest football stadium, in Dortmund, will not even be 20 percent full at the start of next season should fans return.
“Because of the rules on distancing we have to comply with, we are currently planning for between 12,000 and 15,000 fans”, Borussia Dortmund director Carsten Cramer told "Tagesspiegel".
The Dortmund arena normally holds a little over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga games.
Last season BVB lost around four million euros per match as games were played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Cramer, who is Head of Marketing, Digitalization and Internationalization at BVB, is hoping that they will be able to open up some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area, as well as the normal seats. “Of course, it’s a financial blow if all of this revenue is lost.”
Given the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, everyone would be “well advised to adopt a recovery position to begin with”.
“If a lot companies are having difficulties and 6.8 million people are working reduced hours in Germany alone, the need for entertainment is limited,” explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB players for giving up part of their salary in order to help get through the crisis, “Of course, the players know that giving up their salaries has a different effect than if we reduce the working hours of 100 people in merchandising.”
BVB is planning to start the league launch with maximum 15,000 spectators.
Dortmund - The Dortmund’s football stadium, the largest in Germany, won’t even fill up to 20 percent capacity as fans return for the start of the season.
“Because of isolation regulations, which must be enforced, we are planning for 12,000 to 15,000 spectators as things stand now,” said Borussia Dortmund’s manager Carsten Cramer to “Tagesspiegel”.
Normally, the arena in the Dortmund has more than 81,000 spectators during Bundesliga games.
Last season’s ghost games, a result of the corona pandemic, caused about 4 million euros in loses per game for the BVB.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization for BVB, hopes that the circa 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened up, in addition to the normal spectator seats: “Obviously it is a blow to the business if this income is just completely lost”.
As a result of the ongoing corona crises, everyone is now “well advised to first get into a stable position.”
Cramer explained, “if it is not going well for many companies (about 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work) then the need for entertainment is limited.”
Dortmund’s head of marketing praised the BVB professionals for having part of their salary waved, which contributes to overcoming the crises: “Of course the players know, that by having part of their salary waved, it causes a much different effect than 100 people in merchandising having to be put on short-time work.”
Tiny miracles: Early life start at only a couple hundred grams
Scarcely heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body. That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed precisely 273 grams.
The tot is one of around 400 premature babies that the Graz Children’s Hospital cares for each year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, while a couple, such as Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael, are extreme lightweights whose birth weight is not even a kilogram.
They are so small and born so early that their lungs, intestines and muscles are not fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that an ECG’s electrodes can damage it.
And they are so tiny that, for a while, they wear dolls’ clothing and diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they have no voice - “And how!”, smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
“Even though they don’t cry as loudly as large babies, of course”.
Small wonders: An early start to life with only a few hundred grams

They are so small and born so early, that neither their lungs, their intestines nor their muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that the electrodes from an ECG can harm it.
They are so small that sometimes they wear puppy clothing and special mini diapers designed just for them.
However, they are not so small that they don’t already have a voice, “and how’s that,” smirked Berndt Urlesberger.
“Even if they don’t scream as loudly as big babies, of course.”

Kalbitz sacking from Alternative from Germany confirmed - FDP speaks of “fig leaf”
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a “fig leaf” from the FDP’s point of view and doesn’t change anything about the party’s character.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is just the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,” FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the expulsion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of deliberation, the Federal Executive Committee had decided this in May by majority.
Kalbitz is the chair of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
“If the AfD were really serious about consistently removing right wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have been removed long ago,” says Strasser.
“However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.”
CSU secretary general Markus Blume expressed a similar opinion: “The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is excluded now says nothing and changes nothing,” he told the “Welt am Sonntag.”
"Instead, it says a lot about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the AfD.”
Blume assumes that the AfD will continue to land less than 5 percent in future elections.
“The AfD’s days in the parliaments are numbered.”
Kalbitz was one of the advocates of the official, now disbanded, “wing” around the Thuringia AfD state and faction chair Björn Höcke, which had been classified as a “secured right-wing extremist endeavor” by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
In May, the AfD federal board threw Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason they gave was that Kalbitz was a former member or the now forbidden right-wing extremist group “Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend” (HDJ) when he joined the party and did not tell the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies the membership in the HDJ.
The chair of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, emphasizes that the decision of the federal arbitration court doesn’t change anything about the character of the AfD: “This is still a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
The AfD is still a right-wing extremist party, with or without Kalbitz.”
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
“The Meuthan squad’s maneuver is transparent.
They want to evade further observation by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to fly under the radar,” says Walter.
“The AfD won’t be rid of the spirits they have conjured up.
A removal changes nothing,” says the Brandenburg SPD secretary general Erik Stohn about the decision in the Kalbitz case.
“The AfD state association and the faction stood by their right-wing leader until today.”
The legal dispute about Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, Kalbitz announced he will dispute the decision of the federal arbitration court in civil court.
Kalbitz expulsion from the AfD is confirmed - FDP calls it ‘fig leaf’.
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is - in the FDP’s view - only a ‘fig leaf’ and doesn’t change anything about the party’s character-
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD”, said the FDP politician Benjamin Strasser, specialist for domestic affairs, to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD’s federal arbitration court had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz after several hours of hearing on Saturday in Stuttgart; the AfD’s federal board had decided the expulsion with majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD fraction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
“If the AfD is really concerned about removing right wing extremists from its party then officials like Björn Höcke and also his followers would have been expelled a long time ago”, said Strasser.
“For that there is not political will apparent in the AfD because the right wing extremism belongs to the party by now.”
Similar statements come from the CSU secretary general, Markus Blume: “That Andreas Kalbitz now remains expelled does not say anything and changes nothing”, he said to the “Welt am Sonntag”.
“It rather says a lot how many frenetic supporters a right wing extremist still has in the midst of the AfD.”
Blume assumes that the AfD will land again below five percent in future elections.
“AfD’s days in parliaments are numbered.”
Kalbitz was spokesman of the ‘wing’ around the Thuringia AfD state and fraction chairman Björn Höcke that had been dissolve officially by now; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ranks the movement as ‘severe right wing extremist attempt’.
In May the AfD federal board threw Kalbitz out of the party.
Reason for that was that Kalbitz did not inform the party when applying for membership about his earlier membership in the meanwhile forbidden “Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend (HDJ) and with the ‘Republikaner’.
Kalbitz denies his membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left fraction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also insisted that the decision of the federal arbitration court would not change the character of the AfD. “The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a right extremist party whether with or without Kalbitz.”
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor its right wing.
“The maneuvers of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
They want to escape further observations by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and they try to keep ‘under the radar’”, said Walter.
“The AfD can’t get rid of the ghosts it had called on.
An expulsion does still not anything”, was a comment of the Brandenburg SPD secretary general, Erik Stohn, about the decision in the case Kalbitz.
“The AfD state association and the fraction stood by their right wing leader.”
The legal dispute about Kalbitz’ membership in the AfD will continue.
Kalbitz announced on Saturday he will fight the decision by the federal arbitration court in civil court.
North Sea Wind Farms Deliver 21 Percent More Electricity
The wind power stations on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That’s a good 21 percent more than the same time period in the previous year, said the grid operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transmitting the North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it on through the German power grid.
The wind power stations on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to Tennet’s grid area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind yield on the sea therefore makes up 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide for additional generation capacities
The increased yield from offshore wind energy is due to, in addition to the wind conditions, increased generation capacities, because new wind parks have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind power stations in the North Sea were to all run at full power simultaneously, they could technically generate 6.7 gigawatts of power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient, as according to Tennet, the capacity is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, this should increase in the German North Sea to 17 gigawatts.
“In Germany and in the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in to expanding the offshore grid connections,” says Tennet CEO Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks cannot exhaust their capacity, even on the sea, but rather achieve about 40 percent.
The current record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind parks generated more than six gigawatts of energy.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of power, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
They could therefore supply nearly seven million households with power.
The North Sea wind parks deliver 21+ percent more power.
The wind power plants of the German North Sea delivered 11.51 terawatt hours electricity to the net in the first six months of the year.
That is about 21 percent more compared to the same time period of the last year, informed network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the North Sea power transfer and the routing through the German power net.
The wind turbines in the Baltic Sea that do not belong to Tennet’s network delivered another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) power.
Altogether, wind generated power from the North and the Baltic Sea generated 13.73 TWH compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half year 2019.
The wind power harvest resembles thus almost 19 percent of the entire wind power in Germany; this is about four percent more than last year.
New wind parks feature higher generation capacities.
The increased contribution of the offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities beside the wind conditions because new wind parks came into the net within the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea would all work with full speed they could generate calculated 6.7 gigawatt energy.
The transfer capacity is sufficient for that; according to Tennet it could handle 7.1 gigawatt.
Until 2030 the capacity should increase to 17 gigawatt in the German North Sea.
“Until then we will invest 20 billion Euro in the expansion of the offshore net connections in Germany and the Netherlands”, said Tennet manager Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality wind parks also at sea cannot exploit their full capacity but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day in this year was January 2nd when the North Sea wind parks generated more than six gigawatt power.
On average the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt energy; that corresponds with three to for nuclear power plants.
With that almost seven million households can be provided with power.
Art “Skirmish” - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold at the Gmünd Art Association gallery.
This was akin to a small anniversary celebration for the 130th
Gmünd Art Association: The exhibition opening “Skirmish” with work from the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the mold after the hiatus caused by coronavirus.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialog between the artist and the chair of the art association, professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band “Defenders of the Universe” on the southern located Kornhausplatz square.
The association “Sandtogether” was involved to the north of the gallery.

Freital: Windberg Festival cancelled due to coronavirus
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival that was planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
“We have genuinely not made this decision lightly and, being aware of how financially tough it is for those involved, we were hoping up until the last minute,” explained Mayor Uwe Rumberg (independent).
“But ultimately, as the organizers, we are responsible for the health of several thousand people”.
Because if tens of thousands had poured into the festival area and the marquee, we wouldn’t have been able to comply with the virus rules on social distancing, hygiene regulations and contact tracing.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much of the festival atmosphere would have remained.
The organization and monitoring costs would also have multiplied and been disproportionate.
Rumberg was consoled by thoughts of next year.
The city of Freital will then be celebrating its’ 100th birthday, with festivities including Winterberg Festival from 7th to 9th May 2021 and Saxons’ Day from 10th to 12th September 2021.
Freital: The Windberg Festival was cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the planned three-day festival in September.
The city festival has received up to 30,000 visitors in past years.
“We honestly didn’t make this decision lightly - conscious of how financially difficult it will be for those involved - we hoped up to the last moments,” clarified Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Independent).
“But as event organizers we are responsible in the end for the health of thousands of people”.
If tens of thousands of people during the festival had taken to the festival grounds, no minimum distance, hygiene concepts or contact tracing could be maintained as stipulated by current Corona protection ordinances.
Otherwise, the restrictions would have been so extreme that not much of a folk festival would have remained.
Furthermore, the organizational and monitoring expenses would have disproportionately risen by a multitude.
Rumberg is consoled thinking of next year.
That is when the city of Freital will celebrate its centennial with the Winterberg Festival as well as Saxony Day from the 10th to the 12th of September 2021.
Olympic dressage champion Werth unbeatable in Achleiten

More future air traffic controllers in Worms
The University of Applied Sciences Worms continues to reach for the sky: The DFS (Deutsche Flugsicherung) is to fund a professorship in Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding agreement has now been signed by the University of Applied Sciences Worms and the DFS in Worms.
The agreement is initially for three years and will begin in 2021.
This professorship will enable studies to commence not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and at the DFS’ air control management academy will be utilized equally.
The DFS will advise the university on setting up the professorship and filling the position.
Represented at the university since 2019
The first students have been working on the Air Traffic Management course as part of their air traffic control training at Worms University since the 2019 summer semester.
Nine students have started this year already.
To date the DFS has had very positive experiences, as the students have performed excellently.
The combination of course work and air traffic control training is very much helping to make the profession of air traffic controller more attractive.
“Funding doesn’t come easily to us at the current time.
But we believe that air transport will recover and grow again in the long term.
We need highly qualified personnel if we are to be able to meet our statutory remit going forward,” said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, the DFS Chairman as the agreement was signed.
“For the DFS, the endowed chair is an investment for the future which, over the long term, will give air traffic controllers a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base.
So we shall be continuing our excellent collaboration with the university and, at the same time, underpinning our appeal as an employer”.
This was also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms, “The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between academia and business.
With it, we wish to link in to the existing collaboration with the DFS as our practical partner for the dual bachelor degree program in Air Traffic Management.
For Worms University, the faith shown by the DFS provides both motivation and an obligation to further develop its teaching and research skills in the future areas of air transport.
With this first endowed chair for a dual degree program, the university will be able to offer the air traffic controllers of tomorrow some excellent highlights and innovations.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry for Science, Education and Culture, said, “With its focus on the air transport sector, Worms University has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
The signing of the collaboration agreement today will strengthen the university’s profile”.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms is reaching higher up into the air: The “DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung” is founding a professorship for “Air Traffic Management”.
A corresponding agreement between the college and the DFS was signed in Worms.
The agreement was initially concluded for three years starting in 2021.
For this professorship it is possible to begin studying in winter semester as well as in summer semester.
In that way, twice as many students can be educated as before.
At the same time, the capacity of the college as well as the air traffic control academy of the DFS carry the burden equally.
The DFS will also advise the college in the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Representing the college since 2019
Since the 2019 summer semester, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management program at Worms University as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.
Nine students are already starting this year
Up till now, the experience of the DFS has been very positive, the performance of the students has been commendable.
The combination of study and air traffic control training is contributing significantly to the attractiveness of the air traffic control profession.
“In these times, economic support is not easy to come by.
We are counting on air traffic to pick up again and to grow again in the long run.
We need highly qualified personnel in order to be able to fulfill our legal agreement in the future,” said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head chairman of the DFS at the signing of the contract.

Air ambulance lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was completely closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday lunchtime as an air ambulance was deployed following a traffic accident.
At around 12.40 pm a 76 year old driving a Ford went straight into the curve at the Alzenau-Mitte exit and hit the crash barrier.
The collision triggered the front airbags, causing the drive to suffer slight injuries to his face, and meaning he had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The paramedic treated the 72 year old passenger’s injuries and the patient was then flown to hospital in the air ambulance.
The police currently believe that there is no danger to life.
With damages valued at around 2000 euros, the vehicle had to be towed away.
An emergency rescue helicopter landed on the A 45
The A 45 Autobahn in the direction of Aschaffenburg was fully shut down for 30 minutes on Saturday around noon as an emergency rescue helicopter was deployed following an auto accident.
Around 12:40h a 76 year-old in a Ford drove straight through the curve of the Alzenau-Mitte exit ramp and collided with the crash barrier.
The front air bags were released as a result of the collision, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and must be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72 year-old passenger were treated by the emergency medic and the patient was flown to the hospital in the emergency rescue helicopter.
At present the police assume that there is no danger of death.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered circa 2,000 euros in damages, needed to be towed away.
Heil intends looking at other sectors after the meat industry.
The coronavirus crisis has again exposed conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Tightened laws on the way
But are they legal - and will they stick?
Following on from the tough rules that are now planned against failings in the meat industry, the Federal Minister of Employment, Hubertus Heil (SPD), is also intending to look at other sectors.
“We shall study them sector by sector and then, if required, take suitable measures for the sector concerned,” Heil told the Deutsche Presse agency in Berlin.
German employers are already warning against generally restricting work contracts.
After the massive coronavirus outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet is intending to enact one of Heil’s laws this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses will no longer be permitted to employ third party staff for slaughtering, cutting or meat processing.
And the use of work contracts and temporary staff is also set to be banned.
Employers’ President Ingo Kramer told the dpa, “Stay away from any general restriction on work contracts and contract staffing if you don’t want to completely choke the economy”.
For example, for broad sections of the skilled crafts sector, the construction industry and plant engineering, work contracts are the very basis of their added value for the customer.
“Individual failings cannot ruin a key instrument like this.”
Heil promised, “My aim isn’t to ban work contracts everywhere in German business.”
Work contracts make good sense.
“When an industrial company hires a skilled person to install a safety system, that’s a completely normal work contract”.
The German meat industry believes that banning work contracts and temporary employment in their sector alone is unconstitutional.
There was no explanation as to why, in the future, the employment law applied to cutting up and packaging cheese should be different to that applied to sausage, said a statement on the planned legislation, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" reported (Saturday).
Were there to be a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo.
Many Eastern European workers in contractor companies in the sector were sometimes working 16 hours per day, according to the findings of an investigation by NRW’s Employment Protection Office.
They often had no breaks.
Wages were held back for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that workers’ accommodation situations were often poor.
Heil said that a relatively tough law for the meat industry had been passed in 2017.
But they had been circumvented by “cunning systems”.
“Now a complete deep-clean is required”.
The politician said, “The employment protection law that we in the cabinet want to pass in late July also contains measures that affect not only the meat sector - for example, higher check rates for employment protection and clear criteria for shared accommodation”.
The draft available to the dpa contains amendments to the law on safeguarding employee rights in the meat industry and the employment protection law.
Brandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes tighter controls are necessary.
“I’d like to be able to carry out even more inspections in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport too,” Nonnemacher said in the RBB program "Brandenburg aktuell" on Sunday.
But more staff would also be required for any increase in inspections.
Heil would like to investigate other industries after the meat industry
The corona crises brought conditions in parts of the meat industry to light once again.
A strengthening of the laws is on its way.
Are they legal, and will things remain like that?
The Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to investigate other sectors after the currently planned, strict measures against abuses in the meat industry.
“We are going to look at industry after industry and for each respective industry take suitable measures where needed,” Heil said to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
German employers are already warning about limiting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat empire Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to conclude this Wednesday a law from Heil.
Large slaughter houses are no longer able to use external staff for slaughtering, disassembly and meat preparation.
The use of contracted and temporary workers is also forbidden there.
President of employment Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: “Take your finger away from general restrictions on contract labor and personnel leasing if you don’t want to completely stall the economy.”
Service contracts are necessarily a fundamental part of value creation for customers in, for example, large sectors of craftsmanship, construction and plant manufacturing.
“The misconduct of individual actors may not destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assures: “My goal is not to ban contract workers in general from the German economy”.
Contracts for work make sense.
“When an industrial operation contracts a craftsman to construct a security system that is a very normal contract for work.”
The German meat industry claims that a ban on contracts for work and temporary labor in their sector exclusively would go against the constitution.
It has yet to be made explicit why proportioning and packaging of cheese should have different worker rights in the future then for sausage, claimed a statement on the legislative proposal as reported by the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung “ (Saturday).
The user price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product as the result of such a ban.
Many Eastern European laborers from contract for work companies work in the branch according to findings from an investigation of NRW worker protection administration, some of them 16 hours a day.
Often there are no pauses.
Pay is reduced for protective equipment and for rent.
It was made clear that the housing situation for the employees was often miserable.
Heil said, that in 2017 a relatively strict law was put into place affecting the meat industry.
It was largely ignored, however, through, “devious designs”.
“Now it really needs to be fundamentally cleaned up”
The politician announced: “In the worker protection law that the cabinet would like to conclude at the end of July, which does not just effect the meat industry, rather, for example, leads to higher examination quota for worker protection and clear criteria for shared accommodation.”
The draft laying before the dpa includes changes to the law to secure employee rights in the meat industry as well as the worker protection law.
Brandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) sees intensive oversight as necessary.
“I would like that we could do even more checks in many areas of regulation: Monitoring of food, animal protection, everything that is possible, for example animal transportation,” said Nonnemacher am Sunday in the RBB program “Brandenburg aktuell”.
More checks are also necessary for staff personnel.

Car flips over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Highway 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries at around 1:25 p.m. on Sunday in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
The fire service used infrared cameras to search for any possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was driving towards her home town of Humme on Highway 83 when, for some unexplained reason, her car left the road and flipped over several times.
The fire service had to cut the car roof away to save the casualty.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, an infrared camera was deployed from the turntable ladder to search the adjacent cornfield.
The drone section from Warburg, who also work with infrared cameras, was also called up for the search.
However, the rescue workers failed to find anyone amongst the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to Kassel Hospital for further treatment.
Almost 50 rescue workers from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire services attended the location.
The accident caused the highway to close for two hours.
Auto rollover: A young woman was severely injured on Federal Highway 83 near Hofgeismar.
A 21 year-old woman suffered serious injury after an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday around 13:25h.
She was brought to the clinic in Kassel.

In order to free the unfortunate driver, the fire department had to cut open the roof of the car.
The surrounding cornfield was searched from on top of an aerial ladder with a thermal imagining camera, because it was unclear whether she was driving with anyone else in the vehicle
The drone squad from Warburg, which was also working with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered for the search.
In any case, emergency personnel didn’t find anyone between the tall corn stalks.
The severely injured driver was brought in an ambulance to the clinic in Kasseler for further care.
Just under 50 emergency personnel from the fire departments of Hofgeismar, Hümme und Schöneberg were on location.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the incident.
Juventus of Turin Italian champions
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus of Turin, who hold the record for the number of Italian league championships won, have secured the title for the ninth time in a row.
The team, including five players dubbed World Footballer Of The Year wrapped up their 36th Scudetto in the club’s history on Sunday evening by winning 2:0 (1:0) in their home game against Sampdoria of Genoa.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1:0 before half-time.
With two more matchdays to go before the Serie A season ends, Turin have 83 points and can no longer be knocked off top spot, but are playing without former German international Sami Khedira who has been injured for some time.
Inter Milan, who are currently second in the table, are seven points behind.
In the first half, despite their apparent superiority, Juventus caused little threat, but then Ronaldo scored from a set-piece free kick in the last action before the break.
With a low shot, the 35 year old converted a Miralem Pjanic pass from the edge of the area (45+7).
With the visitors now attacking more, Ronaldo was also involved in making it 2:0, after Federico Bernardeschi (67) helped with his shot.
That ensured the lacklustre but crucial victory.
When he hit the bar from a penalty in the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself, with one eye on the battle to be top scorer, would have really been annoyed.
“It’s tough to stay on the ball, both mentally and physically, for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very easily,” explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 against Udinese on Thursday.
In particular, his players were mentally exhausted, said the Juve coach.
The defeat meant that the Turin outfit was unable to seal the title in a perfect manner.
Recently Juve have had their rivals’ weaknesses to thank for the gap at the top of the table, which was comfortable in the end.
Because Sarri’s team had only won five out of the eleven matches prior to Sunday’s game.
And whether Ronaldo will end up top scorer is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, after his hat trick in the 5:1 (1:1) against fourth-placed Lazio of Rome, former Dortmund star Ciro Immobile has 34 goals to his name - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed in FC Bayern’s title win.
Gonzalo Higuaín, now with Juve, holds the Italian record.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
The next opportunity for the “Old Lady” of Italian football to win a trophy will come in August.
Juventus are in the quarter final of the Champions League, but they have to make good a 0:1 deficit from the first leg against Olympique Lyonnais on 7th August if they are to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would await them as their opponent in the next knockout round.
Juventus Turin Champion in Italy
Turin - After a liberating goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, the record-holding champion Juventus Turin secured itself the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team with the five-time World Player of the Year now has 36 in total. Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night at home against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo made it 1:0 before halftime.
Turin, which has been playing without the long-injured, former national team player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to be ousted from first place with 83 points and two game days before the end of the series A season.
The second position on the chart is occupied by Inter Milan, who is 7 points behind.
In spite of visual superiority, Juventus was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo scored with the final move after a free kick.
A pass from Miralem Pjanic lead to the 35 year-old standing right in front of the penalty line with a low shot (45.+7).
Working against guests who were now playing on the offensive, Ronaldo was also able to take part in making it 2:0, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) cleaned up after his shot.
That is how this dull but sure success was secured.
The penalty shot that bounced off of the crossbar in the 89th minute must have only angered Ronaldo himself given his top scorer rank.
“It is hard to remain mentally and physically on the level of the ball for 90 minutes.
Games are strange and can change easily in a moment”, trainer Maurizio Sarri clarified after a 1:2 against Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The mental exhaustion of his players is substantial on top of everything else, said the Juve coach.
Because of this defeat, Turiner was still not able to secure the championship with a perfect record.
The jump to the top of the charts was in the end particularity attributable to the weakness of the competition.
This is because the Sarri team had only managed five victories in the eleven games leading up to the game on Sunday.
It remains to be seen whether Ronaldo will remain the top scorer.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals up till now, Ciro Immobile, who previously played for Dortmund, has 34 goals to his name after his triple score for a 5:1 (1:1) against 4th ranked Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy goes to the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian player scored 36 goas for SSC Neapel in the 2015/2016 season.
The “Old Lady” of Italian football is waiting till August for their next chance at a title.
Juventus is in the round of 16 of the Champions League and needs to set off a 0:1 first-leg defeat against Olympique Lyonnais on the 7th of August in order to reach the finals tournament in Lissabon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would then be waiting as an opponent in the next KO round.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - In spite of all threatened penalties and court decisions, drivers continue to put the pedal to the metal in numerous illegal races on roads in Baden-Württemberg: Over the last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal races.
There are no comparison values for the years prior, but the racers are creating increasingly more work for legal authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 preliminary proceedings were conducted for illegal racing at the public attorney’s offices between Constance and Mannheim - one year later, it was already 252 and this year it has already reached 151 at the start of June.
According to the response from the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD, the races are not really organized events.
In most cases, the drivers have met up spontaneously or they had fled from the police - this is also registered as illegal racing.
Drivers were primarily German males aged 18 - 60.
113 fines - 15 arrests
The racers are only arrested in relatively few cases and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been charged since 2018 and 15 prison sentences issued.
But there are no indications that the number of illegal car racers is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers are reacting more sensibly than before due to the countless tragic accidents and lawsuits over the past years and are reporting incidents more often, said a ministry spokesperson.
Highway 8 is particularly popular among racers. Drivers are always stopping traffic there to create space and use the open section for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, an three months before that, there were also 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular “race track”
The police actually register more races on the A81 than any other federal highway.
A speed limit there is being used to thwart the racers on a particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The usually high-priced and tricked out sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers often come to Germany due to the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit shouldn’t be restricted to a few routes: “A general speed limit of 130 km/h would get rid of this problem on highways,” says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert from the SPD state parliament faction.
“The inhibition threshold for racers would be much higher if they couldn’t still legally drive at 200 km/h here and there.”
Rivoir doesn’t think much about education or image campaigns: “You can’t use reason to reach anyone who defies all the rules like this and not only puts their own life, but the lives of others at risk.”
ADAC calls for stronger measures by the police
But for the ADAC, this is not enough: “We assume that racers are not scared by the speed limits,” says Holger Bach, department head for Traffic and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He is calling for additional and harsher controls on the affected sections.
The high-speed trials of strength sometimes have painful and serious consequences: Between January 2019 and April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a crash at night in Stuttgart’s inner city and one in Gerlingen.
Two men allegedly had a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles flew off the road, crashed into a garden fence and landed on its side, the 18-year old passenger died.
21 other people have been injured in the races in the past two years.
More stringent penalties, however, are not necessary according to the Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: The Ministry of the Interior’s paper states that “we see no need for legislative action to sanction illegal car racing more strictly.”
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races reported
Stuttgart - Despite impending punishment and court decisions drivers still join numerous illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg. In the past year and the first four month of this year the police in the Southwest has already registered more then 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative numbers for the previous years but the speeders create increasingly work for the juridical authorities. 155 investigative proceedings due to illegal races were performed at public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim in the year 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were hardly performed as organized events, as it was concluded from a reply of the interior ministry to an inquiry of the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases the drivers would compete with one another spontaneously or they had tried to flee from the police - that is also reported as illegal race.
The cars were driven predominantly by German men in the age between 18 and 60 years old.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparably a few cases the speeders are caught and then fined accordingly. According to the interior ministry altogether 113 fines and 15 imprisonments were imposed since 2018.
However, there are no real indications that the number of illegal car races does in fact increase.
It is rather a act that other drivers react more sensitive to these races than previously due to some tragic accidents and trials in the past years, and they report them more frequently, said a spokesperson of the ministry.
The speeders love to race especially on the Autobahn 8. Time and again drivers slow down the traffic there to make room and use the free road for a race.
Past August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months prior to that even 18 drivers were caught on the A 8 close to Merklingen.
The A 81 is the most favorable “race track”.
The police registers even more races on the A 81 than on any other federal autobahn.
With an imposed speed limit it is attempted to slow down the speeders on the especially frequented section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly expensive and tuned-up sports and luxury cars frequently sponsor Swiss license plates because the drivers evade to Germany due to the high penalties for driving too fast and for car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD speed limits must not be restricted to only a few sections of the roads. “A general speed limit of 130 km/h would do away with this problem on the autobahns”, says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD Landtag fraction.
“The psychological barrier for speeders was significantly higher when one could travel - still legally - here and there at 200 km/h and more”.
Rivoir does not think too much of enlightenment of image campaigns. “Whoever violates all rules in such a way and who risks not only his or her own life but also the life of other road users, he or she can hardly be reached with rationality”.
ADAC demands more drastic police measures
For the ADAC is this, however, not enough: “We assume that speeders are not deterred by speed limits”, says Holger Bach, manager of the department Traffic and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
He demands additional and also stricter controlling of the respective road sections.
Quite often the high-speed showdowns end in hurt and serious consequences: Since January 2019 until April 2020 three people died state-wide in races, two of them who were non-participants at a nightly crash in the Stuttgart inner city and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were said to have had a car race in November.
One of the vehicles strayed from the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18 year old passenger died.
21 other people were injured at races in the past two years.
However, tougher penalties are not necessary according to the secretary of the interior, Thomas Strobl. “We don’t see a legislative need for action to sanction illegal car races even harder”, a paper of the interior ministry states.

Control center gave CPR instructions
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident in Garath on Sunday afternoon
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while having a bath.
According to the fire service, the emergency call came in shortly before 1 p.m.
“A control center agent immediately gave CPR instructions,” a fire service spokesman told BILD.
When they arrived shortly afterwards, the paramedics took over the resuscitation efforts.
Clinging to life and still receiving CPR, the child was taken to the university hospital.
It is unclear why he died.
The police have opened a routine investigation into the accident.
The fire service spokesman said, “We’re assuming that this was a tragic accident in the apartment.”
Dispatch center gives instructions for layman resuscitation
Düsseldorf - A tragic accident near midday on Sunday in Düsseldorf-Garath.
A child (4) was suddenly lying lifeless while bathing in an apartment building.
According to the fire department, the distress call came shortly before 13h.
“Dispatch at headquarters immediately requested layman resuscitation,” a spokesman of the fire department said to BILD.
The dispatched rescue team took over the resuscitation procedures shortly after.
The child whose life was in danger was transported to the university hospital while receiving resuscitation.
The reason why it was unsuccessful is unclear.
The police registered it as a routine course of events following an accident.
The spokesman of the fire brigade: “We are assuming a tragic accident occurred in the apartment.”
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning rally - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and, at times, over 1000 people took part in a “tuning rally” on Saturday night in a furniture store car park.
The police carried out their threat to clamp down more severely on this type of event.
A large tuning rally was held on Saturday evening (25th July 2020) in south Nuremberg.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia Police, at around 10:30 p.m. the Nuremberg Traffic Police noticed an increase in traffic in the area of a large car park in Ingolstädter Strasse.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
Only recently the police announced that they would take a firmer approach against so-called auto posers.
Illegal tuning rally in Nuremberg: Only a few from the “scene”
At its peak, the officers counted a good 700 vehicles and around 1100 people.
However, only a small number of those present were categorized as “auto posers” or part of the tuning scene.
It seems that most people came to the scene after the police appeal.
Judging from the vehicles and individuals present at the location, it is believed that most of them were curious bystanders.
Moreover, the majority of those present were complying with infection regulations, particularly observing minimum distances and wearing face coverings.
The checks carried out at the location finished at around 1 a.m.
In all, the officers identified 10 vehicles with modifications such that permission to operate them was withdrawn.
Four of these vehicles had to be impounded.
No car racing
No illegal car races took place.
“The Central Franconia Police Headquarters will continue to bear the incident in mind and will continue to carry out checks, including in connection with the volume of curious bystanders,” it was stated.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company that was involved, “They all have nice wheel rims, and we had to avoid scratching them,” said Schrödinger.
Special bands were used for that purpose.
And because the cars are wider, the company had to take care that no damage was done.
“After all, the youngsters need to get their cars back unharmed”.
Nürnberg: Police intervene in an unauthorized tuning meetup with 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people.
Hundreds of cars and over 1,000 people showed up to a tuning meetup Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police have announced their intention to more strictly regulate such events.
A large tuning meetup took place in a city south of Nürnberg this Saturday evening (25 July, 2020).
Many hundreds of vehicles took part.
According to Mittelfranken Police, an increase presence of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot near a street in Ingolstadt was determined at 22:30h by Nürnberg Police.
That is why the police then carried out multiple vehicle inspections there.
The police have only recently announced their intention to take stronger action against so-called “car posers”.
Illegal tuning meetup in Nürnberg: Only a small portion were from the ‘scene’
Authorities counted a max. of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to police.
Only a small portion of those present were part of the “car poser” or the tuning scene.
Apparently, the larger part of the pertinent scene complied with police appeals.
Judging from the vehicles and persons who were found there, the overwhelming majority were simply curious spectators.
In addition, the overwhelming majority of those present were complying with the relevant infection protection measures, especially by maintaining minimum distance and wearing a face mask.
The control measures that took place there were finished around 1:00h.
In total, the police found 10 vehicles who had the type of structural changes, which would invalidate their operating license.
Four of these vehicles needed to be seized.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
“The Mittelfranken Police Headquarters will keep the incident in mind, thus leading to further, stronger enforcement measures, even in connection with spectators,” they said.
The News5 agency spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the contracting towing company: “They all have beautiful rims, which we are not allowed to scratch,” Schrödinger said.
Special bands were used.
The company needed to pay even closer attention not to cause damage, because the cars themselves are wider.
“Young people should get their cars back unharmed in the end.”
Figures from the employment agency: 900 suspicious cases of abuse of short-time working hours
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) says it is investigating around 900 suspicious cases of abuse of short-time working benefits.
“With more than 880,000 companies reporting reduced working hours, this is an extremely low number,” board member Daniel Terzenbach, who is responsible for the operational business, told the “Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung.”
When a lot of companies suddenly applied for reduced working hours when the coronavirus crisis began, the BA had to respond quickly.
The review normally takes up to three weeks.
“We did not have that much time during this intense phase.
So we will therefore look at the final settlements all the more closely.
There will surely be more to come.
We are also not naive and have a lot of patience.”
Employees or trade unions concerned often reported the abuse.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of bankruptcy in the fall.
“Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
Estimates differ, but we are preparing for the worst case scenario and are already training our employees at employment agencies how to process applications for insolvency payments.”
The numbers are still unremarkable,” said Terzenbach.
Numbers from the employment agency: 900 cases of suspected abuse of short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is pursuing about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term work.
“Given the 888,000 companies who reported short-term work, that is an extremely small amount,” management board member for operations Daniel Terzenbach told the “Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung”.
When many companies suddenly applied for short-term work at the beginning of the corona crises, the BA needed to react quickly.
Normally the review process lasts up to three week.
“We didn’t have that kind of time available to us in this critical phase.
That is why we will look even more closely at the final accounts.
There will certainly still be more to come.
We are not naive about that and we have endurance”.
The evidence of abuse often came from affected employees and unions.
The BA’s analytics software was then used to detect the patterns of abuse.
The BA is preparing for a likely wave of insolvencies in Autumn, according to Terzenbach.
“Will there be significantly more insolvencies then last year?
The estimates are diverging from one another, but we are arming ourselves for a worst-case scenario and are already training our employees in the employment agency to process applications for insolvency money”.
The numbers are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party broken up in New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 adolescents were had a party in New Garden.
The gathering was broken up at 8:48 p.m. by the motorized patrol of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said in response to PNN’s request.
The adolescents then left the park.
Then, on Saturday evening, a group of adolescents played rugby in New Garden.
The lawn was cleared by the motorized patrol, said SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are frequently illegal parties in the parks
There are frequently gatherings in the foundation’s parks where the social distancing and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 contact ordinance cannot be maintained.
At the end of June, there was a party with about 300 people in Park Babelsberg, one week later about 150 people partied in New Garden.
Even without the coronavirus ordinance, the parks are closed when it gets dark.
Camping on the lawns is prohibited according to the park ordinances, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors always leave behind trash and would destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a new dimension.
In the Hasenheide park in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people had an illegal techno party Saturday night.
The police broke up the party.
World heritage in Potsdam: Party in Neuen Garten dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday night about 40 young people attended a party in the Neuen Garten.
The assembly was dissolved at 20:48 in the evening by the precinct drivers of the foundation Prussian Palaces and Gardens (SPSG), informed the foundation at a PNN information request.
The youths subsequently left the park.
On Saturday evening some young people played Rugby in the Neuen Garten.
The meadow was cleared by the precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Illegal parties happen again and again in the parks.
In the foundation’s parks there are repeated gatherings where the distance and hygiene rules according the Covid-19 directive are not being observed.
At the end of June there was a gathering of about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 persons had a party in the Neuen Garten.
Even without Corona directives the parks are being closed at nightfall.
Camping on the grassland is omitted according to park ordinance, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation keeps on complaining that visitors leave behind more and more garbage; this would destroy protected biotopes.
Illegal park parties have meanwhile reached other dimensions in Berlin.
About 5000 people attended an illegal techno-party in the night before Sunday in the Hasenheide in the district New Cologne.
The gathering was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass testing after coronavirus outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak with hundreds of tests in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to regional authorities in Linz.
By the evening, over 100 results were still outstanding.
They report that many of those infected are young interns in tourist businesses, though at least one holidaymaker had also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism personnel were asked to remain in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
An 11 p.m. curfew was set.
“There have been cancellations here and there,” the Head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, told the dpa.
A few guests had also departed early.
St. Wolfgang is the biggest tourist resort in Upper Austria, with over 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one third of visitors are German.
The first infections were announced on Friday.
On Saturday the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns, who had been partying in various bars and could have become infected there.
“We all enjoyed doing that when we were young,” he told the Ö1 radio station.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association initiated an information campaign to raise young employees’ awareness of the dangers of Covid-19.
Then, from Saturday, hundreds of staff, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
All visitors who had been to St. Wolfgang since 15th July were also contacted.
The outbreak is a reminder of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tirol, which was a center for the spread of the virus throughout Europe in the initial phase of the pandemic.
Over 1500 people, in all, are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
Vienna and Upper Austria have particularly high levels of new infections.
Austria: Mass tests after an outbreak at a tourist destination
Authorities have reacted to a corona outbreak in the beloved St. Wolfgang tourist destination in Upper Austria.
The number of confirmed cases has risen to 48 according to the regional authorities in Linz.
More then 100 results were still pending in the evening.
Furthermore, many of the infected are young interns in the tourism industry and at least one tourist also tested positive.
Locals, guests and tourism workers are asked to remain in their dwellings Saturday evening.
Curfew was set at 23h.
Bookings “have been cancelled here and there” the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association Hans Wieser said to the dpa.
Individual guests have also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, just about a third of the guests are German.
The first infections were made public on Friday.
The head of district authorities, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns on Saturday, who have vacationed in multiple locals and could have been infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he said to the Ö1 radio broadcaster.
In any case, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association started an informational campaign to increase awareness among younger employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Hundreds of employees, tourists and locals have been tested since Saturday.
All guests who were in St. Wolfgang since the 15th of July have been contacted.
The breakout brought to mind the ski resort and party local Ishgl in Tirol, which was a center for the spread of Corona in all of Europe during the initial phases.
More then 1,500 people in total are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
Concentrated points of infection are Vienna and Upper Austria.
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
It's infant mortality.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa)- The English soccer record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year being absent.
The Red Devils secured the third ranking on the last day of play in the Premier League with a 2:0 (0:0) win against direct competitors Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to content themselves with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea passed them and qualified in fourth place for the Champions League.
Aston Villa can celebrate in the fight against relegation.
Manchester United took the lead thanks to a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City during injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored the final goal.
Chelsea, opponent to FC Bayern in the Champions League quarter finals, won in parallel thanks to Mason Mount (45th minute + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th minute + 4) with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“This means a lot to me,” said trainer Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as the Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspurs also benefitted from Chelsea’s victory against Wolverhampton, moving past Wolves with a meager 1:1 (1:0) victory at Crystal Palace and starting in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the standing battle with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but were nervous about staying in the league when playing West Ham United.
The late lead by Jack Grealish (84th minute) was immediately equalized by Andrej Jarmolenko (85th minute).
The 1:1 (0:0) sufficed though, because Watford lost at Arsenal 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which sacked three coaches this season, is being relegated after five years in the top league.
Just like Bournemouth, which couldn’t save itself with a 3:1 (2:1) win at FC Everton.
They were missing a point in the end.
FC Liverpool, which has already been crowned the English champion since the end of June, set a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the most that the Reds have ever achieved in a single soccer season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just narrowly missed the point record in English soccer.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/2018 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th minute) turned the tide for Liverpool on Sunday.
“It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club,” said goal scorer van Dijk after the game, “this should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be tough.”
The Premier League bosses may also be happy in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, soccer in England was halted from March 13 to June 17.
In between, there was even talk of ending the season early or playing the rest of the games on neutral territory.
Ultimately, however, the season was played out to the end without incident - although, like in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for the champions league
London (dpa) - The English soccer record champion Manchester United returns to the champions league after one year of absence.
The Red Devils secured the third place ranking on the last game day of the premier league through a 2:0 (0:0) victory over the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be content with the European league because they got also passed by the FC Chelsea which qualified also for the king’s class with a fourth place ranking.
Aston Villa could celebrate in the fight against the relegation.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card against Leicester City in extra time Jesse Lingard scored for the final score(90 + 8).
Parallel to it won Chelsea, in the champions league round 16 opponent of the FC Bayern, thanks to Mason Mount (45 + 1) and Oliver Giroud (45 + 4) with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“That means a lot to me”, said coach Frank Lampard who finds himself also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
From the Chelsea victory over Wolverhampton benefitted the Tottenham Hotspurs which passed the Wolves with a meager 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and which starts in the Europe League with a sixth place ranking.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel against the FC Watford and the AGC Bournemouth but had to fear for its stay in the class for a long time at West Ham United.
The late lead by Jack Grealish (84th) was equalized promptly by Jarmolenko (85th).
However, the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club which fired three coaches during the season descends to a lower class after five premier league years.
Exactly like Bournemouth that could save itself even with a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.
At the end one point was missing.
The FC Liverpool which had secured the English championship already since the end of June also achieved a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score that the Reds ever achieved in a soccer season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp with his team only narrowly missed the points record in English soccer.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the season 2017/18.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the match in favor of Liverpool.
“For this great club it was an extraordinary season”, said scorer van Dijk after the game, “that should motivate us to defend the title.
It will be difficult”.
The premier league bosses could also be content at the end.
Soccer schedules and operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17 due to the Corona virus crisis.
In the meantime one discussed even a premature cancellation or a holding of the remaining games on neutral grounds.
Finally, the season could however be completed without special occurrences - but like in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against the government head Netanyahu are becoming more intense.
There were violent clashes overnight.
The Israeli police took violent action against participants of a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu Saturday night in Jerusalem.
Two people were arrested for their participation in the unrest, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
The police used water cannons, among other things, to break up the demonstration.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people in total gathered near Netanyahu’s official residence on Saturday night.
They were protesting against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protestors beat drums, blew horns and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, reports the news site “ynet.”
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police information, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv, because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray on demonstrators on the edge of the street out of a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator suffered a minor neck injury.
There have been multiple demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The demonstrations are accompanying the corruption trial against the head of the government.
Netanyahu has also been recently criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Among other complaints, he has been criticized of loosening restrictions too soon and not being well-prepared for a second wave of the coronavirus.
The coronavirus crisis has severely impaired the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate was most recently at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections of coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new records.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanjahu.
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanjahu become more frequent.
Violent confrontations occurred last night.
The Israeli police acted forcibly against participants of a demonstration against the right-conservative head of government Benjamin Netanjahu during the night before Sunday.
Twelve people had been arrested due to participation in unrest, informed police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld.
Among others the police used water guns to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports altogether around 6000 people had come together near Netanjahu’s official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, used trumpets and demanded Netanjahu’s resignation.
As the news site “ynet” reported participants of a counter demonstration which supported Netanjahu were also arrested.
In many other locations in Israel people demonstrated, among others, in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal town Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police a man was arrested near Tel Aviv since he is suspected to have sprayed pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators at the roadside.
Another man was arrested in the south of the country after a knife attack on a demonstrator.
The demonstrator was slightly hurt in the neck area.
Previously there were several demonstrations against Netanjahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Finally, Netanjahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
He is accused, among others, for hasty easing of lockdowns and an insufficient preparation of a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has significantly hurt the country’s economy.
Lately, the unemployment rate was at 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel increased most recently to always new record figures.

North Korea closes off border city after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea views its own measures to protect against the coronavirus as a “gleaming success.”
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official suspected case of coronavirus in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a major city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defensive measures in the past six months, “the virulent virus was still able to make its way into the country,” reports the state media.
A state of emergency has been called for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communistic government rang the highest alarm level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea has so far not registered any infections, and has described its defensive measures as a “gleaming success.”
The statements have been doubted abroad.
According to the reports, symptoms of the illness were found in a “runner” who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person defected to South Korea three years ago and has now returned over the border.
South Korea initially has given no confirmation of the border crossing within the military buffer zone that is four kilometers wide and is still mostly covered with land mines.
According to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea’s military considers the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high.
There are ongoing investigations of several people.
According to its own statements, North Korea called an urgent meeting of the workers’ party politburo, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, regarding the suspected case on Saturday.
The “dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster.”
Kim already arranged “to completely block off Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from each other as a preventative measure,” it continues.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who may have had contact with this person, have been placed under quarantine.
According to this, the party’s central military commission is set to investigate the “runner case” and the behavior of the responsible military unit, as well as possibly imposing strict punishments.
According to estimates, approximately 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
North Korea isolated a border town after Corona suspected case.
Up to now North Korea saw “brilliant success” in its own measures defending against the Corona virus.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspected case.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country North Korea cordoned off an entire major city fearing a catastrophe.
Despite strict epidemiological defensive measures in the past six months “the evil virus could have been brought in into the country”, reported the state media.
The state of emergency was declared for the region around the border town Kaesong.
The Communist leadership raised the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the sealed off country.
Up to now and according to its own indication North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures a “splendid success”.
This information was doubted overseas.
According to reports the symptoms were detected in a ‘runaway’ who had crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had defected to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the borders.
So far there was no confirmation from South Korea about the border crossing within the four kilometer wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap South Korea’s military admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea were rather high.
Some people would be investigated in that regard.
According to own reports North Korea summoned an emergency meeting of the politburo of the Labor Party chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un.
The “perilous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe”.
It is further reported that Kim had ordered already on Friday - as preventive measure - “to block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and the entire region from others”.
The respective person as well as all other people in Kaesong who were in contact this person had been quarantined.
The party’s military committee should thus investigate the ‘runaway case’ as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if need be, apply severe punishment.
About 300000 people live in Kaesong according to estimates.
Tension before council meeting: East of the city and noise protection are up for discussion before the big summer break
“In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project of the inner city east development,” states the middle section of the city’s press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the large hall of the Congress Centrum Pforzheim.
However, the betterment of the eastern side of the city remains a bitter discussion to the very end.
The majority being in favor is tight, most recently even being rejected in individual committees, depending on attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed from the citizens and then by the administration of the municipal council, fail after nearly ten years of preparation was criticized by project critic Reinhard Klein as “extra-parliamentary opposition,” “naive,” “speculation,” “denigration” and “deliberate false statements.”
“Everyone thinks they know better,” says Klein, who has been part of the municipal council for a year as the only representative from the citizens’ party ticket of Pforzheim.
In fact, he said this was his position after reading the contracts: “I know what I am talking about.”
Abandoning the project would be cheaper for the city - contrary to the city administration’s statements, the technical city hall could be renovated for EUR 8.5 million with grants, the existence of which Klein is convinced of.
The city will develop very differently than predicted in the town hall and by the advocates from the local economy.
Designing the city on our own and not by an investor: That’s his plan B. One day later, Klein presented an alternative concept to the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, who also rejected the project.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the technical city hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting out the former Thales for administrative space, and a smaller inner city redesign in an ideal case with local providers.
Environmental topics play a key role
In addition, environmental issues play a key role here.
That is why the municipal council will also vote on the noise abatement plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Profzheim population against harmful noise caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, local Verkehrsclub Deutschland [local chapter of German traffic club] welcomes the widespread introduction of a 30 km/h speed limit. City policy makers are partly to blame that this must be introduced, because they neglected the urban bus traffic with thinned out routes, and were not committed to bicycle traffic so that it lead to a massive increase in car traffic and therefore the noise level, says the Verkehrsclub Deutschland.
The municipal council will also vote on the city’s participation in the energy and climate protection agency of Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, entry into the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, redefining parental contributions to city daycare centers, and the application to be included in the federal government’s Smart City funding are all on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but must take a coronavirus protective measures.
Tensions before the council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still up for debate before the long summer break.
“Beside environmental concerns the members of the board must vote - among others - on the development plan for the major project Inner City Development-East”, it states rather casually in the midsection of the city’s press release referring to the next local council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 16:30 in the large hall of the Congress Center in Pforzheim.
Especially the appreciation of the Eastern part of the city will be controversy discussed till the end.
The majority for that is tight, most recently even dismissive in the various committees depending on the members present.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) to not let the project fail now after almost ten years of preparation, a project that came straight from the citizens and that was developed by administration and local council; this appeal was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as “extra-parliamentary opposition”, “clueless”, “speculation”, slander” and “conscious false statements”.
“They all think they know better”, so Klein who is a member of the local council for one year as the lone representative of the Citizen’s List Pforzheim.
In fact, he would be in this position after he had read the contracts: “I know what I am talking about”.
The withdrawal would be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall could be renovated for 8.5 million Euro contrary to statements from the city administration, namely after grants, which are real in my view.
The city would develop in totally different ways, different from what they forecast in city hall and from what is said by economics.
The city must grow through its own strength and not through investors. That would be his plan B. One day after Klein the FDP/FW/UB/LED fraction, which also dismisses the project, presented an alternative concept.
It stipulates essentially also the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the keeping open of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a small-scale redesign of the inner city ideally with local public sponsors.
Environmental concerns play a central role.
Beside that environmental concerns will in particular play a central role.
Therefore, the local council will, among others, vote on a noise protection action plan.
This plan contains diverse measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health related noise pollution caused by road traffic - some of the measures are speed reductions.
In a press release the local automobile club Germany welcomed the introduction to a speed limit of 30 km/h. The politicians responsible in the city are not free of blame that it had to come to that because they neglected the public bus service with reduced cycle times and because they showed little interest in building up bicycle lanes - all that lead to a massive increase of the car traffic and thus contributed to the increased noise, stated the VCD.
The local council will also vote on the city’s participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Entkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the environment protection pact of the State Baden-Württemberg, the new adjustment of parental contributions to the city’s children day care centers and the application for entry in the Federal smart-city-support program.
Citizens are welcome but must comply with Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann is starting the new season with a big delay
With almost a half of a year delay, Tim Zimmermann is starting his debut season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the supercar league can resume regular operations, the first test runs must be performed.
For Zimmermann, this was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The coronavirus has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from being able to take his first drive in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This has now been possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargen native drove his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get comfortable on his debut in the GT3 car.
“There are a few things that are different than with the Porsche from last season,” says Zimmermann.
“You can corner differently with the ABS, for example.
But it was really a ton of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst with whom he will share his orange sportscar in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in the GT sport, despite only being 25 years old, and was able to help his new team colleague with many things.
“I’m not a beginner at motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges with it,” says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I get along wonderfully and we’ve made tremendous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session.”
The GT Masters will also have its first race here, at the Lausitzring.
33 supercars will race through the Lausitz on July 31.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newbies, knows the track though.
In 2015, he was a guest at the Motodrom.
“It worked quickly and I had to get used the track a little,” says Zimmermann, who raced for the Friedrichshafen racing team Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passages that you have to hit perfectly to be fast.”
We’ll find out in two weeks how fast Zimmermann actually is.
“The teams of course push their luck a bit on the tests,” he says.
“Ultimately, though, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend on the Lausitzring.”
The race in Brandenburg will be the kick-off to a tightly-packed calendar.
There are seven races on the docket by early November.
Currently no spectators are allowed - but there will be one prominent guest.
In mid-August on the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT wheel.
Tim Zimmermann starts into the season with a great delay
Tim Zimmermann starts in his premier season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann it was first of all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 much closer.
The Corona crisis prevented for a long time that Tim Zimmermann could tackle his first official test drive in his new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was possible now under special hygiene conditions.
The 23 year old from Langenargen spun his first rounds at the Lausitzring and could get a feel for his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are indeed a few things that differ from the Porsche of the previous season”, says Zimmermann.
“With the ABS one must for example take curves quite differently.
But I had really great fun with it”.
Zimmermann had also fun with Steijn Schothorst with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The man from the Netherlands is quite experienced in the GT sport despite his young age of 25 years and he could help his new teammate with many things.
“I am not at all a beginner in motor sports but each new series brings along new challenges”, says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I understand one another splendidly and at the Lausitzring we enormously progresses from season to season”.
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also complete its first race.
From July 31 on the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmerman who is one of the 15 series newcomers does, however, know the race track.
Last time in 2015 he was guest in the motodrom.
“It worked very fast and I had little problems adjusting to the track”, says Zimmermann who starts for the Friedrichshafen race collective Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you must meet perfectly in order to be fast”.
How really fast Zimmermann will be that remains to be seen in two weeks.
“All teams play poker a bit when testing”, he says.
“In conclusion we are very satisfied and we are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring”.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a very busy schedule.
Until the beginning of November seven races are planned.
Current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there will be a prominent guest.
Mid August at the Nürburgring ex-Formula-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will also grab a GT steering wheel.
British traffic minister caught with his pants down by quarantine decision
The decision of the British government to place Spanish vacationers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the traffic minister of the country with his pants down according to press reports.
According to the reports, Grant Schapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Due to the coronavirus numbers in Spain rising again, the cabinet in London struck the country from the list of countries you can return from without going into quarantine.
The new regulation goes into effect today, which means Schapps needs to go into quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for those returning from vacation.
But the regulation applies to those who are on vacation starting on the cut-off date, which is Saturday August 1, and it was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Austria has considered Spain as one of the “safe countries” to date, and does not require any quarantine upon returning to Austria.
“Countless ministers must have known in advance that it was possible that a quarantine would be imposed for people vacationing in Spain,” commented the Labor representative Diane Abbot.
“But apparently no one made the effort to tell Grant Schapps.”
Less than a month after the end of the coronavirus state of emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict lockdown, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists are pinning the recent spread on night life above all.
Spain is one of the most popular vacation countries among Brits.
The British government is advising against traveling to the Spanish mainland unless necessary, excluding the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British tourists.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
British secretary of traffic caught off guard by quarantine decision
The decision of the British government to quarantine Spain vacationers after their return for two weeks had caught the country’s secretary of traffic off guard, according to press reports.
According to that, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation of all things in Spain while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Because of the re-increasing numbers of Corona infections the cabinet in London removed Spain from the list of those countries from where an entry was possible without quarantine restrictions.
The new ruling is valid from today, Sunday, and thus Shapps has to be also quarantined after his return.
The Austrian government decided also on quarantine measures for returnees.
But their ruling applies to those who are only just on the effective day on vacation, only from Saturday August 1 on, and it was not introduced over night.
By the way, up to now Spain is considered in Austria as one of the “secure countries” for which no quarantine is necessary in Austria.
“Numerous secretaries probably knew in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine is issued for Spain vacationers”, commented the Labor representative Diane Abbot.
“However, nobody took the trouble to inform Grant Shapps about it”.
Just one month after the end of the Corona state of emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict curfew the infection numbers in the country are increasing again.
Virologists make the nightlife responsible for the anew spreading.
Spain is one of Britain’s most favorable country.
Currently, the British government discourages from unnecessary travels to the Spanish mainland, except for the Canary and Balearic Islands which are especially favored by British vacationers.
So far 272.000 infections with the new Corona virus and more than 28000 deaths have been reported in Spain.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On Navy Day in his country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships will be equipped with the latest hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, a world first, would increase the Russian naval forces’ fighting options, said Putin in St. Petersburg on Sunday at the central navy parade.
Afterwards the Defence Ministry also notified the Interfax agency that the Zirkon hypersonic missiles built for the navy had been tested successfully.
The hypersonic weapons have a speed of around 343 meters per second, many times faster than the speed of sound.
They are regarded as weapons of the future.
Development of underwater torpedo continues
It is said that the Poseidon underwater torpedo, to which atomic warheads can be fitted, is still being developed.
The planned underwater drone is aimed at destroying coastal targets.
The President, who also rode in a military boat, said that in this year alone, 40 new ships would come into service for the largest country in the world’s various naval units.
Russia has a larger coastal area than any other country in the world.
The navy has reliably protected Russia for 300 years, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors throughout the country.
Naval forces at many other Russian coastal locations also celebrated the day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting beside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength with a weapons display in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Shells were also fired there.
In a video released by the Defense Ministry, not only warships, including a submarine, were visible, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Russia: Day of the Marines: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for battleships
The Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that battleships will be equipped with state-of-the-art, hypersonic weapons.
The battle options of the Russian navel forces has been expanded with the addition of these advanced weapons, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central Marine Parade.
The defense minister further informed the Interfax Agency about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket Zirkon, which was built for the marines.
The hypersonic weapons run at a multitude of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are weapons of the future.
Underwater torpedoes have also been further developed
There is apparently also further development on the Poseidon underwater torpedo-system, which can carry nuclear pay loads.
The planned sea drone is designed for destroying costal targets.
The president, who also arrived on a military vessel, said that 40 new ships were put into operation by the individual navel units of the largest country on earth in this year alone.
Russia has the largest costal region in the world.
The marines have reliably protected Russia for 300 years, Putin said on this day celebrated by sailors across the country.
The navel forces accompanied the Day of the Marines with parades in many other Russian costal locations.
In Syria, where Russia has fought on the side of the ruler Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength with a weapons show in the Mediterranean harbor of Tartus.
Rounds was also fired off there.
In one of the videos, which was published by the Ministry of Defense, there were not only battleships, including a submarine, but also armed helicopters and fighter jets.
Hurricane “Hanna” reaches Texas: Aid impeded by coronavirus
Washington - The first hurricane of the season over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the US state, announced the National Hurricane Center of the US climate authority NOAA Saturday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous counties.
The coronavirus pandemic raging in Texas made work difficult for aid workers, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees told to be cautious
“Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge,” Abbott said according to the newspaper “Houston Chronicle.”
With regard to the hurricane in Texas, he added: “This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most heavily hit by Covid-19 in the state.”
According to Johns-Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should observe practices “that we have gotten used to,” such as wearing masks, said the governor according to the channel CBS.
It is important that everyone maintains social distance.
That is why hotel rooms have also been provided in some locations.
In addition, coronavirus testing is to be performed in emergency lodging.
Damage was initially only reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning retracted again
With wind speeds of up to 150 km/h, “Hanna” made landfall on Padre Island right in front of the Texan coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm was upgraded to the lowest level hurricane just before this.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was initially issued and then later retracted.
Authorities expected the storm to weaken as “Hanna” moves further inland and head towards northeastern Mexico.
“Douglas” moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane “Douglas” was on the move Saturday night at wind speeds of around 150 km/h heading towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected the hurricane to weaken further.
Models predict it should be near to the largest Hawaiian island on Sunday (local time) - but then it will be a storm, just before the hurricane threshold.
NOAA expected a more active hurricane season over the Atlantic than average this year, according to a forecast from May.
Up to ten hurricanes are expected from June to the end of November, six of which could become very strong, authorities stated.
On average, there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic per year, while three of them develop into severe storms.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent and the probability of a below-average season is just 10 percent, information says.
US president Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration was observing the storms closely and he is in contact with the affected states.
Hurricane “Hanna” reaches Texas. Providing help impeded due to Corona
Washington - The first Hurricane of this year’s season over the Atlantic made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rain now threatened parts of the US state, reported the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Agency NOAA in the night before Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared the state of emergency for numerous districts.
The Corona epidemic that rages in Texas, would impede the work of helpers, continued Abbott according to US media reports.
Evacuated people were warned to be careful.
“Every hurricane poses an enormous challenge”, said Abbott according to the newspaper “Houston Chronicle”.
Glancing at the hurricane in Texas, he added: “This challenge is complicated and will still be intensified when one considers that the hurricane races through an area of the state that is hit hardest by the Corona-19 crisis”.
According to reports from the Johns-Hopkins-University, so far 5000 people have died in Texas alone due to the Corona epidemic.
Abbott told the people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices - like wearing masks - “which they got used to”, said the governor according to the station CBS.
It would be important that all keep social distances.
Therefore, in some locations hotel rooms had been provided.
Beside that, Corona testing should be performed in emergency shelters.
Hurricane damages had so far only be reported from the coastal town Port Mansfield.
Storm warning was cancelled
According to official information “Hanna” had made landfall with wind speeds of up to 150 km/h on Padre Island directly in front of the Texan coast.
Before that the tropical storm was classified as hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal regions Port Mansfield up to Sargent a storm surge warning had been issued which had been taken back later.
Authorities expected a weakening while “Hanna” would travel further inland and take course to Mexico’s northeast.
“Douglas” moves towards Hawaii
Hurricane “Douglas” was on its way in the Pacific Ocean with wind speeds of 150 km/h in the direction of Hawaii in the night before Sunday.
However, the hurricane center expected that this hurricane would weaken.
Due to the forecast the hurricane should be near the largest island of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below hurricane strength.
According to a forecast in May the NOAA expected an above average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
From June to the end of November one would have to reckon with up to ten hurricanes, up to six could become very strong hurricanes, explained authorities.
On average there are about six hurricanes over the Atlantic per year, three of them develop to storms of immense strength.
Based on available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and the Caribbean the probability of a normal season would be only at 30 percent, the of an below average season only at ten percent, it was then stated.
US President Trump wrote on Twitter that his government observed the storms very closely and would be in contact with the respective federal states.
Four goals denied: Video Assistant Referee “penalizes” Sassuolo
Sassuolo’s Filip Djuricic was denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio had a dark evening with 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian soccer league Serie A - and was really mad at the VAR.
“A festival of disallowed goals for Sassuolo.
VAR has never been so hard on a team,” commented the “Corriere dello Sport.”
Host Naples took the lead in the 8th minute with a goal from wing back Elseid Hisaj, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially celebrated the equalizer.
The video assistant referee (VAR) withdrew the goal due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the back of the net again - and again the VAR intervened.
The goals from striker Francesco Caputo (50th minute) and Domenico Berardi (61st minute) were withdrawn by the team of referees at the VAR’s instruction.
During injury time, Allan shot the final 2:0 score for Naples, cementing the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
“VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology set records,” writes the “Gazzetta dello Sport.”
Four goals were annulled: Video assistant “punishes” Sassuolo
Sassuolo’s Filip Djuricic was even denied two goals.
Naples - Four goals scored - four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch black day with a 0:2 (0:1) defeat at SSC Naples in the Italian soccer league series A - and was really upset with the video assistant of the referees.
“A festival of denied goals for Sassuolo.
Never before did the VAR decide against a team so hard”, commented the “Corriere dello Sport”.
Host Naples had taken the lead through a goal by full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute celebrated Filip Djuricic initially the equalizer.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) annulled the goal because of offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - the VAR intervened again.
Also goals by forward Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were denied by the referee team after consulting with the VAR.
In extra time Allan made the 2:0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
“The VAR is for Sassuolo worse than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology writes records”, commented the “Gazzetta dello Sport”.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - Initial preparations for the Champions League began with a blow for two-time winner FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who had recovered “relatively well” after a short vacation and few training days, must already be wondering after the first team training how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury to world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third-most play time behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a torn ligament on his left tarsal and could miss crucial top class duels.
In the lousy Munich weather, the right defender broke off a training game and was carted off the field.
It remains to be seen how long the unrestricted regular player will have to take off from the battle for the title.
It will be tough to play in the quarter finals against FC Chelsea on August 8, but the 24 year old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12.
But Bavarians don’t want be stopped from training by the bad luck on Sunday.
Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to the Portuguese capital in his personal triple formula.
His hungry for victory title-winners should demonstrate quality, intensity and concentration on the (ideally) 28-day route to the top class final game on August 23.
“Quite simply, we have excellently mastered the necessary tasks for the Championship and the Cup.
Now it’s time to do something special,” says Flick.
But before the Munich team can start to specifically think about the final tournament and a training camp on the Algarve before that, they first have to face FC Chelsea in the quarter finals.
After the 3:0 in the first leg before the coronavirus break, the Londoners may not again become a Bavarian nightmare in the home arena like in the lost “Finale Dahoam” [final at home] in 2012.
“First we have to walk through the door.
We want to win, create good conditions and fill up our confidence with a good game,” requires Flick.
They will be tested on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
In a long speech, Flick committed his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including precious addition Leroy Sané, who was meeting all his new colleagues on the field after switching from Manchester City.
“Leroy has fit in well like all new guys,” reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season when Sané and company will no longer be able to just train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champions.
After days of training individually and in small groups, they will now train as a full team to prepare for the Londoners, who unlike Flick’s ensemble are already in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munich team could face a quarter final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, and in the semi-finals the possible opponents are Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.
The path to the final in Lisbon “is not that easy,” emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant-in-training Miroslav Klose, starting on Tuesday.
The world championship record goal scorer and Flick know what matters when going from 0-100 from preparing for so many tournaments.
With his current team, the work is “a delight,” praises Flick.
The “focus on winning” is an impressive characteristic of his team.
They excitedly competed with nine-man teams on Sunday.
All of the performers were there, including Thiago, who wants to leave, and defender David Alaba, who is not guaranteed to stay beyond the Champions League season.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured

Hansi Flick, “somewhat well” recovered after a short vacation and a few days of training must - after the first team training - already think about how he can restructure his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who featured the third most minutes of use behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury on the left tarsal and will possibly miss decisive duels in the king’s class.
The right-back aborted a practice game in the Munich foul weather and left the field on a golf cart.
For how long the unlimited regular player must pause in the fight about titles remains open.
His use in the second round return match against the FC Chelsea on August 8 is hardly possible, the 24 year old player may hope for his use in the final tournament in Lisbon beginning on August 12.
However, the Bayern let this misfortune from the practice field on Sunday stop them.
Flick named the three attributes in his personal triple formula that he expects from his stars on the way to the Portuguese capital.

“We have simply brilliantly mastered the obligatory tasks with championship and cup final.
Now it is time to still achieve the very special”, said Flick.
However, before the Munich team can focus on the final tournament, and prior to that a training camp on the Algarve, the round of sixteen obligation against the FC Chelsea is lined up.
After the 3:0 victory in the first leg game before the Corona break the London club should not become another Bayern nightmare again such as in the lost “Final at home” in 2012.
“First, we have to go through the door.
We want to win, create good conditions and fuel our confidence with a good game”, demanded Flick.
A test for fine-tuning is lined up against Olympique Marseille on Friday.
Flick had sworn his stars with a long speech to an unique August after the team had a 13 day vacation after winning the double.
He greeted 31 players at the Säbener Straße, among them the new players around special purchase Leroy Sané who met all new colleagues on the field for the first time after his transfer from Manchester City.
“Leroy, like all the other new ones, has fir in very well”, reported Flick.
But instead to talk about the new season when Sané & co. are not only participants in diverse practice units Flick prefers to talk about the current title project of the German serial champion.
After day of individual and small group practices one trains now as a team for the game against Chelsea which is in game rhythm contrary to the Flick ensemble.
After that the FC Bayern may face a quarterfinal against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon “is not that easy”, emphasized the head coach who can rely on the practice services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose, starting on Tuesday.
The world champion record scorer Klose and Flick know about some common tournament preparation where the 0-to-100 percent atonement is so decisive.
Working with his current team would be a “pleasure”, praised Flick.
“Focusing on winning” is an impressive characteristic of his team.
At the tournament with teams of nine it really got down to business on Sunday.
All top performers were present even the transfer-willing Thiago and full-back David Alaba whose remaining in the team is uncertain beyond the king’s class season.

New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has made a name for herself with her tireless efforts for the “Fridays For Future” movement.

“How far people go to distract from the climate crisis,” she stated.
She said she has experienced “everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of kids take to the streets.”
She thinks heads of state and leading politicians who make fun of her on social media or even try to silence her are “funny,” because their reactions show that “they don’t have any other response.”
Things got particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a famous scene in which she threw a mean look at the US president Trump.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green dies
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a swift ascent with Fleetwood Mac, things went sharply downhill and then slowly upwards again.
Now blues-rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, reported family members on Saturday in an official announcement, with a further announcement to come in the next few days.
Leading musicians such as Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional reaction, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a “monumental loss” for all former and current members of Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green founded the legendary group in London in 1967, and their dreamy instrumental hit “Albatross” has never been forgotten.
The musician’s ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") life resembled a roller coaster ride.
Green experienced a dramatic rise with Fleetwood Mac - but the group then enjoyed its greatest successes without him.
It is said that one dispute occurred because Green wanted to donate all of the band’s earnings to good causes.
He began to perform in flowing robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a part.
Green left the band three years after it was formed, in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues-rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time Green received psychiatric treatment.
The musician vanished into thin air for a large part of the 1970s.
It is said that he sometimes lived on the streets, worked as a gardener in a cemetery, and spent some time on a kibbutz in Israel.
Green was born in 1946, the son of a Jewish working-class family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
Even when he was young he loved American blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
He learned his first guitar chords when he was eleven.
At the age of 15 the teenager began playing the guitar professionally and five years later he got the chance to take the stage as the lead guitarist for instrumental band Peter B’s Looners.
A little later he was hired by the Bluesbreakers as the replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the summer of 1967, in the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac along with his Bluesbreaker co-members Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song “Albatross”, composed by Green, brought the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69, and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But soon the rapid ascent showed its darker sides - Green was unable to cope with the media hype and his experiments with LSD grew increasingly extreme.
Later, in an interview, he commented on life between music and addiction, “The worst thing that has happened to me in my life is the drugs; the best was landing a number 1 hit”.
Towards the end of the decade, in 1979, Green surprisingly had a notable success with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, without him, Fleetwood Mac were swimming on a wave of success with a new line-up.
Their album “Rumours”, released in 1977, sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various minor solo successes, Green did not achieve any major comeback until he started afresh with a group of his musician friends in 1996.
At the time, Britain’s “Daily Telegraph” spoke of a rock star that had come back down to earth.
Free of drugs, Green and the Peter Green Splinter Group released various albums before the band split up in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend even in his own lifetime - and with his gentle sound he was one of the most influential guitarists of recent decades.

Among other factors, there were fights because Green wanted to donate the profits of the group to good causes.
He started to appear in wide robes and with a giant crucifix.
Mental-health issues also seemed to have played a role.
Green left in 1970 just three years after founding the band.
A social descent followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers report.
Green was treated in the psychiatric ward for a long time.
The musician disappeared from the scene for a large part of the 1970s.
He supposedly lived on the street for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent sometime in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal.
In his younger years he was already excited about US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
He learned his first guitar chords at eleven.
At 15 the teenager started to play professional guitar and got the chance five years later to stand on stage as the lead guitarist for the instrumental group Peter B’s Looners.
A little later he was working as the stand-in for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
“Albatross”, a song composed by Green, ensured the group their first No.1 hit in the winter of 1968/1969 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
The quick accent showed its dark side quickly: Green did not deal with the media circus well and his experiments with the drug LSD got progressively more extreme.
He commented later in an interview about his life between music and addiction: “The worst that happened to me in life was the drugs, the best was to land the no.1 hit”.
At the end of the decade, Green managed a surprising, respectable achievement in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac in the meantime floated on a wave of success in a new formation without him.
The 1977 album “Rumours“ sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
In spite of small solo successes, Green never managed a great comeback, until he started anew in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British “Daily Telegraph” spoke at the time from a rockstar come back from the grave.
Green released a few albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group before the band broke up in 2004.
He was already a blues legend for music experts during his lifetime, and an influential guitarist of past decades with his gentle sounds.
